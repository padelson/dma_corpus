-iii-        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of December 18, 2003
by and among Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), EAC
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), Expertcity.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY"), Edward G. Sim as stockholder representative (the "STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE"), and Andreas von Blottnitz as the initial Contingent
Consideration Representative.   RECITALS   A Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company intend to effect a merger (the "MERGER") of Merger Sub with and into
the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and to the extent applicable the
California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), with the Company to be the
surviving corporation of the Merger. Following the Merger, Parent will merge
(the "LLC MERGER") the Surviving Corporation with and into a Delaware limited
liability company wholly-owned by Parent (the "LLC"), with the LLC to be the
surviving entity of the LLC Merger.   B The Merger and the LLC Merger are
intended to be part of an integrated plan and together are intended to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and this Agreement is
intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the
regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code.   C The Board of
Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is
fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) determined to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and approve the Merger.   D The respective Boards of Directors
of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   E
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, each of the Persons listed on SCHEDULE 1 hereto is entering
into a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the
"VOTING AGREEMENT").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants,
promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree as follows:       ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. At
the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."   1.2
EFFECTIVE TIME. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place as
promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days, following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the offices
of Testa, Hurwitz and Thibeault, LLP, 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts
unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Closing would otherwise occur during the
Earnings Period, the Closing shall be deferred until the first Business Day
following the Earnings Period. The date upon which the Closing occurs is
herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE." On the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of
Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B (the
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER"), with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of
acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing
being referred to herein as the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   1.3 EFFECT OF THE
MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the rights and property of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts and liabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts and liabilities of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BY-LAWS.   (a)
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation
is Expertcity.com, Inc."   (b) At the Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger
Sub shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended.     -2-    1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The director(s) of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
director(s) of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   1.6
MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK.   (a) MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The aggregate consideration (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") to be paid by Parent
and Merger Sub in the Merger to holders of outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be (x) $225 million plus the Option Proceeds less the
Acquisition Expenses and less the Medicare Amount (the "INITIAL MERGER
CONSIDERATION") plus (y) the Contingent Consideration. The Merger
Consideration shall be payable in cash and in shares of common stock of
Parent, par value $.001 per share (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK"), as set forth
in this Section 1.6.   (b) EFFECT ON COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock
(the "STOCKHOLDERS"), each share of Company Capital Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted into the right to
receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.8 hereof, the Per Share
Initial Merger Consideration and the Per Share Contingent Consideration, in
each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including without limitation this Section 1.6 and the escrow
provisions set forth in Article IX hereof.   The Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration shall be payable in a combination of cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock, with (i) the cash portion (the "CASH CONSIDERATION") being an
amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Per Share
Initial Merger Consideration by (y) the Applicable Fraction and (ii) the
stock portion (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION") being a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Per Share
Initial Merger Consideration less the Cash Consideration by (y) the Parent
Average Closing Price. The Per Share Contingent Consideration shall be
payable in shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Parent Average Closing
Price as set forth in Section 1.6(f).   (c) COMPANY STANDARD OPTIONS. The
Company shall take all action necessary or required under the Standard Option
Plan and the option agreements representing the Standard Options (the "OPTION
AGREEMENTS") to (i) accelerate the vesting of all Standard Options effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) cause such Standard
Options to be exercised, and if not exercised terminated, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) terminate the Standard
Option Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.    
-3-    (d) REDESIGNATION. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 1.6, if Parent and the Stockholder Representative reasonably
conclude that the aggregate fair market value as of the Closing Date of the
Parent Common Stock issuable at the Effective Time (I.E., excluding the
Contingent Consideration) to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.6
(the "CONTINUITY SHARES") is less than 45% of the sum of (A) the aggregate
fair market value as of the Closing Date of the Continuity Shares and (B) the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this
Section 1.6, including the Escrow Amount otherwise payable to the
Stockholders, plus any other amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e) to the extent a proprietary interest in the Company would not be
treated as preserved for purposes of applying Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e) to the Merger as a result of the receipt of such amounts
(including without limitation amounts payable with respect to Dissenting
Shares) (the sum of (A) and (B) is referred to as the "TOTAL CONTINUITY
MERGER CONSIDERATION"), then the Applicable Fraction shall be adjusted
downward such that, after such adjustment, the Continuity Shares have an
aggregate fair market value as of the Closing Date equal to 45% of the Total
Continuity Merger Consideration; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall
the Applicable Fraction with respect to any share of Company Capital Stock
that was acquired pursuant to the exercise, during the period from the date
of this Agreement through and including the Closing, of a Nonstatutory Option
be reduced. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be responsible
for all computations contemplated by this Section 1.6(d) and all such
computations shall be conclusive and binding on the Stockholders. For
the purposes of the redesignation calculations set forth in this Section
1.6(d), (i) all Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be receiving only Cash
Consideration, and (ii) appropriate adjustments shall be made to the extent
Parent and the Stockholder Representative determine that shares of Company
Capital Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of Standard Options should
not be counted as outstanding for purposes of this Section 1.6(d).   (e)
FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued, but in lieu thereof, each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such
Stockholder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price.   (f)
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.   (i) The Contingent Consideration shall be
calculated in accordance with SCHEDULE 1.6(F).   (ii) The right to receive
the Contingent Consideration, if any, payable pursuant to this Agreement is a
contract right only and no certificate evidencing such right shall be issued.
The right to receive the Contingent Consideration pursuant to the Merger
shall not be transferred or assigned, other than to Affiliates.   (iii) If
at the end of any fiscal quarter during 2004, Surviving Business Revenue for
such fiscal quarter (A) is not less than eighty percent (80%) of the forecast
for that fiscal quarter as detailed in the    -4-   Company\'s Business
Plan provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "BUSINESS
Plan") and Surviving Business Gross Margin for such fiscal quarter is not
less than eighty-five percent (85%), then during 2004 Parent shall not cause
fundamental business changes materially adversely affecting the Surviving
Business\' ability to meet the Business Plan without the express consent of
the Contingent Consideration Representative (as defined below); and (B) is
less than the forecast for that fiscal quarter as detailed in the Business
Plan, then Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative
shall discuss in good faith possible changes to the Business Plan.   (iv)
The Contingent Consideration, if any, shall be payable as follows:   (A)
Parent shall pay the Contingent Consideration, if any, on a date that shall
be no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the final financial statements
of the Surviving Business for the calendar year ending December 31, 2004 are
released by the Surviving Business Auditors, and further provided that such
date may be extended pursuant to Section 1.6(f)(v)(B) (the "CONTINGENT
CLOSING DATE"). Promptly after the Contingent Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
issuable as Contingent Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.6 for payment
to the Stockholders in accordance with this Section 1.6. Such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be determined by dividing the Contingent
Consideration determined pursuant to SCHEDULE 1.6(F) by the Parent Average
Closing Price.   (B) Only those Stockholders who have properly transmitted
their Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent along with a duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal as set forth in Section 1.8 shall be
entitled to receive the Contingent Consideration, if any, payable pursuant to
this Agreement.   (v) (A) As soon as practicable following the end of the
twelve month period ending December 31, 2004, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Business Auditors to review the financial statements for the
Surviving Business for the year ending December 31, 2004, which statements
shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis and consistent with the accounting principles
and practices on the basis of which Parent\'s audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2004 are prepared. Parent shall use such
financial statements to promptly prepare a written calculation of the
Contingent Consideration, if any, payable in respect of such period and shall
deliver a copy of such calculation with reasonable back-up data and a
statement showing the method of computing the Contingent Consideration (if
any) together with the audited financial statements of the Surviving Business
to the President of the Surviving Business (the "CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
REPRESENTATIVE"), within thirty (30) days after such financial statements are
released by the Surviving Business Auditors. In performing it duties under
this Section 1.6(f), the Contingent Consideration Representative shall keep
the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed and consider in good faith
advice given by the Stockholder Representative.      -5-    (B) If the
Contingent Consideration Representative disagrees with Parent\'s calculation
of Contingent Consideration, the Contingent Consideration Representative may,
within ten (10) days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section
1.6(f)(v)(A), deliver a notice to Parent disagreeing with such calculation
and setting forth the Contingent Consideration Representative\'s calculation
of the Contingent Consideration. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the
Contingent Consideration Representative disagrees. Upon receipt of any such
notice, the Contingent Closing Date specified in Section 1.6(f)(iv)(A) shall
be extended as required until Parent and the Contingent Consideration
Representative agree in writing to the calculation of
Contingent Consideration.   (C) If the Contingent
Consideration Representative shall have delivered a notice of disagreement
within the ten (10) day period referred to in Section 1.6(f)(v)(B), the
Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent shall, during the twenty
(20) days following such delivery, use good faith efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Contingent
Consideration. If the Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent are
unable to reach agreement concerning the Contingent Consideration during that
period, they shall promptly thereafter cause KPMG, LLP (the "ACCOUNTING
REFEREE") promptly to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Contingent Consideration. In making such calculations, the
Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in Parent\'s
calculations of the Contingent Consideration as to which the Contingent
Consideration Representative has disagreed in writing. The Accounting Referee
shall deliver to the Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent as
promptly as practicable a report setting forth the Accounting Referee\'s
calculation of the disputed amounts. Such report shall be final and binding
upon the Contingent Consideration Representative, Parent, the
Surviving Business, the Stockholders, and all other parties to this
Agreement. The Parent and the Stockholders shall each pay their own fees and
expenses and one-half of the costs and charges of the Accounting Referee\'s
review and report. The Stockholders\' share of the costs will first be
deducted from the Contingent Consideration and then from the Escrow Amount,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.5(b).   (vi) In the event
that during fiscal year 2004, (i) any two of the following employees of the
Company are terminated for reasons other than "Cause" or terminate their
employment for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in their respective
employment agreements with Parent): Andreas von Blotnitz, John Greathouse and
Brian Donahoo, (ii) Parent shall sell or otherwise transfer for value all or
substantially all of either the Company\'s stock or assets or Parent\'s
assets, (iii) Parent shall merge or consolidate with another corporation and
in connection therewith the holders of common stock of Parent shall receive,
in exchange for their shares, cash or stock or other securities of another
corporation, (iv) a tender offer shall be consummated resulting in a person,
entity or group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of Parent, or (v)
the Company or the business of the Company shall be acquired substantially in
its entirety as a going concern, then in each such event, Parent shall pay
the maximum Contingent Consideration ($12,000,000) to the Stockholders
concurrently with the consummation of any such event.     -6-    (vii)
In the event that the Closing does not occur on or prior to March 10, 2004,
then Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative shall in good
faith discuss whether the terms of SCHEDULE 1.6(F) should be modified to
reflect the delay in the Closing; and, if so determined by Parent and the
Contingent Consideration Representative, then Parent and the Contingent
Consideration Representative shall mutually agree on the terms of any such
modification.   (g) TAX WITHHOLDING. Parent and the Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or the
Company determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment, or the exercise of Standard Options, under the Code
or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so required
to be deducted or withheld from any payment exceeds the cash portion of the
consideration, if any, otherwise payable to such Person, Parent and the
Company are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market
value such portion of consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient
funds to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in order to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement.   (h) ESCROW. At
Closing, Parent, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall deposit with the Escrow
Agent $33,750,000 in cash (the "ESCROW AMOUNT"). Each Stockholder shall be
deemed to have contributed his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount to provide a source of funding to the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses for which they are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Article IX.
"PRO RATA PORTION" of the Escrow Amount shall mean, with respect to each
Stockholder, that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to a fraction,
the numerator of which is the value of the consideration to be received by
such Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and the denominator of which is
the value of the consideration to be received by all Stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.6(b). For purposes of calculating the value of the consideration to
be received pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the value of each
share of Parent Common Stock shall be the Parent Average Closing Price.  
(i) CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED AND COMPANY-OWNED STOCK. Each share of
Company Capital Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration therefor.   (j) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER
SUB. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.    -7-     1.7
DISSENTING SHARES.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder who
either has demanded and perfected appraisal or dissenters\' rights for such
shares in accordance with the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable, and who, as of
the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal
or dissenters\' rights, or who, as of the Effective Time, retains the right
to demand and perfect dissenters\' rights under the CGCL (collectively,
"DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL or
the CGCL, as applicable.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(a), if any Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through passage of time, failure to
demand or perfect, or otherwise) the right to demand and perfect appraisal or
dissenters\' rights under the DGCL and the CGCL, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares that
were Dissenting Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to
Section 1.6 (including Section 1.6(h)), without interest thereon upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.   (c) The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Capital Stock, demands for purchase by the Company of

served pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable, on the Company and

respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or demands for purchase under
the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands

Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment
or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such
shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any other costs or
expenses (including specifically, but without limitation, attorneys\' fees,
costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in
connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (other
than payments for such shares) (together "DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"), Parent
shall be indemnified under the terms of Article IX for the amount of such
Dissenting Share Payments.    -8-     1.8 SURRENDER OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate EquiServe, Inc. and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.
(collectively, "EQUISERVE") or, if not EquiServe, then a United States bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange
agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. At
the later of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the completion of the
redesignation calculations pursuant to Section 1.6(d), but in no event more
than two (2) Business Days following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be
mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the
"CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (A) a letter of transmittal (the
"LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") which shall specify that delivery of Certificates
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash
Consideration. The Letter of Transmittal shall indicate that applicable
withholding Taxes with respect to the exercise of Nonstatutory Options will
be withheld from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable to each Stockholder
that acquired shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a
Nonstatutory Option. Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
together with surrender of a Certificate (or Certificates) for cancellation,
the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (less the cash proceeds
to be deposited with the Escrow Agent on such holder\'s behalf) and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6(e), and the
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration provided for in this Article I.   (c)
PARENT TO PROVIDE PARENT COMMON STOCK AND CASH. Promptly after the Effective
Time and the completion of the redesignation calculations pursuant to Section
1.6(d), Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Section 1.8 the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
and Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 as Initial Merger
Consideration in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, on behalf of the Stockholders, Parent shall deposit
the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.6(h)
and Article IX.   (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect
to the    -9-   shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange
therefor until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable
upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock for cash.   (e) TRANSFERS OF
OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or will have established to the satisfaction
of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (f) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   1.9 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. The
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts paid upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.10 LOST, STOLEN OR
DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, as
may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out    -10-   the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation (or the LLC, after the LLC Merger) with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action.   1.12 LLC MERGER. Within ten (10) Business Days following
the Closing Date, Parent will consummate the LLC Merger.    ARTICLE II  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Subject to such exceptions
as are disclosed in the disclosure letter dated as of the date hereof and
delivered herewith to Parent (the "COMPANY SCHEDULES") (each of which
exceptions disclosed in one section of the Company Schedules shall be deemed
disclosed in each other section provided it is reasonably apparent on its
face that the matter is responsive to the representation to which such other
section relates), the Company hereby represents and warrants to each of
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   2.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY. The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the full
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and as now proposed to be
conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in the State of California and in each
other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership,
leasing, holding or use of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
except such other jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered a true and correct
copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended to date
and in full force and effect on the date hereof, to Parent. SCHEDULE
2.1 lists every state or foreign jurisdiction in which the Company has
facilities, maintains an office or has an employee.   2.2 SUBSIDIARIES. The
Company does not own and has never otherwise owned, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock of or any other equity interest in, or controlled, directly
or indirectly, any other Person, and the Company is not and has not otherwise
been, directly or indirectly, a party to, member of or participant in any
partnership, joint venture or similar business entity. The Company has no
Subsidiaries.   2.3 COMPANY CAPITAL STRUCTURE.   (a) The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of: 31,552,548 shares of Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), of which 6,889,131
shares are issued and outstanding; and 8,223,726 shares of Preferred Stock,

Preferred Stock, all of which shares are issued and outstanding; 1,552,031
shares have been designated Series B Preferred Stock, all of which shares are
issued and outstanding; and 3,529,570 shares have been designated Series C
Preferred Stock, all of which shares are issued and outstanding. No other
shares of Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. The Company Capital
Stock, including all shares subject to the Company\'s right of repurchase, is
held of record by the Persons, with the addresses of record and in the

Company Capital Stock (i) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights created by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any
agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, and (ii)
have been offered, sold and delivered by the Company in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable federal, state, foreign or local
statutes, laws, rules or regulations, including federal and state securities

the Company are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.
There are no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any
shares of Company Capital Stock.   (b) Except for the Company\'s 1998 Stock
Plan (the "STANDARD OPTION PLAN"), neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has ever adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan
or any other plan or agreement providing for equity compensation to any
Person. The Standard Option Plan has been duly authorized, approved and
adopted by the Company\'s board of directors and its stockholders and is in
full force and effect. The Company has reserved a total of 5,999,602 shares
of Company Common Stock for issuance to employees and directors of, and
consultants to, the Company under the Standard Option Plan, of which (i)
5,036,646 shares are issuable, as of the date hereof, upon the exercise of
outstanding, unexercised stock options granted pursuant to the Standard
Option Plan (the "STANDARD OPTIONS"), (ii) 178,285 shares are available for
grant but have not yet been granted pursuant to the Standard Option Plan, and
(iii) 757,131 shares have been issued and are outstanding pursuant to
the prior exercise of stock options or other stock rights granted pursuant to
the Standard Option Plan. No outstanding Standard Option permits payment of
the exercise price therefor by any means other than cash or check. All
outstanding Standard Options (collectively, the "COMPANY OPTIONS") have been

respects with all applicable federal, state, foreign or local statutes, laws,

statements of operations and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, and (ii) the unaudited balance
sheet of the Company (the "COMPANY BALANCE SHEET") as of September 30, 2003
(the "BALANCE SHEET DATE") and the related unaudited statements of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the nine month period
then ended (the financial statements referred to in items (i) and (ii),
collectively, the "COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Company Financial
Statements are accurate in all material respects and have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles effective in the
United States ("GAAP") applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods
indicated and consistent with each other, except for the absence of footnotes
in the case of the unaudited Company Financial Statements. The
Company Financial Statements fairly presented, in all material respects, the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as
of the dates and during the periods indicated therein, subject, in the case
of the unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments, which
were not material in amount or significance.   (b) The Company has in place
effective "internal control over financial reporting" (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Since January
1, 2001, neither the Company nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, any director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their internal controls over financial
reporting, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. During the periods covered by the Company Financial Statements,
(i) there have been no changes in the Company\'s internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company\'s internal control over financial
reporting; and (ii) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting have
been reported to the Company\'s Board of Directors and the Company\'s
external auditors, and any such reports are identified in SCHEDULE 2.7. To
the Company\'s knowledge, there have been no instances of fraud, whether or
not material, that occurred during any period covered by the
Company Financial Statements involving the management of the Company or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Company\'s
internal control over financial reporting.   (c) To the Company\'s
knowledge, no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary has provided or is
providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission
or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any part of their respective operations. To the Company\'s
knowledge, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any officer, employee,
contractor, subcontractor or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary   
-15-   has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any
other manner discriminated against an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).   (d) During the
periods covered by the Company Financial Statements, the Company\'s external
auditor was independent of the Company and its management. For purposes of
this Section 2.7(d), "independent of the Company and its management" shall
mean that the Company and its external auditor complied at all times with the
auditor independence requirements of Title II of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission and any regulatory body claiming
jurisdiction over the accounting profession as if the Company were an issuer
with a class of securities registered pursuant to the Exchange Act during the
periods covered by the Company Financials.   (e) SCHEDULE 2.7 sets forth any
and all reports by the Company\'s external auditors to the Company\'s Board
of Directors, or any committee thereof, or the Company\'s management
concerning any of the following and pertaining to any period covered by the
Company Financial Statements: critical accounting policies, internal control
over financial reporting, significant accounting estimates or judgements,
alternative accounting treatments and any required communications with the
Company\'s Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, or management of the
Company.   2.8 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
2.8, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (a) any
liability, indebtedness, obligation, expense, claim, deficiency, guaranty or
endorsement of any type, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, matured,
unmatured or other (whether or not required to be reflected in Company
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP), which (i) exceeds $100,000
individually or in the aggregate and (ii) has not (x) been reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet or (y) arisen in the ordinary course of the Company\'s
business consistent with past practices since the Balance Sheet Date or (b)
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as such term is defined in Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act).   2.9

commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree to which the Company or any

ENCUMBRANCES.   (a) (i) None of the real property, and leases and
subleases of, and other interests in, real property, used or occupied by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, together with all buildout,
fixtures and improvements created thereon ("REAL PROPERTY") is owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ever owned any Real Property. All of the Real Property is leased
or subleased by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Company or one

warehousing, license or occupancy agreement ("LEASED REAL PROPERTY").  
(ii) SCHEDULE 2.12(A)(II) sets forth all leases, subleases and other

respect to each such Lease, the identity of the landlord or sublandlord, the
date of such Lease and each amendment thereto, the aggregate annual rent, and
the address of all buildings.   (iii) The Leases are in good standing and
are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
and there does not exist under any such Lease any default by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge, by any other Person,
or any event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, by any other Person. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete copies of all Leases, including all amendments and agreements
related thereto, and the Leases constitute the entire agreement between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each landlord or sublandlord with
respect to the Leased Real Property. All rent and other charges currently due
and payable under the Leases have been paid.   (iv) The Company or one of
its Subsidiaries is the holder of the tenant\'s interest under the Leases and
has not assigned the Leases nor subleased all or any portion of the premises
leased thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made
any material alterations, additions or improvements to the premises leased
under the Leases that are required to be removed (or of which any landlord or
sublandlord could require removal) at the termination of the respective Lease
terms. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns all trade fixtures,
equipment and personal property located in the premises leased under the
Leases and the landlords thereunder have no Lien thereon or claim
thereto.   (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets,
real, personal    -20-   and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, free and clear of any Liens, except as reflected in the Company
Financial Statements or in SCHEDULE 2.12(B) and except for liens for ad
valorem Taxes not yet due and payable and such imperfections of title and
encumbrances, if any, which are not material in character, amount or extent,
and which do not materially detract from the value, or materially interfere
with the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected
thereby.   (c) All facilities, machinery, equipment, fixtures,
vehicles, and other personal properties owned, leased or used by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries are (i) adequate for the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently
proposed to be conducted and (ii) in good operating condition, subject to
normal wear and tear, and reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for
which they are being used, except where a failure to be in such condition
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has sold, transferred, disclosed, made available
to the public or otherwise released for distribution any of its customer
files and other customer information relating to the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries current and former customers (the "COMPANY CUSTOMER
INFORMATION"). Except for information as provided to sales representatives
(which information is subject to a customary non-disclosure agreement), no
Person other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries possesses or has any
claims or rights with respect to use of the Company Customer Information.  
(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or breach
of any agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and vendors
of online or offline credit card payment services, including without
limitation agreements between the Company and Wells Fargo Merchant Services,
L.L.C., American Express, Discover Novus Network and iPayment, Inc. If any
credit card payment services agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries currently is a party were terminated, the Company knows of no
reason why the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be unable to enter
into alternative credit card payment services arrangements at least as
favorable to the Company as any of its current credit card payment services
arrangements. To the Company\'s knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is listed on a "global watch list" in connection with
credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval requests. The Company\'s business
as now being conducted and as now proposed to be conducted is not reasonably
expected to produce excessive credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval
requests (as defined under any agreement, terms, policies or conditions of
any vendor of online or offline credit card payment services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) or to place the Company on any "global watch
list" in connection with credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval
requests.   2.13 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. SCHEDULE 2.13 lists each
material consent, license, permit, grant or other authorization issued to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity (i) pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently operates or holds any
interest in any of its properties or (ii) which is required for the operation
of its business as currently conducted or as currently proposed to be
conducted or the holding of any such interest (herein collectively called
"COMPANY AUTHORIZATIONS"). The Company Authorizations are in full force and
effect and    -21-   constitute all Company Authorizations required to
permit the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to operate or conduct its
business as currently conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted or
to hold any interest in its properties or assets.   2.14 INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.   (a) SCHEDULE 2.14(A) lists: (i) all Company
Registered Intellectual Property; (ii) all hardware products and tools,
software and firmware products and tools and services that are currently
sold, published, offered, or under development by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries; and (iii) all licenses (in and out), sublicenses and other
agreements to which the Company and any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person
is authorized to use any of the Company Intellectual Property or exercise any
rights with respect thereto, other than in-bound "shrink-wrap" end-user
licenses and similar generally available commercial binary code end-user
licenses in each case that are not used for software development or in any
software, products or services provided by the Company to customers.   (b)
Each item of Company Intellectual Property is either: (i) owned solely by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens; or (ii)
rightfully used and authorized for use by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries and their permitted successors pursuant to a valid
and enforceable written license or other written grant of a right by a third
party to use its proprietary information. Other than in-bound "shrink-wrap"
end-user licenses and similar generally available commercial binary code end-
user licenses in each case that are not used for software development or in
any software, products or services provided by the Company to customers, all
of the Company Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a license or other grant of a right by a third
party to use its proprietary information is separately identified as such in
SCHEDULE 2.14(B). The Company and its Subsidiaries have all rights in the
Company Intellectual Property necessary to carry out the Company\'s and the
Subsidiaries\' former and current activities and to produce, market, sell and
license all products and services currently under development, including
without limitation (except as noted in SCHEDULE 2.14(B)) rights to make, use,
exclude others from using, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works
based on, translate, distribute (directly and indirectly), transmit, display
and perform publicly, license, rent, lease, assign and sell the Company
Intellectual Property in all geographic locations and fields of use, and to
sublicense any or all such rights to third parties, including the right to
grant further sublicenses.   (c) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(C),
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and have not
breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice that they have
breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any
license, sublicense or other agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary
is a party or otherwise bound relating to any of the Company Intellectual
Property, nor does the Company have knowledge of any event or occurrence that
would reasonably be expected to constitute such a breach, violation or
default (with or without the lapse of time, giving of notice or both). Each
such agreement is in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in default    -22-   thereunder, nor to the
knowledge of the Company is any party obligated to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any such agreement in default thereunder. Following
the Closing Date, except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(C), the Surviving
Corporation will be permitted to exercise all of the Company\'s rights under
such contracts, licenses and agreements to the same extent the Company and
each Subsidiary would have been able to had the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not occurred and without the payment of any additional amounts
or consideration other than fees, royalties or payments which the Company or
any Subsidiary would otherwise have been required to pay had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
2.14(C), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is obligated to provide any
consideration (whether financial or otherwise) to any third party, nor is any
third party otherwise entitled to any consideration, with respect to
any exercise of rights by the Company or any Subsidiary or the
Surviving Corporation, as successor to the Company or any Subsidiary, in the
Company Intellectual Property.   (d) The use of the Company Intellectual
Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently used and as
currently proposed to be used in products and services currently under
development does not infringe any other Person\'s copyright, trade secret
rights, right of privacy, right in personal data, moral right, patent,
trademark, service mark, trade name, firm name, logo, trade dress, mask work
or other intellectual property right, or give rise to any claim of unfair
competition, including without limitation any rights of the University of
California. No funds or facilities of any university were used in the
development of Company Intellectual Property. No claims (i) challenging the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or ownership by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any of the Company Intellectual Property or (ii) to the effect
that the use, reproduction, modification, manufacture,
distribution, licensing, sublicensing, sale, or any other exercise of rights
in any Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
infringes or will infringe on any intellectual property or other proprietary
or personal right of any Person have been asserted against the Company or any
Subsidiary or, to the Company\'s knowledge, are threatened by any Person nor,
to the Company\'s knowledge, does there exist any valid basis for such a
claim. There are no legal or governmental proceedings, including
interference, re-examination, reissue, opposition, nullity, or cancellation
proceedings pending that relate to any of the Company Intellectual Property,
other than review of pending patent and trademark applications, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is aware of any information indicating that
such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any Governmental Entity or
any other Person. All Company Registered Intellectual Property is valid and
subsisting. To the Company\'s knowledge, there is no unauthorized use,
infringement, or misappropriation of any Company Intellectual Property by any
third party, employee or former employee.   (e) Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 2.14(E), the Company and its Subsidiaries have secured from all
parties (including employees) who have created any portion of, or otherwise
have any rights in or to, the Company Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries valid and enforceable written assignments
of any such work, invention, improvement or other rights to the Company and
each Subsidiary and have provided true and complete copies of such
assignments to Parent.     -23-    (f) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
2.14(F), the transactions contemplated under this Agreement will not alter,
impair or otherwise affect any rights of the Company or any Subsidiary in any
Company Intellectual Property.   (g) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
2.14(G), the Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any
Subsidiary is not subject to any source code escrow or similar agreement.

measures to protect the proprietary nature of the Company Intellectual
Property and to maintain in confidence all trade secrets and confidential
information owned or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (i)
To the Company\'s knowledge, the Company Intellectual Property does not
contain any "viruses." For the purposes of this Agreement, "virus" means any
computer code designed to disrupt, disable or harm in any manner the
operation of any software or hardware. To the Company\'s knowledge, none of
the Company Intellectual Property contains any worm, bomb, backdoor, clock,
timer or other disabling device, code, design or routine which causes
the software or any portion thereof to be erased, inoperable or otherwise
incapable of being used, either automatically, with the passage of time or
upon command by any party, other than functionality which allows the Company
to disable a customer\'s service in the event the customer is in violation of
the Company\'s terms of service, including failure to make timely
payment.   (j) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(J), the
Company Intellectual Property does not include any Publicly Available

Company Intellectual Property in a manner that may subject the Company
Intellectual Property, in whole or in part, to all or part of the license
obligations of any Publicly Available Software. No source code licensee of
the Company has received from the Company or distributed to any third party
any combination of Publicly Available Software and Company Intellectual
Property in a manner that may subject the Company Intellectual Property, in
whole or in part, to all or part of the license obligations of any Publicly
Available Software.   (k) None of the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' professional services agreements with their customers, their
agreements with merchants, their agreements with outside consultants for the
performance of professional services on the Company\'s, Subsidiaries\' or
customers\' behalf, nor any agreement or license with any end user or
reseller of the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s products, confers upon any
Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary any ownership right with
respect to any Intellectual Property developed in connection with such
agreement or license.   (l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to,
any Intellectual Property that is or was material Company Intellectual
Property, to any Person.     -24-    2.15 PRODUCT WARRANTIES; DEFECTS;

commitments and all applicable express and implied warranties. To the
Company\'s knowledge, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any

demand against the Company or any Subsidiary giving rise to any liability or
obligation) for replacement or repair thereof or other damages in connection

directors, employees or consultants in connection with the carrying on of the
Company\'s and Subsidiaries\' business as presently conducted or as presently
proposed to be    -34-   conducted, will conflict with or result in a

after the receipt of a California Permit or after the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, the Company
shall submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the
Stockholders for approval and adoption as provided by the DGCL and the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company. Such submission, and
any proxy or consent in connection therewith, shall specify that adoption of
this Agreement shall constitute approval by the Stockholders of: (A) the
escrow and indemnification obligations of the Stockholders set forth in
Article IX hereof and the deposit of the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent
and (B) the appointment of Edward G. Sim as Stockholder Representative, with
the rights and responsibilities set forth in this Agreement. Any materials to
be submitted to the Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their
approval of the Merger and this Agreement (the "SOLICITING MATERIALS") shall
include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
in favor of the Merger, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and a statement that the
Company\'s Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the terms of
the Merger and this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the Stockholders, except as expressly permitted otherwise

this Agreement and to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof and, in any event, within thirty (30) days
following the receipt of the California Permit or the date on which the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act.   (b) The Soliciting Materials shall be subject to review
and reasonable approval by Parent and shall include information regarding
the Company, the terms of the Merger, this Agreement and the Related
Agreements. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the

Company, any Subsidiary or their respective businesses. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause each

such Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, including for this
purpose (A) any consideration to be deposited with the Escrow Agent as part
of the Escrow Amount and (B) the Contingent Consideration, and (iv) the
Company promptly notifies Parent of such exercise or conversion);   (d)

the ordinary course of business in an amount in excess of $100,000 in
the aggregate;   (e) Hire any Employees, or encourage any Employees to
resign from the Company, or promote any Employees or change the employment
status or titles of any of the Employees, except for the hiring of Employees
at non-executive levels in the ordinary course of business at compensation
rates comparable to other Employees at similar levels;   (f) Engage in any
action that could reasonably be expected to produce excessive credit card

backs and/or retrieval requests;   (g) Engage in any action with the intent
to directly or indirectly adversely impact any of the transactions

prior to the date of this Agreement (without regard for disclosures on the
Company Schedules); or   (i) Take, or agree in writing or otherwise to take,
any of the actions described in Sections 5.1(a) through (h) above, or any
other action that would prevent the Company from performing or cause the
Company not to perform its covenants hereunder.    -42-     ARTICLE

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except
as modified by the immediately following sentence. Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Agreement or the Nondisclosure Agreement, the provisions
herein and the Nondisclosure Agreement shall not apply to information related
to the "tax treatment" or "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning

transactions contemplated hereby. For this purpose, "tax structure" is
limited to any facts relevant to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the

(including without limitation applicable securities laws) or by regulatory
authority, prior to the Effective Time no disclosure (whether or not in

by any party hereto (other than disclosures to Stockholders pursuant to
Section 4.4 and other than a press release, Form 8-K and a stockholder
conference call by Parent in connection with the execution of this Agreement)
unless approved by Parent and the Company prior to release, PROVIDED that
such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, (i) in the event that either party is
required by law or regulatory authority to make any such disclosure, such
party shall notify the other party prior to making such disclosure and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to give the other party an opportunity
to comment on such disclosure and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to file this Agreement as an exhibit with the SEC within seven (7)
Business Days of the date hereof (subject to an appropriate confidential
treatment request).   6.4 CONSENTS. The Company shall promptly apply for or
otherwise seek and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and
approvals required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the Merger,
including all consents, waivers, or approvals under any of the Contracts in
order to preserve    -43-   the benefits thereunder for the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise in connection with the Merger. Each of such
necessary consents and approvals is set forth in SCHEDULE 6.4.   6.5 BLUE
SKY LAWS. Parent shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with the
securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable to the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant hereto. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent as may be necessary to comply
with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are
applicable in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant
hereto.   6.6 CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER; FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the
parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate
the transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled
the conditions to closing under this Agreement. Each of the parties to
this Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply promptly with
all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the
Merger and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to any other
party hereto in connection with any such requirements imposed upon such other
party in connection with the Merger. Each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and make (and will cooperate with the other parties in
obtaining or making) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
registration, declaration, or filing with, or an exemption by, any
Governmental Entity, or other third party, required to be obtained or made by
such party or its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of
any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, (i)
Parent shall not be required to modify any of the terms of this Agreement or
the Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in order to
obtain the California Permit and (ii) Parent shall not be required to agree
to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent\'s affiliates of
any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent
or its affiliates or of the Company or its affiliates, or the imposition of
any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, property and stock.
Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for effecting completely the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements.   6.7 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN
MATTERS. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect any
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.   6.8 COMPANY
AFFILIATES. SCHEDULE 6.8 sets forth those Persons who are "affiliates" of the
Company, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment, within the meaning of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act ("RULE 145") (each such   
-44-   Person, a "RULE 145 AFFILIATE"). The Company shall provide Parent
such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for
purposes of reviewing such list. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent
Common Stock and to place the following legend on the certificates evidencing
any Parent Common Stock to be received by such Rule 145 Affiliates pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 APPLIES AND MAY
ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN  CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(d) OR PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION  STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, OR IN  ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO  THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT
FROM  REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."   The
legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend) and Parent shall so instruct its transfer
agent, if the Rule 145 Affiliate delivers to Parent (i) satisfactory written
evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which
case, the substitute certificate shall be issued in the name of
the transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that public sale of the
shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.   6.9
[RESERVED]   6.10 NON-DISCLOSURE, NON-COMPETITION AND DEVELOPMENTS
AGREEMENTS. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
employees listed on SCHEDULE 6.10 to execute Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition
and Developments Agreements in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT C (the
"NON-DISCLOSURE, NON-COMPETITION AND DEVELOPMENTS AGREEMENTS") on or before
the Closing.   6.11 BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) Subject to the other
provisions of this paragraph, Parent agrees that all full-time employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue employment with the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time (the "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES") shall have
the opportunity to participate, or to continue to participate, in employee
benefit plans and arrangements of the Surviving Corporation that provide the
following benefits: medical/dental/vision care, life insurance, disability
income, sick pay, holiday pay and vacation pay, dependent care, severance
benefits and participation in the 401(k) plan (the "PLANS"). Participation of
the Continuing Employees in such Plans shall be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Plans, provided that each Continuing Employee shall
retain credit, for purposes of any service requirements for participation or
vesting in a Plan, for his or her period of service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Each Continuing Employee who, at the Effective Time, was
participating in an employee group health plan maintained by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is terminated by Parent shall not be excluded from
Parent\'s employee group health plan or limited in    -45-   coverage
thereunder by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-
existing condition limitation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) nothing in this
Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit at any time, and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
terminates any Plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the plans or arrangements of the Parent that provide benefits
similar to the benefits provided under any such terminated Plan, as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion. Nothing in this Section 6.11 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Subsidiary of Parent, and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be
"at will" employment, if permitted under applicable law.   (b) The Company
agrees that it will take all necessary actions to cause its 401(k) plan, or
any other 401(k) plan that it sponsors or maintains for the benefit of any of
the Company\'s employees, (i) to be terminated or frozen prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) to be transferred or assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, or (iii) to be merged into an appropriate qualified plan of
Parent, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion.   6.12 EXERCISE OF
OUTSTANDING STANDARD OPTIONS. The Company shall deliver proper notice to each
holder of Standard Options pursuant to Section 12(c) of the Standard Option
Plan informing such holder that (i) the Standard Options will not be assumed
in the Merger and, pursuant to the terms of the Standard Option Plan, the
vesting of all Standard Options will accelerate in full, (ii) such holder has
15 days to notify the Company of its intent to exercise the Standard Options
and to deliver to the Company in cash or by check the exercise price for the
Standard Options to be exercised, and (iii) if not so exercised, the Standard
Options shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.   6.13
CONVERSION OF PREFERRED STOCK. The Company shall solicit the consent of the
holders of Preferred Stock to mandatorily convert all of the Preferred Stock
into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Article Four, Section
B(4)(a)(iii) of the Company\'s Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the "COMPANY CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION") effective as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time.   6.14 TERMINATION OF COMPANY
INVESTOR RIGHTS. The Company shall take such steps as may be necessary to
terminate, as of the Closing, all Company investor rights granted by the
Company to its stockholders and in effect prior to the Closing, including but
not limited to rights of co-sale, voting, registration, first refusal, board
observation or information or operational covenants.     -46-    6.15
NO SOLICITATION.    (a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, the
Company shall not (nor shall the Company permit any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents,
advisors, representatives or Affiliates to), directly or indirectly, take any
of the following actions with any Person other than Parent and its designees:
(i) solicit, encourage, seek, entertain, support, assist, initiate or
participate in any inquiry, negotiations or discussions, or enter into any
agreement, with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any
material part of the business, assets or technologies of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any amount of the Company Capital Stock or capital stock of
any Subsidiary (whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of
assets, purchase of securities, tender offer, license or otherwise, or effect
any such transaction (a "PROPOSAL"), (ii) disclose any information to any
Person concerning the business, technologies or properties of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to their respective
properties, technologies, books or records, not customarily afforded such
access, (iii) assist or cooperate with any Person to make any Proposal, or
(iv) enter into any agreement with any Person with respect to a Proposal. The
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such
negotiations, discussions or agreements (other than with Parent) that are the
subject matter of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above.   (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, at
any time prior to the time the Merger has been approved by the Stockholders,
may, in response to a bona fide written Proposal from a third party that was
not solicited by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents,
advisors, representatives or Affiliates and that involves the acquisition by
the third party of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock (an "ACQUISITION Proposal"): provide information concerning the
Company to, and engage in negotiations and discussions with, the third party
proposing or offering the Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from
the third party so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent for informational
purposes) the terms of which are (without regard to the terms of the
Acquisition Proposal) (x) no less favorable to the Company and (y) no
less restrictive on the third party requesting such information than those
contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement. In the event that (w) the
Acquisition Proposal does not contain a financing contingency, (x) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, (y) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the Acquisition
Proposal would, taking into account all relevant material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, if consummated, result in a
transaction that (1) involves the acquisition by the third party of all or
substantially all of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (2) is
superior, from a financial point of view, to the    -47-   Stockholders
than the Merger and (3) is more favorable generally to the Stockholders than
the Merger (any Acquisition Proposal as to which such determinations have
been made being referred to in this Agreement as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and
(z) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of Section 10.1(g) hereof.   (c) Nothing in this Section 6.15
shall permit the Company to enter into any agreement, orally or in writing,
with respect to a Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement as described above). After the date hereof and
before the Effective Time, neither the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation to the
Stockholders that they approve this Agreement and the Merger or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and prior to
the time this Agreement and the Merger has been approved by the Stockholders,
the Company\'s Board of Directors, as a result of a Superior Proposal, may
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to the
Stockholders that they approve this Agreement and the Merger if and only to
the extent that the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company shall advise Parent in
writing of any Proposal (including the terms thereof and the identity of the
Person making the Proposal) and inquiries with respect to any Proposal within
24 hours of the receipt of such Proposal or inquiry and shall keep
Parent informed on a current basis of the status of any discussions regarding
a Proposal. Nothing herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act.   (d) The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions of this Section 6.15 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction
or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other
security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.15 and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, employee, stockholder,
agent, advisor, representative, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.   6.16
RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of the officers and directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, effective as of the Effective Time.   6.17 HSR ACT. To
the extent applicable, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to file within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause    -48-   any
applicable Stockholder of the Company to file within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice ("DOJ"), Notification and Report Forms (as defined in the HSR Act)
relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act
as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction,
as agreed to by the parties. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts (and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any applicable stockholder of the Company) to promptly (a)
supply the others with any information which reasonably may be required in
order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information
which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or
merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties
may reasonably deem appropriate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be
required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of
Parent\'s affiliates of any shares of capital stock or of any business,
assets or property of Parent or its affiliates or of the Company or its
affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of
any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, property and stock.   6.18 INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS AND
DIRECTORS.   (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent agrees that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity) determined
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES"), to the fullest extent that the Company would have been required or
permitted under its Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in effect on the
date hereof (the "COMPANY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS"), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are asserted after the
Effective Time. In connection therewith, Parent shall also advance expenses
to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under the Company Indemnification Obligations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification. However, the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.18 shall not apply to: (i) any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to Article IX hereof, (ii) any matter that, were it asserted by a
third party against Parent or the Surviving Corporation, would be an
indemnifiable claim pursuant to Article IX hereof, (iii) any claim or matter
that relates to a willful or intentional breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant made by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or made by a Stockholder in connection with
the Voting Agreement, or (iv) any claim made by Bertelsmann A.G. or any of
its Affiliates against any Person.   (b) Any Company Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.18
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or    -49-   investigation, (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, provided

(ii) the Company Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any

MATTERS   7.1 TAX REPRESENTATIONS. The Company hereby represents and
warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such exceptions as are
explicitly disclosed in the Company Schedules:   (a) The Company and each
Subsidiary have timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed
(determined without regard to extensions). The Company and each Subsidiary
have paid all Taxes owed (whether or not shown, or required to be shown, on
Tax Returns). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid
all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts
paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder,
or other third party. All Tax Returns filed by the Company and the
Subsidiaries were complete and correct in all material respects, and such Tax
Returns correctly reflected the facts regarding the income, business, assets,
operations, activities, status and other matters of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and any other information required to be shown thereon. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has participated, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(c), in (i) any "reportable transaction"
within the meaning of Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, (ii) any "confidential corporate tax shelter" within the meaning
of Section 6111 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or (iii)
any "potentially abusive tax shelter" within the meaning of Section 6112 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Company and
each Subsidiary have disclosed on their Tax Returns all positions taken
therein that    -50-   could give rise to a substantial understatement
of Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law). There are no liens for Taxes
upon any of the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s assets, other than Liens for
ad valorem Taxes not yet due and payable.   (b) None of the Tax Returns
filed by the Company or any Subsidiary or Taxes payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary have been the subject of an audit, action, suit, proceeding,
claim, examination, deficiency or assessment by any Governmental Entity, and
no such audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency or
assessment is currently pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, is
contemplated.   (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently
the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has waived any statute of
limitation with respect to any Tax or agreed to any extension of time with

hereof, are set forth in the Company Financial Statements or in SCHEDULE
7.1.   (d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to
any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan (including without limitation

the aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (without regard to the exceptions set

the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to a "substantial risk of
forfeiture" within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code. No portion of the
Merger Consideration is subject to the Tax withholding provisions of Section
3406 of the Code, or of Subchapter A of Chapter 3 of the Code or of any other
provision of law.   (e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to
or member of any joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or
other arrangement or contract which could be treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever
filed a consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code, relating to
collapsible corporations, and Section 341(f)(2) does not apply to any of the
Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s assets. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is, or has been, a U.S. real property holding company (as defined
in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
owns an interest in real property in any jurisdiction in which a Tax is
imposed, or the value of the interest reassessed, on the transfer of an
interest in real property and which treats the transfer of an interest in an
entity that owns an interest in real property as a transfer of the interest
in real property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever been either
a "controlled corporation" or a "distributing corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) with respect to a transaction
that was described in, or intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction
pursuant to Section 355 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has net operating losses or other tax attributes presently subject to
limitation under Sections 382, 383 or 384 of the Code, or the
federal consolidated return regulations (other than limitations imposed as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has made or agreed to make any adjustment under
Section 481(a) of the    -51-   Code (or any corresponding provision of

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has participated in an international boycott as defined in
Section 999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever (i)

under any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign Tax law.

investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code or a
"controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957 of the
Code.   (f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
sharing agreement or similar arrangement (including, but not limited to,
an indemnification agreement or arrangement). Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has ever been a member of a group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return or a combined, consolidated, unitary or other
affiliated group Tax Return for state, local or foreign Tax purposes (other
than a group the common parent of which is the Company), and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than the Company) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law), or as a
transferee or successor, or by contract, or otherwise.   (g) The unpaid
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the Balance Sheet
Date, exceed the reserve for actual Taxes (as opposed to any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) as shown on the Company Balance Sheet, and will not exceed such
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the reasonable past custom and practice of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in filing Tax Returns. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary will incur any liability for Taxes from the Balance Sheet
Date through the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with reasonable past practice.   (h) SCHEDULE 7.1 lists all
jurisdictions (whether foreign or domestic) to which any Tax is properly
payable by the Company or any Subsidiary. No claim has ever been made by a
Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Subsidiary does not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be subject to
Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has, or has
ever had, a permanent establishment or other taxable presence in any foreign
country, as determined pursuant to applicable foreign law and any applicable
Tax treaty or convention between the United States and such foreign
country.   (i) The Company has delivered to Parent correct and
complete copies of all income Tax Returns, examination reports, and

Company and its Subsidiaries since January 1, 1998.     -52-    (j)
Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change in any method of
Tax accounting or any making of a Tax election or change of an existing

nor any Subsidiary shall make or change any material election in respect of
Taxes, adopt or change any accounting method in respect of Taxes, enter into

REORGANIZATION. After the Closing Date, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, together with the LLC Merger, to

together with the LLC Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no party is making any assurances
or representations as to the status of the Merger, together with the LLC
Merger, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and no opinion of counsel with respect to such status has been or will be
obtained except as set forth in Section 4.3(g).   (f) PARACHUTE PAYMENTS.
The Company will take all action that is necessary to ensure that no

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will result, separately
or in the aggregate, in the payment of an "excess parachute payment" within

(the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any and all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, interest and penalties, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses, and expenses of investigation and
defense (hereinafter individually a "LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES";
provided that "LOSSES" shall not include any amounts actually received by the
Company in respect of insurance) incurred or suffered by any such Indemnified
Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to or in
connection with (i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth herein or in any certificate, document or other instrument
delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement to be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the

any Stockholder claims relating to or arising out of the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for claims arising
out of or related to disputing a claim to indemnification made by an
Indemnified Party hereunder. The Escrow Amount shall be available to
reimburse the Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.2.   9.3 LIMITATIONS. The sole
and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for money damages with
respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be to make claims
against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. No claims
shall be made by any Indemnified Party against the Escrow Amount pursuant to
Section 9.2(i) hereof unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for
which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.2(i) exceed $300,000 (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT"), at which time the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses
(including all Losses included within the Threshold Amount). Parent, Merger
Sub, the LLC and the Indemnified Parties agree that the sole and exclusive
remedy for money damages for any matters relating to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant
hereto shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this Article
IX. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit (i) any right or remedy for fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or misconduct or (ii) any
equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance.   9.4 PROCEDURES.   (a) Promptly after the discovery of any
Loss or Losses by any Indemnified Party, but excluding any claim by a third
party described in Section 9.4(c) hereof, which might give rise to
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a certificate (the "CLAIM CERTIFICATE"), which
Claim Certificate shall:   (i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid
or properly accrued Losses, or anticipates that it will incur liability for
Losses, for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement; and   (ii) specify in reasonable detail, to the
extent available, each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default,
breach of warranty    -59-   or breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder.   (b) In case the
Stockholder Representative shall object to the indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim
Certificate, the Stockholder Representative shall, within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of such Claim Certificate,
deliver to the Indemnified Party a written notice to such effect and the
Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party shall, within
the thirty-day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified
Party of such written objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which
the Stockholder Representative shall have so objected. If the Indemnified
Party and the Stockholder Representative shall succeed in reaching agreement
with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth
such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its
available remedies for resolving its claim for indemnification.   (c)
Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim against any
Indemnified Party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") that, in the good faith judgment of
such Indemnified Party, may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified
Party of Losses for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written notice describing
in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholder
Representative shall relieve the Stockholders of any liability or obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Stockholders have been prejudiced
thereby, and then only to such extent. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any such Third Party
Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Stockholders shall not be liable to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any such Third Party
Claim effected without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld. If any such
action or claim is settled with the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such

Representative shall have access to relevant information about the Company
and the reasonable assistance of the Company\'s officers and employees for

received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of,
the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to

time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Stockholder; and each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be

(a) by written consent duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub;   (b) by either Parent or the Company if:
(i) the Closing Date has not occurred by March 15, 2004, unless the
Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California denies the California

case, the "TERMINATION DATE"); PROVIDED that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this clause 10.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party

resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before the
Termination Date and such action or failure constitutes a breach of this
Agreement; (ii) there shall be a final nonappealable order of a Governmental
Entity in effect preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall
be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or
deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make
consummation of the Merger illegal;   (c) by Parent if there shall have been
any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental
Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent\'s or the Company\'s ownership or
operation of any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent
or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the Merger, any
portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent;   (d) by Parent
if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and

agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company and as a
result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b),
as the case may be, would not then be satisfied;   (e) by Parent, if the
Company or its Board of Directors (A) fails to recommend or publicly proposes
not to recommend the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger
by the Stockholders or breaches Section 4.4(a) or (B) shall have withdrawn,
modified or amended in any respect adverse to Parent its recommendation of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Stockholders (or publicly proposes to do so) or failed to reconfirm its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within three Business Days
after a written request by Parent to do so;   (f) by the Company if it is
not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has
been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement on    -63-   the part of Parent or Merger
Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a)
or 8.2(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied;   (g) by the
Company if (A) the Company is not in breach of Section 4.4 or 6.15 hereof,
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written
agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and
the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to enter into such an
agreement attaching the most current version of such agreement to such
notice, (C) Parent does not make, within five Business Days of receipt of the
Company\'s written notification of its intention to enter into a binding
agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, is at least as favorable to
the Stockholders as the Superior Proposal (taking into account all financial
and strategic considerations and other relevant factors), (D) concurrent with
such termination the Company pays to Parent in immediately available funds
the fees and expenses required to be paid pursuant to Section 10.2(b) and
(E) concurrently with such termination the Company enters into a binding
written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. The Company agrees
(1) that it will not enter into a binding agreement referred to in clause (B)
above until at least the sixth Business Day after it has provided the notice
to Parent required thereby and (2) to notify Parent promptly if its intention
to enter into a written agreement referred to in its notification shall
change at any time after giving such notification.   Where action is taken
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, it shall be sufficient
for such action to be authorized by the Board of Directors (as applicable) of
the party taking such action.   10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.    (a) Except
as set forth in this Section 10.2, any termination of this Agreement under
Section 10.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written
notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in Sections
6.2 and 6.3, this Section 10.2, Section 10.3 and Article XI, each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.   (b) In the event
that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(e),
(B) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(g) or (C) as a result of the
Company\'s failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Merger prior to the Termination Date or procure the approval of the
Stockholders in accordance with Section 4.4, then the Company shall promptly,
but in no event later than the earlier of the date of such termination or
date of entrance into an agreement concerning a Superior Proposal   
-64-   or such earlier time as required by this Agreement pay to Parent a
cash termination fee of $9 million payable by wire transfer of same day funds
(the "TERMINATION FEE").   (c) In the event that (A) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) after the Company receives a
Proposal and (B) within 12 months of such termination the Company enters into
an agreement concerning any Proposal, the Company shall at the time of
entering into such agreement pay to Parent the Termination Fee payable by
wire transfer of same day funds.   (d) The Company and Parent each
acknowledge that the agreements contained in Sections 10.2 (b) and (c) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fees
set forth in this Section 10.2, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement
on the amounts owed at the prime rate of the Bank of America in effect from
time to time during such period plus two percent. Provided that the Company
has not breached its obligations pursuant to Sections 4.4 and 6.15, the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.2(b) or (c) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy that may be available in law or equity to
Parent or Merger Sub for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(e)(B) or 10.1(g).   10.3 AMENDMENT. Except as is otherwise
required by applicable law, prior to the Closing this Agreement may be

1.6(f) and SCHEDULE 1.6(F), the Contingent Consideration Representative shall
keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed and consider in good
faith advice given by the Stockholder Representative.   10.4 EXTENSION;

the one hand, and the Company, on the other, may, to the extent legally

and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of

AGREEMENT   VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") between Citrix Systems,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned stockholder
(the "Stockholder") of Expertcity.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the Stockholder owns of record and/or holds (a)
shares of the Company\'s capital stock and (b) stock options, convertible
securities or warrants (whether or not vested) to acquire shares of the
Company\'s capital stock, in each case in that number and class of shares of
the Company\'s capital stock appearing on SCHEDULE A hereto (such options,
convertible securities, warrants and/or shares of the Company\'s capital
stock, together with any other such options, convertible securities, warrants
and/or shares of capital stock of the Company acquired by such Stockholder
after the date hereof and during the term of this Agreement, being
collectively referred to herein as the "Subject Shares");   WHEREAS, upon
the fulfillment of the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of
Merger by and among Parent, EAC Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger Sub"), and the Company dated
the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), the Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the Company (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, the Stockholder believes
that the terms of the Merger and the Merger Agreement are fair and that it is
in his, her or its best interest as a stockholder of the Company that the
Merger be consummated;   WHEREAS, Parent has advised the Company that Parent
is not prepared to execute the Merger Agreement unless Parent believes that
it is reasonably likely that the Merger will be consummated, and therefore
Parent is requiring that certain stockholders undertake in advance to vote
their shares in favor of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, for these reasons, in
order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger and in consideration of the
execution of the Merger Agreement by Parent and to enhance the likelihood
that the Merger will be consummated, the Stockholder, solely in his, her or
its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, agrees to vote the Subject
Shares so as to facilitate consummation of the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the promises and the covenants and agreements set forth
below, the parties agree as follows:  1. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this
Agreement, terms not defined herein but used herein and defined in the Merger
Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise.    A-1    2. TRANSFER OF
SHARES. Subject to Section 7 hereof, the Stockholder agrees that, during the
term of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not cause or permit
any Transfer (as defined below) of any of the Subject Shares or enter into
any agreement, option or arrangement with respect to a Transfer. The
Stockholder agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder
shall not deposit (or permit the deposit of) any Subject Shares in a voting
trust or grant any proxy or enter into any voting agreement or similar
agreement with respect to any of the Subject Shares or in any way grant any
other Person any right whatsoever with respect to the voting or disposition
of the Subject Shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a Person shall be
deemed to have effected a "Transfer" of a security if such Person directly or
indirectly: (i) sells, pledges, encumbers, grants an option with respect to,
transfers or disposes of such security or any interest in such security; or
(ii) enters into an agreement or commitment providing for the sale of, pledge
of, encumbrance of, grant of an option with respect to, transfer of or
disposition of such security or any interest therein.  3. AGREEMENT TO VOTE
SHARES. The Stockholder agrees that at any meeting of stockholders of the
Company or at any adjournment thereof, in any action by written consent or in
any other circumstances upon which the Stockholder\'s vote, consent or other
approval is sought, the Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) all of
the Subject Shares (i) in favor of the Merger and each of the terms of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions and other agreements reflected therein,
(ii) against any proposal, amendment or agreement that would in any manner
impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Merger Agreement, the Merger, this
Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of capital
stock of the Company, and (iii) against any Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Stockholder
from exercising full power and authority to vote the Subject Shares in
Stockholder\'s sole discretion for or against any proposal submitted to a
vote or action by written consent of the Company\'s stockholders to approve
any payment which would, in the absence of such approval, constitute a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code.  4. DIRECTOR MATTERS
EXCLUDED. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that no provision of
this Agreement shall limit or otherwise restrict Stockholder with respect to
any vote that Stockholder may make as a director of the Company with respect
to a matter presented to the Company\'s Board of Directors.  5. IRREVOCABLE
PROXY. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder has
executed and delivered to Parent an irrevocable proxy in the form attached

extent permissible by law, with respect to the Subject Shares.  6.

to authorize this Agreement and the Proxy, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or to comply with the provisions hereof or of the Proxy.
Each of this Agreement and the Proxy has been duly executed and delivered by
the Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Stockholder and is enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its
terms. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Proxy, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof and thereof do not and will not conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws, partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement (or
similar organizational documents) of the Stockholder, if applicable, or (ii)

any such transferee shall, as a condition to such Transfer, execute and
deliver to Parent a counterpart signature page to this Agreement whereby such
transferee shall become bound to the provisions hereof, (iii) Stockholder may
Transfer Subject Shares to no more than three (3) transferees and (iv) each
transferee must acquire at least twenty percent (20%) of the maximum number
of Subject Shares that are at any time subject to this Agreement.    
A-3   8. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to
occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms, (ii) the Effective Time and (iii) an amendment of the Merger Agreement
which decreases the Merger Consideration or delays the timing of payment of
the Merger Consideration. In the event of the termination of this Agreement,
this Agreement and the Proxy shall forthwith become null and void, there
shall be no liability on the part of any of the parties, and all rights and
obligations of each party hereto shall cease; provided, however, that no such
termination of this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from any
liability for any breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to
termination.  9. FURTHER COVENANT AND ASSURANCES. The Stockholder shall not
(and (x) if the Stockholder is a corporation, the Stockholder\'s board of
directors and executive officers shall not authorize, instruct, direct or
knowingly allow or (y) if the Stockholder is not a corporation, the

employees, investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or representatives
to) (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the
submission of any Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Proposal. The Stockholder will, from time to time,
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional
or further consents, documents and other instruments as Parent may reasonably
request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  10. SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS
AND TRANSFEREES BOUND. Without limiting Section 2 hereof in any way, the
Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall
attach to the Subject Shares from the date hereof through the termination of
this Agreement and shall be binding upon any Person to which legal or
beneficial ownership of the Subject Shares shall pass, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, including the Stockholder\'s heirs,
guardians, administrators or successors, and the Stockholder further agrees
to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Any shares of the
Company\'s capital stock or any stock options, convertible securities, or
warrants (whether or not vested) to acquire shares of the Company\'s capital
stock received by the Stockholder in connection with any stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other
change in the capital structure of the Company affecting the capital stock of
the Company shall be Subject Shares, and this Agreement and the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder
shall attach to any such additional Subject Shares.  11. DEPOSIT. The
Stockholder shall cause a counterpart of this Agreement to be deposited with
the Company at its principal place of business or registered office where it
shall be subject to the same right of examination by a stockholder of the
Company, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of
the Company.  12. REMEDIES. The Stockholder acknowledges that money damages
would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by it, and that any such breach would cause Parent irreparable
harm. Accordingly, the    A-4   Stockholder agrees that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Parent, in addition to any
other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled to seek
immediate equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific
performance, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction.  13. SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in such
jurisdiction, or the validity or enforceability of any provision of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENT. This
Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered
or supplemented except by means of a written instrument executed and
delivered by the parties hereto.  15. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof. The Stockholder agrees that process
may be served upon him, her or it in any manner authorized by the laws of the
State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and
such process.  16. COUNTERPARTS. For the convenience of the parties, this
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.   [Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank]

equity interests in Expertcity through the Merger, including the substantial
number of shares of common stock that I hold;   WHEREAS, as part of the
Merger, and as a direct result of the sale of my shares of Expertcity common
stock, I will receive a substantial portion of the Merger consideration;  
WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Citrix entering into the
Merger Agreement and consummating the Merger, and in consideration of the
covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in order to
provide Citrix with the full benefits of the Merger, I have agreed to execute
and deliver this Agreement because I wish to induce Expertcity and Citrix to
consummate the Merger, which would not occur absent my executing this
Agreement;     C-1    WHEREAS, this Agreement shall be effective at the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and   WHEREAS, the
execution and delivery by me of this Agreement is a condition precedent to
Citrix\'s willingness to consummate the Merger Agreement.  NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration for Citrix\'s purchase of my Expertcity stock, and, in
addition, in consideration for my continued employment by Company, subject to
the policies, procedures and practices that Company may establish from time
to time, the compensation I shall receive from Company during my employment,
and as a material inducement for the Company to disclose to me in connection
with its business certain confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret
information described below, I hereby agree:  1. PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES
During my employment with Company, I will devote  my full time, attention,
energies, skills and efforts to the  performance of any job duties and
responsibilities assigned to me by  Company. I shall not engage in any other
business activity, whether or  not such business activity is pursued for
gain, profit, or other  pecuniary advantage, which may tend to (i) interfere
with the  performance of any job duties and responsibilities assigned to me
by  Company, (ii) create a conflict of interest, or (iii) be competitive 
with the business activities, products or services of Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may participate in the  activities
set forth in Exhibit C provided that Executive\'s performance  thereof does
not violate (a) any term of this or any other Agreement  between Executive
and Expertcity or Citrix or (b) any of Company\'s  policies.  2.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE I understand that in the course of  my
employment with Company, I will have access to, be entrusted or  become
acquainted with and may acquire knowledge of various  confidential, trade
secret and/or proprietary information of Company  and/or its clients and
customers (all of which is hereinafter referred  to as "Confidential Business
Information"). By way of illustration  only, and not limitation, Confidential
Business Information may include  information regarding (a) marketing
strategies, programs, plans and  methods; (b) pricing policies, product
strategies, and methods of  operation and other business methods; (c)
customer lists, customer  identification, customer prospects, prospective
leads or target  accounts, and other basic customer information; (d)
technical data,  specifications, designs, concepts, discoveries,
improvements, product  plans, research and development information, formulas,
compilations,  programs, methods, techniques, inventions, devices, systems,
and  techniques; (e) expansion plans, management policies and other
business  policies and strategies, (f) business forecasts, financial data,
costs,  sales and revenue reports, and any analyses not publicly disclosed;
(g)  employment lists, salary information and other information regarding 
employees, agents, representatives, consultants and independent  contractors
of Company; (h) internally developed computer programs and  software,
computer source codes, integrated computer systems and data,  and internal
procedures and forms; (i) lists of Company\'s vendors and    C-2   
suppliers and terms of service contracts; (j) any Confidential Business 
Information of any third party which Company is obligated to keep 
confidential and (k) other information which enables Company to compete 
successfully.   I hereby agree not to use any of the Confidential Business 
Information for any purpose other than in the course and scope of my 
employment with Company and for the exclusive benefit of Company.  Except for
disclosure in the course and scope of my employment with  Company and on
behalf of Company, I will not at any time, either during  or after my
employment by Company, directly or indirectly, use,  publish, disseminate,
copy, distribute or otherwise disclose any  Confidential Business Information
to any other person or entity.   I agree to take all steps necessary, and
all steps requested  by Company, to ensure that the Confidential Business
Information is  kept secret and confidential and for the sole use and benefit
of  Company and to comply with all applicable policies and procedures of 
Company regarding the storage and security of all Confidential Business 
Information, whether in hard copy form or stored on computer disks or  other
electronic media. I also acknowledge that the Confidential  Business
Information is and has been the subject of efforts that are  reasonable under
the circumstances to maintain its confidentiality.   I acknowledge and agree
that the Confidential Business  Information is a special and unique asset of
Company and derives  independent economic value, actual or potential, from
not being  generally known by the public or by other persons or entities who
can  obtain economic value from its disclosure. I further agree that the 
disclosure of any Confidential Business Information to competitors of 
Company both during and after my employment with Company, or use of any 
Confidential Business Information for my own benefit would constitute 
misappropriation of the Confidential Business Information.   I acknowledge
that all documents and materials that I prepare,  and Confidential Business
Information that I may have access to, may be  given or entrusted to me or
that I may acquire knowledge of in the  course of my employment by Company,
are and shall remain the sole  property of Company. In the event that my
employment with Company  terminates for any reason, or upon demand by
Company, I agree to (i)  immediately return or turn over to Company all
Confidential Business  Information (and any copies thereof) in my possession,
custody or  control, as well as any documents, notes or other work product, 
information and other property in my possession, custody or control  which is
in any way connected with or derived from my services to, or  affiliation
with, Company, and (ii) sign and return to Company a copy  of the
"Termination Certificate" attached hereto as Exhibit "A."  3. NON-
SOLICITATION OF CLIENTS During my employment with Company and for a  period
of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment  with
Company for any reason, I agree not to, either individually or  jointly,
directly or indirectly, either as an employee, employer,  operator, agent,
independent contractor, owner, consultant, partner,  investor or otherwise,
provide to any actual or prospective client of  Company serviced by me or
with whom I otherwise have dealt while  employed by Company any products or
services that compete with the    C-3    products and services offered,
planned to be offered and/or under  development by Company during the term of
my employment and/or at the  time of my employment termination.   I agree
that during my employment with Company and for a  period of twelve (12)
months following the termination of my employment  with Company for any
reason, I will not, directly or indirectly, call  upon or solicit, either for
myself or for any other person or entity,  any clients or accounts of Company
for the purpose of competing,  whether directly or indirectly, nor shall I
make known to any other  person or entity, either directly or indirectly, the
names and  addresses of and other pertinent information relating to any
such  clients or accounts, or any Confidential Business Information
relating  to any of them.   I agree that this covenant not to solicit
clients is  reasonable and necessary to protect Company\'s legitimate
business  interests, including, without limitation, the confidential business
or  professional information and trade secrets of Company, the substantial 
relationships between Company and its clients, and the goodwill of  Company.
I also agree that the 12-month duration of this covenant not  to solicit
clients is reasonable. I further agree that the enforcement  of this covenant
not to solicit clients, whether by injunctive relief,  damages, or otherwise,
is in no way contrary to the public health,  safety and welfare.  4. NON-
SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES I agree that during my employment with  Company and
for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of  my employment
with Company for any reason, I will not, directly or  indirectly, myself or
through any individual or entity, (i) solicit,  induce or attempt to induce
away, or aid, assist or abet any other  person or entity in soliciting,
inducing or attempting to induce away  from his/her employment or association
with Company any officer,  director, employee, independent contractor,
consultant, agent, or other  personnel or representative of Company, or (ii)
otherwise disrupt,  impair, damage or interfere with any relationship between
Company and  any of its officers, directors, employees, independent
contractors,  consultants, agents, or other personnel or representatives.  
In addition, I agree that during my employment with Company  and for a period
of six (6) months after the termination of my  employment with Company for
any reason, I will not, directly, myself,  hire, retain, or engage, or aid,
assist or abet any other person or  entity in hiring, retaining or engaging,
any current officer, director,  employee, independent contractor, consultant,
agent, or other personnel  or representative of Company, or any such person
whose relationship  with Company terminated either six months prior to or six
months after  my relationship with Company terminated.   I agree that these
covenants are reasonable and necessary to  protect Company\'s legitimate
business interests, including, without  limitation, the confidential business
or professional information and  trade secrets of Company, the substantial
relationships between Company  and its officers, directors, employees,
independent contractors,  consultants, agents, and other personnel or
representatives. I also    C-4    agree that the 12-month duration of
this covenant not to solicit or  six-month duration of this covenant not to
hire employees is  reasonable. I further agree that the enforcement of this
covenant not  to solicit or hire employees, whether by injunctive relief,
damages, or  otherwise, is in no way contrary to the public policy.  5.
NON-COMPETITION In addition, I agree that during my employment with  Company
and for a period of four (4) years after the Merger\'s Effective  Date or two
(2) years after the termination of my employment with  Company for any
reason, whichever period is longer, I will not,  anywhere in the world,
individually or jointly, directly or indirectly,  whether as a partner,
owner, investor, joint venturer, officer,  director, employer, employee,
operator, consultant, agent, independent  contractor, stockholder or
otherwise, engage in or be related to any  business or enterprise in
competition with the business of Company.   I agree that this covenant not
to compete is reasonable and  necessary to protect Company\'s legitimate
business interests,  including, without limitation, the confidential and
professional  information and trade secrets of Company, the substantial
relationships  between Company and its customers and clients, and the
goodwill of  Company. Additionally, I acknowledge and agree that Company
provides  its products and services on a worldwide basis and, thus, the 
geographical limitation of this covenant not to compete also is  reasonable.
I further agree that the enforcement of this covenant not  to compete,
whether by injunctive relief, damages, or otherwise, is in  no way contrary
to the public policy.   The ownership by me of not more than one percent of
the shares  of stock of any corporation having a class of equity registered
under  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or a foreign country
equivalent,  shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to violate the
prohibitions  against competition in this Section 5.  6. OTHER OBLIGATIONS
I represent and warrant to Company that I am not  under any contract,
agreement or restrictive covenant, and have not  previously executed any
documents whatsoever with any other person,  firm, association, or
corporation, that will, in any manner, prevent me  from performing any of the
job duties and responsibilities that may be  assigned to me from time to time
by Company.   I also represent and warrant that I will not bring and have 
not brought with me to Company and that I will not use in the course  and
scope of my employment with Company any confidential, proprietary  and/or
trade secret materials, documents or information that I obtained  from a
former employer or other individual or entity, without the  express written
authorization of the pertinent former employer or other  individual or
entity. I further represent and warrant that, during my  employment with
Company, I will not breach any obligation or duty to  maintain confidential
and not to disclose or use that I may owe to any  former employer or other
individual or entity, and I agree to fulfill  and comply with any and all
such obligations and duties during my  employment by Company.  7.
DISCLOSURE AND ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS If at any time during the term  of my
employment by Company, I (either alone or with others) made,    C-5   
conceived, discovered, or reduced to practice, or make, conceive,  discover
or reduce to practice any invention, modification, discovery,  design,
development, improvement, process, software program, work of  authorship,
documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, secret  or intellectual
property right whatsoever or any interest therein  (whether or not patentable
or registrable under copyright or similar  statutes or subject to analogous
protection) (hereinafter called  "Developments") that (i) related or relate
to the business of Company  or any of the products or services being
developed, manufactured or  sold by Company, or which may be used in relation
therewith; (ii)  resulted or result, directly or indirectly, from tasks,
duties and/or  responsibilities assigned to me by Company; or (iii) resulted
or  result, directly or indirectly, from the use of premises or personal 
property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted  for by
Company, such Developments and the benefits thereof shall be  considered work
made for hire and shall immediately become the sole and  absolute property of
Company and its assigns. I agree that I have  disclosed, and shall
immediately disclose, to Company (or any persons  designated by it) each of
such Developments and agree to immediately  communicate to Company, without
cost or delay, and without publishing  the same, all available information
relating thereto (with all  necessary plans and models).   If any of the
Developments may not, by operation of law or  otherwise, be considered work
made for hire by me for Company, or if  ownership of all right, title, and
interest of the intellectual  property rights therein shall not otherwise
vest exclusively in  Company, I hereby assign to Company, and upon the future
creation  thereof automatically assign to Company, without further
consideration,  the ownership of all such Developments. I understand and
agree that  Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name 
copyrights, patents, registrations, and any other protection available  in
the Developments. Upon disclosure of each of such Developments to  Company, I
agree during the term of my employment and at any time  thereafter, at the
request and cost of Company, to sign, execute, make  and do all such deeds,
documents, acts and things as Company may  reasonably require to perfect and
protect all interests therein.   NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO
CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE 2870 AND  SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPED
ENTIRELY ON MY OWN TIME  WITHOUT USING COMPANY\'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES,
FACILITIES, OR TRADE  SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE DEVELOPMENTS THAT
EITHER: (I)  RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF
THE  DEVELOPMENT TO COMPANY\'S BUSINESS, OR ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRABLY 
ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF COMPANY; OR (II) RESULT FROM ANY  WORK
PERFORMED BY ME FOR COMPANY.   In the event Company is unable, after
reasonable effort, to  secure my signature on any letters patent, copyright
or other analogous  protection relating to any Developments, whether because
of my physical  or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, I
hereby  irrevocably designate and appoint Company and its duly authorized 
officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on  my
behalf and stead to execute and file any such application(s) and to   
C-6    do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution
and  issuance of letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection 
relating to any Developments with the same legal force and effect as if 
executed by me.   I represent that the Developments, if any, identified in
the  Schedule of Separate Works attached hereto as Exhibit "B", comprise
all  the Developments which I have made or conceived PRIOR to my employment 
by Company and any of its predecessors. Any such Developments listed in 
Exhibit B are excluded from and shall not be assigned to Company  pursuant to
this Agreement. I understand that it is only necessary to  list in Exhibit B
the title and purpose of such Developments but not  details thereof. I also
agree not to include, in whole or in part, any  Developments listed in
Exhibit B in the materials I prepare for Company  or otherwise use, in whole
or in part, any Developments listed in  Exhibit B in connection with my
employment by Company unless and until  such items are licensed or assigned
to Company under separate written  agreement.  8. NOTICE TO FUTURE
EMPLOYERS AND OF FUTURE EMPLOYMENT I agree and  acknowledge that during my
employment with Company and for the  effective period of the non-competition
provision set forth in Section  5, I will inform each prospective new
employer I may have, prior to  accepting employment, of the existence of this
Agreement, and I shall  provide each prospective employer with a copy of this
Agreement. I also  agree and acknowledge that Company has the right to
independently  contact any potential or actual future employer of mine to
notify the  future employer of my obligations under this Agreement and
provide such  future employer with a copy of this Agreement. Company shall
also be  entitled to notify such actual or potential future employer of 
Company\'s understanding of the requirements of this Agreement and what 
steps, if any, Company intends to take to insure compliance with or 
enforcement of this Agreement.  9. ENFORCEMENT I understand that if I
violate the terms of this Agreement  while I am employed by Company, I will
be subject to disciplinary  action up to and including discharge from my
employment. I further  agree and acknowledge that the covenants and
undertakings contained in  this Agreement relate to matters that are of a
special, unique and  extraordinary character and that a violation or breach
of any of the  restrictive covenants in this Agreement will cause irreparable
harm to  Company, the full amount of which will be impossible to estimate
or  determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. For that reason, 
I agree that, in addition to any other remedies, Company will be  entitled to
an injunction, restraining order, writ of mandamus or other  equitable relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce  this Agreement in the
event of an actual, potential or threatened  breach of the restrictive
covenants in this Agreement. Without regard  to whether Company seeks or is
granted any such equitable relief,  Company will not be prejudiced in its
right to seek and be awarded  damages for any breach of any restrictive
covenant in this Agreement. I  understand that the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement  are cumulative and will be in addition to any
rights and remedies  otherwise available to Company under applicable law. I
also agree that  the existence of any claim or cause of action that I may
have against  Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise,
shall not  constitute a valid defense to the enforcement of the restrictive 
covenants contained in this Agreement.    C-7    I further agree and
acknowledge that should legal proceedings  be initiated by Company to enforce
the restrictive covenants contained  in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this
Agreement, the commencement of the  duration of said covenants, as the case
may be, will commence on the  date of the entry of an order granting Company
injunctive, monetary or  other relief from my actual or threatened breach of
said covenants and  will remain in effect for the next succeeding six months,
12 months or  time period as specified in Section 5, as the case may be. I 
acknowledge that the purpose and effect of the covenants contained in 
Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Agreement would be frustrated by measuring  the
duration of said covenants from the termination of this Agreement  where I
fail to honor the covenants contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of  this
Agreement until directed to do so by court order.  10. AMENDMENT OR
MODIFICATION This Agreement may not be changed or amended  except in writing
signed by the parties.  11. SUCCESSORS Expertcity may assign the rights and
benefits given to it in  this Agreement, to which I expressly agree and this
Agreement shall  survive any sale of assets, merger, consolidation, or other
change in  corporate structure. Without limiting the foregoing, I expressly 
acknowledge and agree that Expertcity currently intends to merge with  and
into the LLC and further agree that Expertcity shall assign the  rights and
benefits given to it in this Agreement to the LLC and this  Agreement shall
survive any such assignment. My obligations under this  Agreement shall
survive the termination of my employment regardless of  the manner of such
termination and shall be binding upon my heirs,  executors, administrators
and legal representatives. Company also may  assign its rights and benefits
in this Agreement.  12. WAIVER The waiver by any party of any breach of any
provision of this  Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach  of such provision or the breach of any other provision
contained in  this Agreement.  13. CHOICE OF LAW I understand that this
Agreement will be governed by and  construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of  California.  14. SEPARATE COVENANTS This
Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a  series of separate covenants by
me, one for each line of business  carried on by the Company. The parties
expressly agree that the  character, duration and geographical scope of this
Agreement,  including, but not limited to, the covenants in Section 5, are 
reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date upon 
which this Agreement has been executed. However, should a court of  competent
jurisdiction nonetheless determine at a later date that the  character,
duration or geographical scope of this Agreement, including,  but not limited
to, the covenants in Section 5, are unreasonable in  light of the
circumstances as they then exist, then it is my intention  and agreement that
this Agreement shall be construed by the court in  such a manner as to impose
only those restrictions on my conduct that  are reasonable in light of the
circumstances as they then exist and as  are necessary to assure the Company
of the intended benefit of this  Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. If, in any    C-8    judicial proceeding, a court shall
refuse to enforce all of the  separate covenants deemed included herein
because, taken together they  are more extensive than necessary to assure the
Company of the intended  benefit of this Agreement, it is expressly
understood and agreed  between the parties hereto that those of such
covenants (or portions  thereof), which, if eliminated, would permit the
remaining separate  covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced in such
proceeding  shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed eliminated
from  the provisions hereof.  15. SEVERABILITY Without limiting the
applicability of Section 14, it is  the desire and intent of the parties that
the provisions of this  Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the  laws and public policies applied in California.
Accordingly, if any  particular provision or portion of this Agreement shall
be determined  by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable as  written, it is the intent and desire of the parties that
the court  shall modify the language of such provision or portion of this 
agreement to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If  no
such modification by the court is possible, this Agreement shall be  deemed
amended to delete therefrom only the provision or portion thus  determined to
be invalid or unenforceable. Such modification or  deletion is to apply only
with respect to the operation of such  provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such court  determination is made.  16. NO EMPLOYMENT
CONTRACT FOR A SPECIFIC TERM Nothing in this Agreement  will be construed as
giving rise to any contract of employment or  guarantee of employment for any
fixed period of time. Absent a separate  written employment contract for a
specific term signed by the parties,  I understand that my employment by
Company is for an indefinite period  of time, is at-will and therefore may be
terminated by either me or  Company or the Company at any time, for any or no
reason, with or  without prior notice.  17. HEADINGS Any section or
paragraph title or caption contained in this  Agreement is for convenience
only, and in no way defines, limits or  describes the scope or intent of this
Agreement or any of the  provisions hereof.  18. CONSTRUCTION This
Agreement shall not be construed against any party by  reason of the fact
that the party may be responsible for the drafting  of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.  19. KNOWLEDGE OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES I have carefully
reviewed and completely  read all of the provisions of this Agreement and
understand and have  been advised that I may consult with counsel of my
choice for any  explanation of my rights, duties, obligations and
responsibilities  under this Agreement, should I so desire. I acknowledge
that I enter  into this Agreement of my own free will.     C-9   20.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Agreement sets forth the complete, sole and  entire
agreement between the parties on the subject matter herein and  supersedes
any and all other agreements, negotiations, discussions,  proposals, or
understandings, whether oral or written, previously  entered into, discussed
or considered by the parties; provided,  however, that for the period from
the start of my Expertcity.com, Inc.  employment up to and until the date on
which I execute this Agreement  (the "pre-Citrix term"), the General
Employment Terms and Conditions,  Invention Assignment Agreement and any
other confidentiality and/or  invention assignment provision and agreement,
all of which I executed  as a condition of my Expertcity employment, remain
in full force and  effect for the pre-Citrix term. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, this  Agreement does not supersede the Employment Agreement of even
date  herewith.     [signatures on following page]     
C-10      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as
of the date first written above as an instrument under seal.

SECTION 2870  (a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides
that an  employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights
in  an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention 
that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without  using
the employer\'s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret  information
except for those inventions that either:   (1) Relate at the time of
conception or reduction to practice of  the invention to the employer\'s
business, or actual or  demonstrably anticipated research or development of
the  employer; or   (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for
the  employer.  (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement
purports to  require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded
from  being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is 
against the public policy of this state and is
unenforceable.                            EXHIBIT

agent pursuant to this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held by the
Escrow Agent as a trust fund in a separate account (the "ESCROW ACCOUNT")
maintained for the purposes, and on the terms and subject to the conditions,
set forth in this Agreement.   2. INVESTMENT OF ESCROW AMOUNT. During the
term of this Agreement, the Escrow Amount and all interest thereon shall be
invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent in the investment(s) indicated on
SCHEDULE 1. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any
investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required
payments under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for
any loss sustained as a result of any investment in an   
D-1   investment indicated on SCHEDULE 1 or any investment made pursuant to
the instructions of the parties hereto or as a result of any liquidation of
any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the parties to
give the Escrow Agent instructions to reinvest the Escrow Amount.   If the
Escrow Agent has not received joint written instructions of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative ("JOINT WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS") at any time that an
investment decision must be made, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow
Amount and all interest thereon in commercial paper rated AA. All interest
and other income earned on the Escrow Amount through the Termination Date
shall not become part of the Escrow Amount. For tax purposes, all
interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount shall be reported as
taxable income of the Parent and the Escrow Agent shall file applicable tax
forms consistent with such treatment. The Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent
from the Escrow Account annually, no later than thirty (30) days after the
end of each calendar year, the amount of such interest and other income
earned during such calendar year. The correct taxpayer identification number
of Parent and each of the Stockholders is set forth on SCHEDULE 2. As soon as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto, the
Escrow Agent shall be provided with a fully completed and executed Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, from Parent and each of the
Stockholders. The Escrow Agent shall file such reports and withhold such
taxes as it determines is required by law or regulation. It is expressly
agreed and understood that the Escrow Account shall be treated as a grantor
trust of the Parent for tax purposes and Parent shall be responsible for
filing any applicable tax returns with respect to the interest and other
income earned on the Escrow Amount.   3. RELEASE OF ESCROW AMOUNT.   (a)
On each occasion on which Parent determines that any Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification for any amount pursuant to Article IX of the
Merger Agreement, Parent may deliver to the Stockholder Representative and
the Escrow Agent a Claim Certificate for the payment of such amount.   (b)
Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of a
Claim Certificate, the Stockholder Representative may deliver to Parent and
the Escrow Agent a written objection to all or any part of the Claim
Certificate (an "OBJECTION"). The Objection shall set forth in detail the
basis of the Stockholder Representative\'s objection to the Claim
Certificate and the amount in dispute.   (c) If the Stockholder
Representative fails to deliver an Objection to Parent and the Escrow Agent
by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the receipt
by the Stockholder Representative of a Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Indemnified Parties out of the Escrow Amount an amount equal
to the amount requested in the Claim Certificate (up to a maximum of the
Escrow Amount). Any such payment shall be made on or before the second (2nd)
Business Day following the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. The
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold any amounts remaining in the Escrow
Account following the payment of any Claim Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.   (d) If the Stockholder Representative properly
delivers a timely Objection with respect to all or any portion of a Claim
Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse, and shall continue to hold
in the Escrow Account, the amount requested in the Claim Certificate or the
disputed portion    D-2   thereof, as the case may be, pending receipt
of either (i) payment instructions signed by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, specifying the agreement of the parties as to the action to
be taken by the Escrow Agent in respect of such Claim Certificate ("JOINT
PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS") or (ii) a notice from either Parent or the Stockholder
Representative stating that either such Claim Certificate has been submitted
to a court of competent jurisdiction for judgment and that a judgment with
respect to such matters has been rendered or such Claim Certificate has been
submitted to a panel of arbitrators with proper jurisdiction and that a final
non-appealable award with respect to such arbitration has been rendered (in
each case, a "JUDGMENT NOTICE") which is accompanied by a copy of a final,
nonappealable order of such court or such arbitration panel, as the case may
be (each an "ORDER"), pursuant to which such court has determined whether and
to what extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the amount requested
in the Claim Certificate. Upon receipt of Joint Payment Instructions or a
Judgment Notice, as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall thereafter act in
accordance with Section 3(e) or 3(f) below, as applicable. A copy of the
Judgment Notice or Order shall be delivered to each party at the same time as
it is delivered to the Escrow Agent.   (e) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent
of Joint Payment Instructions, if such Joint Payment Instructions indicate
that any Indemnified Parties are entitled to payment in respect of all or any
portion of the Claim Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall release from
the Escrow Account and pay to the Indemnified Parties the amount indicated in
such Joint Payment Instructions (up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount). Such
payment shall be made on or before the second (2nd) Business Day following
the date on which such Joint Payment Instructions are received by the Escrow
Agent. If such Joint Payment Instructions indicate that the Indemnified
Parties are not entitled to all or any portion of the amount claimed in such
Claim Certificate (a "DISCHARGE NOTICE"), then the Escrow Agent shall
continue to hold such amount in the Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement until such amounts are to be disbursed (A) to the
Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3(i), 3(j) or 3(k), (B) to any Indemnified
Parties in respect of another Claim Certificate pursuant to Sections 3(c),
3(e) or 3(f) or (C) to any Person pursuant to Section 3(l).   (f) If the
Escrow Agent has received a Judgment Notice and an Order with respect to any
Claim Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow
Account and pay to the Indemnified Parties an amount equal to the amount due
the Indemnified Parties. Such payment shall be made on or before the second
(2nd) Business Day following the date on which the Escrow Agent received such
Order. If such Order indicates that the Indemnified Parties were not entitled
to all or any portion of the amount claimed in the Claim Certificate (a
"DETERMINATION DISCHARGE"), then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such
amount to which the Indemnified Parties were determined not to be entitled in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement until such amounts are to be
disbursed (A) to the Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3(i), 3(j) or
3(k), (B) to any Indemnified Parties in respect of another Claim Certificate
pursuant to Sections 3(c), 3(e) or 3(f) or (C) to any Person pursuant to
Section 3(l).   (g) Upon receipt of written instructions signed by
the Stockholder Representative indicating that the Stockholder Representative
has incurred expenses in connection with the performance of its duties under
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
reimburse the Stockholder Representative for the amount of such expenses from
the Escrow Account; provided that in no event shall the Escrow Agent
reimburse the    D-3   Stockholder Representative for any amount in
excess of $100,000 for all expenses incurred in the aggregate throughout the
term of this Agreement; provided further that such $100,000 limit shall in no
way limit the Stockholder Representative\'s right to indemnification under
Section 9.5(b) of the Merger Agreement.   (h) As promptly as practicable
following the disbursement of any funds from the Escrow Account, the Escrow
Agent shall send a written statement to the Stockholder Representative and
Parent stating the amount of the disbursement and the amounts remaining in
the Escrow Account.   (i) The twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing
Date is referred to herein as the "INITIAL REDUCTION DATE". On the Initial
Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount shall automatically be reduced by an amount
equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the balance of the Escrow Amount on the
Initial Reduction Date over (y) $20,375,000 (such excess being referred to as
the "INITIAL ESCROW DISBURSEMENT"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day
following the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent
notifying the Escrow Agent of the Initial Reduction Date, subject to the
provisions of the following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the
Stockholders the Initial Escrow Disbursement. If, however, the Escrow Agent
shall have received on or before the Initial Reduction Date one or more Claim
Certificates which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(c) as of
the Initial Reduction Date and as to which, on the Initial Reduction Date,
the Escrow Agent has not received and fully acted upon Joint Payment
Instructions or an Order, nor received a Discharge Notice or a Determination
Discharge (any such Claim Certificate being referred to as an "INITIAL
OUTSTANDING CLAIM"), the Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to hold in
accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the amount requested
in all such Initial Outstanding Claims (the "INITIAL RETAINED AMOUNT") but
shall pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Initial Escrow Disbursement over the Initial Retained Amount; and,
thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account all or
portions of the Initial Retained Amount to Parent and/or the Stockholders, as
applicable, as and when it receives Joint Payment Instructions, Orders,
Discharge Notices or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the
Initial Outstanding Claims. Following the Initial Reduction Date, in the
event that the Initial Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all
Initial Outstanding Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified
Parties or which are not subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination
Discharge, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders within five (5)
Business Days of the Stockholder Representative\'s written request for such
payment, an amount equal to such excess. The balance of the Escrow Amount
shall be held in escrow to fund claims for indemnification by any Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article IX of the Merger Agreement.   (j) The twenty-four
(24) month anniversary of the Closing Date is referred to herein as the
"SECOND REDUCTION DATE". On the Second Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount
shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of
(x) the balance of the Escrow Amount on the Second Reduction Date over (y)
the sum of (a) an amount equal to the portion of the Initial Retained Amount
not previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(i) hereof and (b)
$7,000,000 (such excess being referred to as the "SECOND
ESCROW DISBURSEMENT"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following
the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent notifying the
Escrow Agent of the Second Reduction Date, subject to the provisions of the
following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders the Second
Escrow Disbursement. If, however, the Escrow Agent shall have received on or
before the Second    D-4   Reduction Date one or more Claim Certificates
which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(c) as of the Second
Reduction Date and which were not included in determining the Initial
Retained Amount and as to which, on the Second Reduction Date, the Escrow
Agent has not received and fully acted upon Joint Payment Instructions or an
Order, nor received a Discharge Notice or a Determination Discharge (any such
Claim Certificate being referred to as a "SECOND OUTSTANDING CLAIM" and,
together with the Initial Outstanding Claims, the "OUTSTANDING CLAIMS"), the
Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to hold in accordance with the terms
hereof an amount equal to the amount requested in all such Second Outstanding
Claims (the "SECOND RETAINED AMOUNT" and together with the Initial Retained
Amount not previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(i), the "RETAINED
AMOUNT") but shall pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Second Escrow Disbursement over the Second Retained Amount; and,
thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account all or
portions of the Retained Amount to Parent and/or the Stockholders, as
applicable, as and when it receives Joint Payment Instructions, Orders,
Discharge Notices or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the
Outstanding Claims. Following the Second Reduction Date, in the event
that the Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all Outstanding
Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified Parties or which are not
subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Stockholders within five (5) Business Days of the
Stockholder Representative\'s written request for such payment, an amount
equal to such excess. The balance of the Escrow Amount shall be held in
escrow to fund claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant
to Article IX of the Merger Agreement.   (k) The forty-second (42nd) month
anniversary of the Closing Date is referred to herein as the "FINAL REDUCTION
DATE". On the Final Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the balance of the Escrow Amount
on the Final Reduction Date over (y) the portion of the Retained Amount not
previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(j) hereof (the "FINAL
DISBURSEMENT Amount"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following
the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent notifying the
Escrow Agent of the Final Reduction Date, subject to the provisions of the
following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders from the
Escrow Account the Final Disbursement Amount. If, however, the Escrow Agent
shall have received on or before the Final Reduction Date one or more Claim
Certificates which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(c) as of
the Final Reduction Date and which were not included in determining the
Retained Amount and as to which, on the Final Reduction Date, the
Escrow Agent has not received and fully acted upon Joint Payment Instructions
or an Order, nor received a Discharge Notice or a Determination Discharge
(all such Claim Certificates, together with the Outstanding Claims, the
"FINAL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS"), the Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to
hold in accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the amount
requested in all such Final Outstanding Claims (all such amounts, together
with any portion of the Retained Amount not previously disbursed as provided
in Section 3(j), the "FINAL RETAINED AMOUNT") but shall pay to the
Stockholders an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Disbursement
Amount over the Final Retained Amount; and thereafter the Escrow Agent shall
release from the Escrow Account to Parent    D-5   and/or Stockholders,
as applicable, all or portions of the Final Retained Amount as and when it
receives Joint Payment Instructions, Orders, Discharge Notices
or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the Final
Outstanding Claims. Following the Final Reduction Date, in the event that the
Final Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all Final Outstanding
Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified Parties or which are not
subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Stockholders within three (3) Business Days of the
Stockholder Representative\'s written request for such payment, an amount
equal to such excess.   (l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
the Escrow Agent shall receive Joint Written Instructions to release all or a
portion of the Escrow Amount, then within three (3) Business Days after
receipt of such Joint Written Instructions, the Escrow Agent shall release
the Escrow Amount in accordance with such Joint Written Instructions. The
parties will cooperate in good faith in executing such Joint Written
Instructions whenever reasonably necessary to ensure distributions of
escrowed funds to the party entitled thereto under the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The date on which the entire Escrow Amount has been disbursed from
the Escrow Account shall be referred to herein as the "TERMINATION DATE."  
4. DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT.   (a) DUTIES IN GENERAL.   (1) The Escrow
Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth
herein (and required by applicable law), which the parties agree are
ministerial in nature. If in doubt as to its duties and responsibilities
hereunder, the Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its choice and shall
be protected in any action taken or omitted in connection with the advice or
opinion of such counsel.   (2) If the Escrow Agent becomes involved
in litigation with respect to this Agreement for any reason, it is
hereby authorized to deposit the Escrow Amount with the clerk of such court
in which such litigation is pending, or to interplead all interested parties
in any court of competent jurisdiction and to deposit with the clerk of such
court the Escrow Amount. Upon the happening of either of the above, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully relieved and discharged of any further duties
hereunder.   (3) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions
of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and
its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until
it shall be directed otherwise by Joint Written Instructions or by a final
order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, if the
Escrow Agent should at any time be confronted with inconsistent claims or
demands by the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall also have the right to
interplead such parties in any state or federal court located in the State of
Delaware (or if such court does not have jurisdiction, any other court of
competent jurisdiction), to deposit the Escrow Amount with the clerk of such
court, and to request that such court determine the respective rights of the
parties with respect to this Agreement, and upon doing so, the Escrow Agent
automatically shall be released from any obligations or liability as a
consequence of any claims or demands hereunder.     D-6    (b)
EXCULPATION. Except for the Escrow Agent\'s own willful misconduct or gross
negligence: (i) the Escrow Agent shall have no liability of any kind
whatsoever for its performance of, or from having refrained from performing,
any duties imposed upon the Escrow Agent under this Agreement or for any of
its acts or omissions hereunder; (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not
be responsible for any of the acts or omissions of the parties hereto; (iii)
the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone for damages, losses or
expenses arising out of this Agreement; (iv) the Escrow Agent may rely and/or
act upon any written instrument, document or request believed by the Escrow
Agent in good faith to be genuine and to be executed and delivered by the
proper person, and may assume in good faith the authenticity, validity and
effectiveness thereof and shall not be obligated to make any investigation or
determination as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained
therein; and (v) the Escrow Agent shall have no liability of any kind
whatsoever for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice or opinion of legal counsel. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent
be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits), even if the Escrow
Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action.   (c) NO ADDITIONAL DUTIES. The Escrow
Agent shall have no duties except those that are expressly set forth herein,
and it shall not be bound by any notice of a claim or demand hereunder, or
any waiver, modification, amendment, termination or rescission of this
Agreement, unless received by it in writing.   (d) MISCELLANEOUS. The
Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers or responsibilities hereunder and
exercise any rights hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or
attorneys. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for and shall not be
under a duty to examine or pass upon the validity, binding effect, execution
or sufficiency of this Agreement or of any agreement amendatory or
supplemental hereto.   5. INDEMNITY. The Stockholders and Parent shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent
and its directors, officers, agents and employees (the "INDEMNITEES") from
all loss, liability or expense (including the fees and expenses of counsel)
arising out of or in connection with (i) the Escrow Agent\'s execution and
performance of this Agreement, except in the case of any Indemnitee to the
extent that such loss, liability or expense is due to the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (ii) its following any instructions
or other directions from Parent and the Stockholder Representative, except to
the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly
forbidden by the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.   6. RESIGNATION OF THE
ESCROW AGENT; ACQUISITION OF THE ESCROW AGENT. The Escrow Agent, and any
successor Escrow Agent, may resign at any time as the Escrow Agent hereunder
by giving at least fifteen (15) Business Days written notice to the parties.
Upon such resignation and the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, the
resigning Escrow Agent shall be absolved from any further duties as the
Escrow Agent hereunder. Upon their receipt of notice of   
D-7   resignation from the Escrow Agent, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts jointly to designate a
successor Escrow Agent. If the parties do not agree upon a successor Escrow
Agent within fifteen (15) Business Days after the receipt by the parties of
the Escrow Agent\'s resignation notice, the Escrow Agent may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow
Agent or other appropriate relief and any such resulting appointment shall be
binding upon all parties hereto. By mutual agreement, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right at any time upon not less
than seven (7) Business Days written notice to terminate their appointment of
the Escrow Agent, or any successor Escrow Agent, as the Escrow Agent
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the
Escrow Agent or any successor Escrow Agent shall continue to act as the
Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the
Escrow Agent.   Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow
business of the Escrow Agent\'s corporate trust line of business may be
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further
act.   7. FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE ESCROW AGENT. The fees and the expenses
of the Escrow Agent for its services hereunder shall be paid by Parent
in accordance with SCHEDULE 3. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and removal or resignation of the Escrow
Agent.   8. NOTICES. All notices and other communications required or

reputable overnight courier service that issues a receipt or other
