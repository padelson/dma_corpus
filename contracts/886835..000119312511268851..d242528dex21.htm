(a) _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place

date. The date on which the Closing actually occurs or is deemed to have

(b) _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable

the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

THE SURVIVING COMPANY

Section 2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be and remain the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with

of the Surviving Company from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws.

 



2 Section 2.2 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors

ARTICLE 3 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any other holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or
Merger Sub:

(a)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.1(f)_, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive 0.945
shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), and $7.00 in
cash (the " _Cash Portion_ ", and together with the Stock Exchange Ratio, the
" _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Certificates_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of: (i) a certificate that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Stock
Certificate_ "); or (ii) a non-certificated share of Company Common Stock
held by book entry (a " _Book Entry Share_ "), shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_: (A)
the Merger Consideration; (B) certain dividends and other distributions under
_Section 3.1(e)_; and (C) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock under  _Section 3.1(f)_, in each case without interest.

(c) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be
changed or proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of the occurrence of or record date with respect to any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock or
cash dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration. Nothing in
this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

 



3 (d) _Treatment of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(e) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions that
may be declared or made having a record date after the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the
applicable share-based portion of the Merger Consideration represented thereby
until the holder of record of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has
surrendered such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with
_Section 3.3_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws (including escheat
and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any such Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, in addition to the applicable Merger Consideration
(including cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_):
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the share-based
portion of the Merger Consideration; and (ii) if the payment date for any
dividend or distribution payable with respect to the share-based portion of
the Merger Consideration has not occurred prior to the surrender of such
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, at the appropriate payment date
therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate
and a payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Share. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if such shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger and fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. All holders
of fractional share interests shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Market Price. "
_Market Price_ " means the average of the closing prices of a share of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the
five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third (3rd)
trading day before the Closing.

(g) _Stock of Merger Sub_. The capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall
constitute the only outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Company.

 

Section 3.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1_, but
instead at the 

 



4  Effective Time shall be converted into the right to payment of the fair
value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and at the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
then (a) such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease
to constitute Appraisal Shares, (b) the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL
shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following
the Effective Time, and (c) each such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, upon surrender in
accordance with  _Section 3.3_, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall
deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands, and withdrawal of demands, for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and the Company shall provide
Parent with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.3 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or such other transfer agent(s)
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 3_ through the Exchange Agent, the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger plus the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
3.1(f) _(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the applicable Merger
Consideration in exchange for surrendered shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated
by _Section 3.3(d)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b)  _Exchange Procedure_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later
than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of each Stock Certificate and any Book Entry
Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent or in the case of Book Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company); and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates
and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.1(a)_ (including any dividend or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.1(e)_ and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to  _Section 3.1(f))_. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected
in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Stock 

 



5  Certificate or Book Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor: (A) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder); and (B)
a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and this _Article 3_,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, and the Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 3.1(f) _or on any unpaid dividends and distributions
payable to holders of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to 
_Section 3.1(e)_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make all payments
required pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as practicable following
the valid surrender of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Stock Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.3(b)_,
each Stock Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.1(e)_, in each case without any interest thereon.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_.
All Merger Consideration (including any dividend or other distributions
pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_) issued and paid upon the surrender of Stock
Certificates and Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 3_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, subject, however, to the
Surviving Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to 

 



6   _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, in each case without any
interest thereon.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six
(6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by holders
of Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares (other than Appraisal Shares), and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors
thereof to exchange such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares or to pay the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Article 3_ (including any dividend or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.1(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.1(f)_) upon due surrender of their Stock Certificates and Book
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment pursuant
to this _Article 3_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable
under this _Article 3_ in respect of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue to such holder the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Stock Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section
3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, in each case without any interest
thereon, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Stock Certificates.

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any stock transfer Taxes and such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any
applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 



7 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of cash in the Exchange Fund shall in all
events be limited to investment in direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States government, or in funds investing solely in such obligations, and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article 3_. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_. The parties hereto agree that, for
United States federal income Tax reporting purposes, Parent shall be the
owner of the Exchange Fund. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange
Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled under this _Article 3_, Parent shall take all
steps necessary to promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent additional Merger
Consideration or other cash sufficient to make all payments required under
this Agreement, and Parent shall in any event be liable for payment thereof.
Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration.

(h) _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record
or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in: (a) the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to

Disclosure Letter_ ") (each schedule of which corresponds to a numbered
and/or lettered section of this Agreement and of which disclosure made in any
section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed for
all purposes of this Agreement and all other sections of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
disclosure is responsive or applicable); or (b) the Company SEC Reports filed
with the SEC between January 1, 2010 and the date of this
Agreement (including information set forth in any exhibit thereto, but
excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosure
in any section relating to forward looking statements or any other statements
that are predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than any
historical facts included therein, the " _Specified Company SEC Disclosure_
"), to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure in the
Specified Company SEC Disclosure is responsive to the matters set forth in
this _Article 4_ , the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a

has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in

 



8  good standing (to the extent applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except to the extent

Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has the
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. _Section 4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of the Company Subsidiaries. 

Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The copies of the
Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Company

is in violation of its organizational or governing documents.

or other Equity Interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Other

license, Company Permit or other legally binding obligation to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except, as to clauses (ii) and

occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

securities, takeover or "blue sky" Laws, the rules and regulations of the
NYSE, the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or other regulatory Laws, and
the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL; and (ii)
where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
or to make such filings or notifications, would not (A) prevent or materially
delay or impede performance by the Company of any material obligations under
this Agreement or (B) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(which are the subjects solely of _Sections 4.9_ and  _4.10_ ,
respectively), for environmental matters (which are the subject solely of

its business substantially as it is being conducted as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Permits_ "), and all such Company Permits are, in
all material respects, valid and in full force and effect.

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is, in any material
respect, in conflict with, or in default or violation of (except for Laws or

Section 4.7 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2009, the Company has filed with the SEC all forms,
reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and
other documents

 



11  (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the " _Company SEC Reports_
") required to be filed by the Company with the SEC. As of their respective
filing dates, and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company SEC Reports complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC
Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, except for any current
reports on Form 8-K required to be filed with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, no event has occurred
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary which the Company is, or
after the passage of time, will be, required to report by the filing with the
SEC of a current report on Form 8-K which has not been so reported by the
Company by the filing of a current report on Form 8-K on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. None of the Company Subsidiaries is required to file any

of the Exchange Act.

(b) The consolidated statements of financial position and the related

schedules thereto) of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Financial
Statements_ ") contained in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared from
the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been

as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the dates or for the periods presented therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
in the ordinary course of business).

 

(c) Other than any matters that do not remain the subject of any open or
outstanding inquiry, the Company has not received written notice from the SEC
or any other Governmental Authority that any of its accounting policies or
practices are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or
challenge by the SEC or other Governmental Authority. Since January 1,
2009, the Companys independent public accounting firm has not informed the
Company that it has any material questions, challenges or disagreements
regarding or pertaining to the Companys accounting policies or practices
which are unresolved as of the date of this Agreement. Since January 1, 2009,
no current officer or director of the Company has received, or is entitled to
receive, any material compensation from any entity other than the Company or a
Company Subsidiary that has engaged in or is engaging in any material
transaction with the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(d) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Company SEC
Reports, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
the Company have made all 

 



12  certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the
NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete
and correct as of the date such certifications were made. Other than any
matters that do not remain the subject of any open or outstanding inquiry,
neither the Company nor its officers has received notice from any
Governmental Authority questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness
or form of such certificates. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has outstanding, nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, any "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. As used in this _Section 4.7(d)_,
"principal executive officer," "principal financial officer" and "extensions
of credit" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

(e) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be disclosed
in the Companys reports required to be filed with or submitted to the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. Since January 1, 2010, the Company has not
disclosed, nor does the Company have knowledge of any facts that would require
it to disclose, based on its knowledge and most recent evaluation of such
disclosure controls and procedures, to the Companys auditors or the audit
committee of the Board of the Company: (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information; and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

(f) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with (i) all
current listing and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE and (ii) all
rules, regulations and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC.

2011, except as: (i) disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed after such
date but before the date of this Agreement; or (ii) contemplated by, or as
disclosed pursuant to, this Agreement, there has not been any Company Material

repurchase for value by the Company of any capital stock or other Equity
Interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
other Equity Interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary;

(c) incurred indebtedness for borrowed money or guaranteed such Indebtedness

the terms of an existing agreement or plan that has been disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter;

(h) suffered any loss, damage, destruction or other casualty (whether or

14 Section 4.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section 4.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and
any other material plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding
or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other
benefits to any current or former employee (or to any dependent or beneficiary
thereof of the Company), other than individual employment, severance, change
in control or similar contracts or agreements, which are maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any
Company ERISA Affiliates, or under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has any material obligation or liability, including all material incentive,
bonus, deferred compensation, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase
or equity based compensation plans, policies or programs (each a " _Company
Benefit Plan_ ").

 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code.

(c)(i) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype plan and, to the Companys knowledge, no fact or event has occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Company Benefit Plan; (ii) to the Companys knowledge, there has been
no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a
statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan that could result in material liability to the Company; and (iii) no
suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought
or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened against or with respect to
any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or
United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits claims).

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan and any other agreement, plan or arrangement
that is or is intended to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation"
arrangement under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (" _Section 409A_"), is in and has been operated in compliance
with Section 409A, and no service provider is entitled to a Tax gross-up or
similar payment for any Tax or interest that may be due as a result of
violation of Section 409A.

(e)(i) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA); and (ii) no Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title
IV of ERISA. Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
Company ERISA Affiliates has incurred (A) a partial or complete withdrawal
from a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or
(B) any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material liability under Title
IV of ERISA, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of incurring or being subject (whether
primarily, jointly or secondarily) to a material liability thereunder.

 



15 (f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.9(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no amount could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations

Section 4.14 _Intellectual Property_. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all

Subsidiaries businesses as now operated by them in all material respects. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no (and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received notice of any) material infringement of or
material conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to
any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which would render
any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to carry on the Companys or
any Company Subsidiarys business as now operated by it in all material
respects. 

Section 4.15 _Assets and Properties_. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has fee simple title to all of its material owned real property
and has a valid leasehold interest in all of its material leased real property
(including all rights and privileges pertaining or relating thereto), in each

19  owing under or related to such owned real property and leased real property,
free and clear of any and all Liens, except for Permitted Company Liens. Each
of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has title to, or a valid

Returns. All such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material
respects. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have paid all material
Taxes due or claimed to be due, except for Taxes being contested in good faith
and for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial
statements of the Company. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries reflected in the
consolidated statements of financial position of the Company set forth in the
most recent Company SEC Report are adequate under GAAP to cover unpaid Tax
liabilities accruing through the date thereof. No claim has ever been made by
an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary
does not file Tax Returns that such entity is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction in respect of material Taxes that would be covered by or be
the subject of such Tax Return.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency known to the Company,
nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver.

Liens) upon any of the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(d) No material deficiencies for Taxes with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Taxing
Authority. There are no pending (or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened)
audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No potential
liabilities relating to Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary were
raised by the relevant Taxing Authority in any completed audit or examination
that would reasonably be expected to result in a material additional
liability for Taxes in a later taxable period.

(e) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or other Person.

allocation, Tax sharing or similar agreement (including indemnity
arrangements), other than commercial contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business with vendors, customers and landlords.

 



20 (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has ever been a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which is the Company) for federal,
state, local or foreign Tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise.

 

(h) In the past five years, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary

transaction identified as a "listed transaction" for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or 301.6111-2(b)(2).

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action, nor

expected to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 4.17 _Insurance_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain
insurance in such amounts and covering such losses and risks as, in the
Companys reasonable determination, is adequate to protect the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and is customary for
companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries. All material
insurance policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries: (a) are in
full force and effect; and (b) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in material breach of or default under any such insurance policies,
and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action or
failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a material breach or default, or permit termination or
modification of, any such insurance policies. Promptly following request by
Parent, the Company will make available to Parent copies of all material
insurance policies maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
including fire and casualty, general liability, workers compensation and
employer liability, pollution liability, directors and officers and other
liability policies.

 

Section 4.18 _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no material agreements,
contracts, transfers of assets or liabilities or other commitments or
transactions (other than Company Stock Plans), whether or not entered into in
the ordinary course of business, to or by which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of their respective affiliates (other
than the Company or any Company Subsidiary), on the other hand, are or have

Financial Advisor_ "), whose fees in connection with the Merger are set forth
on _Section 4.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no agent, broker, finder
or investment banker is or will be entitled to any advisory, brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Promptly upon the request of Parent, for informational purposes only, the
Company will furnish to Parent a true and complete copy of the Companys
agreement with the Company Financial Advisor pursuant to which it is entitled
to a fee in connection with the Merger.

against in the Companys consolidated audited balance sheet as of December 31,
2010 (or the notes thereto) as included in the Companys SEC Reports and (b)
for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or contemplated by
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,

and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract

Companys SEC Reports.

numbered and/or lettered section of this Agreement and of which disclosure
made in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement and all other sections of the
Parent Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that
such disclosure is responsive or applicable); or (b) the Parent SEC Reports
filed with the SEC between January 1, 2010 and the date of this Agreement
(including information set forth in any exhibit thereto, but excluding any
disclosure set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any section
relating to forward looking statements or any other statements that are
predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than any historical facts
included therein, the " _Specified Parent SEC Disclosure_ "), to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure in the Specified Parent SEC
Disclosure is responsive to the matters set forth in this _Article 5_,
Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Each of the subsidiaries of Parent (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and,
collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") has been duly organized, and is
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may
be, except to the extent the failure of any such Parent Subsidiary to be in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent, each Parent
Subsidiary and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent, each Parent Subsidiary
and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. _Section 5.1_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter sets forth a true and complete list of the Parent Subsidiaries.

Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Parent Certificate of Incorporation_ ")

Parent nor any material Parent Subsidiary is in violation of its
organizational or governing documents.

respective filing dates, and giving effect to any amendments or supplements
thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent SEC Reports complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to Parent SEC Reports, and none of Parent
SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, except for any
current reports on Form 8-K required to be filed with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, no event has
occurred with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary which Parent is, or
after the passage of time, will be, required to report by the filing with the

outstanding inquiry, Parent has not received written notice from the SEC or
any other Governmental Authority that any of its accounting policies or
practices are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or
challenge by the SEC or other Governmental Authority. Since January 1, 2009,
Parents independent public accounting firm has not informed Parent that it
has any material questions, challenges or disagreements regarding or
pertaining to Parents accounting policies or practices which are unresolved
as of the date of this Agreement. Since January 1, 2009, no current officer
or director of Parent has received, or is entitled to receive, any material
compensation from any entity other than Parent or a Parent Subsidiary that has
engaged in or is engaging in any material transaction with Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary.

related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the
statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct as of
the date such certifications were made. Other than any matters that do not
remain the subject of any open or outstanding inquiry, neither Parent nor its
officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness or form of such certificates. Neither

directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. As used in this _Section 5.7(d)_,
"principal executive officer," "principal financial officer" and "extensions
of credit" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

(e) Parent has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange

Parent and Parent Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in Parents reports
required to be filed with or submitted to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents 

 



29  management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. Since January 1, 2010, Parent has not disclosed, nor
does Parent have knowledge of any facts that would require it to disclose,
based on its knowledge and most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls
and procedures, to Parents auditors or the audit committee of the Board of

value by Parent of any capital stock or other Equity Interests or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or other Equity Interests
in Parent or any Parent Subsidiary;

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and
any other material plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding
or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other
benefits to any current or former employee (or to any dependent or beneficiary
thereof of Parent, other than individual employment, severance, change in
control or similar contracts or agreements), which are maintained, sponsored
or contributed to by Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any Parent ERISA
Affiliates, or under which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any material
obligation or liability, including all material incentive, bonus, deferred
compensation, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase or equity based
compensation plans, policies or programs (each a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ").

(b) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code.

(c)(i) Each Parent Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype plan and, to Parents knowledge, no fact or event has occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Parent Benefit Plan; (ii) to Parents knowledge, there has been no
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or
administrative exemption) with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that could
result in material liability to Parent; and (iii) no suit, 

 



31  administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought or,

that is or is intended to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation"
arrangement under Section 409A is in and has been operated in compliance with
Section 409A, and no service provider is entitled to a Tax gross-up or
similar payment for any Tax or interest that may be due as a result of
violation of Section 409A.

(e)(i) No Parent Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA); and (ii) no Parent Benefit Plan is subject to Title

ERISA Affiliates has incurred (A) a partial or complete withdrawal from a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or (B) any
withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan. Neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has any material liability under Title IV of ERISA, and
no condition exists that presents a material risk to Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary of incurring or being subject (whether primarily, jointly or
secondarily) to a material liability thereunder.

(f) No amount could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting
of property) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of Parent who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.280G-1) under any Parent Benefit Plan could reasonably be expected
to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 

(g) Except as required by Law, no Parent Benefit Plan provides any post-
employment medical or life insurance benefits. Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary are in material compliance with the requirements of the applicable

and any similar state Law.

Section 5.14 _Intellectual Property_. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries own
or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all Intellectual
Property necessary to carry on

 



35  Parents and the Parent Subsidiaries businesses as now operated by them in

Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received notice of any) material
infringement of or material conflict with asserted rights of others with
respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which
would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to carry on
Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys business as now operated by it in all
material respects.

to such owned real property and leased real property, free and clear of any
and all Liens, except for Permitted Parent Liens. Each of Parent and each of

All such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects.
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have paid all material Taxes due
or claimed to be due, except for Taxes being contested in good faith and for
which adequate reserves have been established in the financial statements of
Parent. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries reflected in the consolidated statements of
financial position of Parent set forth in the most recent Parent SEC Report
are adequate under GAAP to cover unpaid Tax liabilities accruing through the

supplements to the Proxy/Prospectus, and shall provide the other party with
copies of all written correspondence and a summary of all oral communications
between it, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy/Prospectus. Each party shall cooperate and

48 Section 7.3 _Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of the Company (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to
effect the following:

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options to
provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option (a " _Converted Parent Option_ ") to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at
a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price
of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Company Stock Option (A) which is an "incentive stock
option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (B) shall be
adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A; and

 

(ii) adjust the terms of all other outstanding awards under the Company Stock
Plans, including Company Restricted Shares, to provide that, at the Effective
Time, each such award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall represent, immediately after the Effective Time, the right to receive,
on the same terms and conditions (other than the terms and conditions
relating to the achievement of performance goals) as were applicable under
such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, equal to the
product of (A) the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such award, multiplied by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (a "
_Converted Parent Stock Award_ "); _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that acceleration of vesting of such award as of the
Effective Time causes such award to be settled for shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.1(a)_.

For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means
the sum of the Stock Exchange Ratio plus a fraction resulting from dividing
the Cash Portion by the Market Price.

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all obligations of the Company
under the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Parent Option and
Converted Parent Stock Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof
and shall administer and honor all such awards in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such awards and the Company Employee Benefit Plans pursuant
to which they were granted. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Converted Parent Options and Converted
Parent Stock Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights,
and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted Parent Options and
Converted Parent Stock Award shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 7.3_ after
giving effect to the Merger).

 

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
or settlement of

 



49  the Converted Parent Options and Converted Parent Stock Awards in accordance
with this _Section 7.3_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
Converted Parent Options and Converted Parent Stock Awards and shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Converted Parent Options and Converted Parent Stock Awards remain
outstanding.

Section 7.4  _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company or
Parent and the Surviving Company from amending or terminating such plans,
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms and the express
terms of this Agreement. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each employee of the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries a package of
compensation and employee benefits that is substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the package of compensation and benefits made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries. To the extent
that an employee of the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time becomes
eligible for participation in an employee benefit plan of Parent or Parent
Subsidiaries: (i) such employee shall receive credit for periods of employment
with the Company (including, without limitation, any predecessor of the
Company) for purposes of applying or determining, as applicable, preexisting
condition limitations, eligibility for participation, and vesting under all
such plans, and, to the extent applicable, Parent shall reduce any period of
limitation on health benefits coverage of such employees due to preexisting
conditions (or actively at work or similar) under applicable health benefit
plans of Parent or its affiliates to the extent required by ERISA Section
701; and (ii) such employee shall not be subjected to evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to any such plan that is a group health plan. If
prior to the Effective Time an employee of the Company as of the Effective
Time or his covered dependents paid any amounts towards a deductible, co-
payment or out-of-pocket maximum in a Company or affiliate health plans
current fiscal year, such amounts shall be applied toward satisfaction of the
applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket maximum in the current
fiscal year of any Parent or Parent Subsidiary health plan for which such
employee may become eligible during the year in which the Closing occurs. On
or before the Effective Time, Company shall inform Parent of the amount paid
towards such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums by each
employee of Company during the year in which the Closing occurs, evidenced by
documentation from Companys health plan insurer or third party
administrator.

(b) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall be construed as
requiring Parent or the Surviving Company to continue (or resume) the
employment or retention of any specific Person.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.4(b)_, no provision of
this _Section 7.4_ shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee,

 



50  officer, director or consultant under a Company Benefit Plan or Parent
employee benefit plan or otherwise, nor shall it be deemed to create, amend or
give rise to any obligation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or
Parent employee benefit plan, each of which remains subject to amendment and
termination in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Except for any executive employee or any key employee, Parent shall not
communicate or otherwise meet with any of the employees of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries to discuss employee benefits without prior notice to the
Company. Such communications and/or meetings shall be limited to topics
directly related to the terms and conditions of employment with Parent and
on benefits or compensation matters following the Effective Time.

Section 7.5 _Section 16 Matters_. No fewer than twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall prepare and cause to be
delivered to Parent a schedule: (a) identifying each individual who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (b)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by each such individual
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock).
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.6 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth
in _Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(c)_. Neither Parent nor the Company will take
(or fail to take) any action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably
be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall report the Transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties acknowledge and agree, that to the
extent necessary to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, Merger Sub will be converted into a limited
liability company or substituted in the Merger for a new entity that is a
limited liability company.

(c) Prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, Parent and the Company
shall execute and deliver to Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere and
Denegre L.L.P. and to Latham and Watkins LLP tax representation letters in
substantially the forms attached to this

 



51  Agreement as Exhibits C and D (each a " _Registration Statement Tax
Representation Letter_ "), respectively. Following the delivery of the
Registration Statement Tax Representation Letters pursuant to the preceding
sentence of this _Section 7.6(c)_, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P.
to deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. In rendering such opinions, Jones,
Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. shall be entitled to
rely on the Registration Statement Tax Representation Letters referred to in
this _Section 7.6(c)_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the Registration Statement Tax Representation
Letters.

 

(d) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order for Parent to obtain the opinion of Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. described in _Section 8.2(c)_ and for the
Company to obtain the opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP described in _Section
8.3(c)_. In connection therewith, both Parent (together with Merger Sub) and
the Company shall deliver to Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere and
Denegre L.L.P. and to Latham and Watkins LLP tax representation letters, dated
and executed as of the dates of such opinions, in substantially the forms
attached to this Agreement as Exhibits E and F (each a " _Merger Agreement Tax
Representation Letter_ "), respectively. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be
taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not
to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the
certifications and representations included in each Merger Agreement Tax
Representation Letter.

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in
connection with the Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or
before the Effective Time. The Surviving Company shall pay, without deduction
from any amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without
reimbursement, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental
Authority, which becomes payable in connection with the Merger.

(f) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare all Tax Returns for any Tax period which are required to be filed on
or before the Closing Date (taking extensions into account) using accounting
methods, principles and positions consistent with those used for prior Tax
periods, unless a change is required by applicable Law or regulation. All such
Tax Returns shall be timely filed and all related Taxes paid on or before the
Closing Date.

respective HSR Act filings and thereafter make any other required submissions
under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable; (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any

of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other

provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to require Parent or the
Company or any of their subsidiaries to divest or agree to divest any assets
which would be reasonably likely either to materially and adversely impact the

subsidiaries, to or from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority
with respect thereto, and permit the other to review in advance any proposed

provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a) _or

Representative of such party to, directly or indirectly: (A) solicit, initiate
or knowingly and intentionally encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information), or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding,

its stockholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to
an Alternative Proposal; (B) except for confidentiality agreements entered
into pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of clause (b) of this

enter into a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement or other

constituting or otherwise relating to an Alternative Proposal; or (C) provide
or cause to be provided any information or data relating to such party or any
of its subsidiaries in connection with, or in response to, any Alternative
Proposal by any Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that, in the event any officer or
director of such party or any of its subsidiaries takes any action or any
Representative of such party with the knowledge of such party takes any
action, in either case that, if taken by such party would be a material
breach of this _Section 7.12_, the taking of such action by such officer,
director or other Representative shall be deemed to constitute a breach of
this _Section 7.12_ by such party.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.12(a)_, the Company and its
Representatives or Parent and its Representatives, as applicable, shall be
entitled, prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote or the Required Parent

to, or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or waive any Standstill
Agreement with respect to, any Person in response to a written third party
proposal with respect to an Alternative Proposal that is submitted to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, by such Person (for so long as such
Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn) if: (i) none of the Company or
Parent, nor their respective subsidiaries and their Representatives,
as applicable, shall have breached the provisions set forth in this _Section
7.12_ in any material respect with respect to such Person; and (ii) the Board
of such party receiving the Alternative Proposal shall have determined, in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel, that the proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor Parent, as
applicable, may enter into negotiations or discussions or supply any
information in connection with an Alternative Proposal without entering into a
confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive in all matters as the
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of August
4, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), except that such
confidentiality agreement may allow such third party to make Alternative
Proposals to such party in connection with the negotiations and discussions
permitted by this _Section 7.12_. The Company and Parent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive or have made available to it (i) an executed copy
of any such confidentiality agreement and notification of the identity of
such Person immediately after the other party commences such discussions or
negotiations or furnishes information to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal or its Representatives and (ii) promptly any non-public information
concerning the Company and Parent and any of their respective subsidiaries,
as applicable, that is provided to the Person making such an Alternative
Proposal or its Representatives which was not

 



56  previously provided or made available to the Company or Parent, as
applicable. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall notify the
other party promptly if any inquiry, contact or proposal related to an
Alternative Proposal is received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or Parent, their respective subsidiaries or
their Representatives, as applicable, and thereafter shall keep the other
party informed in writing, on a reasonably current basis, regarding the status
of any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such
negotiations or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Board of the Company or Parent, as applicable, from complying with
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or
from making any similar disclosure;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject
to _Section 7.12(c)_ or _7.12(d)_ , as applicable, neither the Company or
Parent, nor the Board of the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its recommendation with
respect to this Agreement or in connection with the Merger, or approve (other
than in connection with a termination under _Section 9.3(b)_ or _9.4(b)_ ) or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Alternative
Proposal.

(c) The Board of the Company shall not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify,
or resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or fail to make the
Company Board Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change in the Company
Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
prior to receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Board of the Company may
effect a Change in the Company Board Recommendation in response to (x) an
Effect occurring after the date hereof (other than of or relating to an
Alternative Proposal), that was not known to the Company as of the date of
this Agreement, if the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel, that
its failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws or (y) a Superior Proposal if: (i) the Board of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside counsel, that its failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; (ii)
the Board of the Company provides Parent with at least three (3) Business
Days advance written notice of its intention to make a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation and promptly thereafter provides Parent with the terms
and conditions of, and the identity of any Person making, such Superior
Proposal, and furnishes a copy of the relevant agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents and (iii) prior to the expiration of such three
(3) Business Day period, Parent does not make a bona fide proposal to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Board of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside counsel, would cause such initial Superior Proposal to
cease to be a Superior Proposal after giving effect to, among other things,
the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in _Section 9.5_. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that each successive material amendment or material
revision to a Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the
Company, an additional two (2) Business Days advance notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change in the Company Board Recommendation and a new
determination by the Board of the Company as set forth herein.

(d) The Board of Parent shall not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, or
resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation or fail to make
the Parent Board Recommendation

 



57  (any such action, a " _Change in the Parent Board Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, prior to receipt of the
Required Parent Vote, the Board of Parent may effect a Change in the Parent
Board Recommendation in response to (x) an Effect occurring after the date
hereof (other than of or relating to an Alternative Proposal), that was not
known to Parent as of the date of this Agreement, if the Board of Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents financial advisor
and outside counsel, that its failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws or (y)
a Superior Proposal if: (i) the Board of Parent determines in good faith,
after consultation with Parents financial advisor and outside counsel, that
its failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws; (ii) the Board of Parent provides the Company
with at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice of its intention
to make a Change in the Parent Board Recommendation and promptly thereafter
provides the Company with the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
any Person making, such Superior Proposal, and furnishes a copy of the
relevant agreement and any other relevant transaction documents and (iii)
prior to the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
does not make a bona fide proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that the Board of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with Parents financial advisor and outside counsel, would cause
such initial Superior Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to, among other things, the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in
_Section 9.5_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that each successive material
amendment or material revision to a Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notice by Parent, an additional two (2) Business Days advance notice
of Parents intention to make a Change in the Parent Board Recommendation and
a new determination by the Board of Parent as set forth herein.

(e) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean, with respect to the Company or
Parent, as applicable, any bona fide proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons other than the other party or any of its subsidiaries or any
group of which the other party or any of its subsidiaries is a member: (A) for
a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or any similar
transaction or series of transactions involving such party (or any subsidiary
or subsidiaries of such party whose business constitutes 25% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of such party and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole); (B) for the issuance by such party of 25% or more of their
respective equity securities; or (C) to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, 25% or more of the equity securities or consolidated total assets
of such party and its subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Alternative Proposal which the
Board of the Company or Parent, as applicable, determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of such partys Common Stock than the Merger (or
any bona fide written offer or proposal made by the other party in response
to such Alternative Proposal or otherwise), taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any
conditions to and expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal,

 



58  financial and regulatory aspects of such Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement); _provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of Superior
Proposal, the references to 25% in the definition of Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed references to 50%.

Section 7.13 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the individuals covered by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries respective certificates of incorporation
or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company of any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any retired directors or
officers), in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement,
or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or
officer of another Person (including, without limitation, any retired director
or officer of the Company, to the extent the Company currently provides
indemnification coverage for such individual) (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit or proceeding: (i) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ , that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the
Surviving Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter.

 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.13_.

 



59 (c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or provide substitute polices
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the aggregate
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending
December 31, 2011 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this  _Section 7.13_, it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-
year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of
each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may, following consultation with Parent, purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company for up to $125,000,000 in the
aggregate, in which event the Surviving Company shall cease to have any
obligations under the first sentence of this _Section 7.13(c)_; _provided_
that in no event shall the Company pay with respect to such tail policy more
than the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under _Section 7.13(a)_.

Section 7.14 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation, applies to this Agreement and the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company, as the case may be, shall take all reasonable action to
ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such takeover statute, Law or
regulation.

Section 7.15 _Financing_.

(a) The Company shall provide, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives to provide,

 



60  such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (x)
participating in meetings and presentations, providing information,
documents, opinions and certificates, entering into agreements, and other
actions that are or may be customary in connection with comparable financing
transactions or necessary to permit Parent to fulfill conditions or
obligations under the Financing Commitments and related fee letters, and (y)
taking such actions as reasonably requested by Parent in order that the
Companys obligations under its existing credit facilities and outstanding 8%
senior notes due 2016 may be discharged and satisfied in full at or promptly
after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that (i) none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing, (ii) any offering materials and other related documents
prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Parent or Merger Sub or their
affiliates and financing sources, in connection with Parent and Merger Subs
financing activities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that include any information provided by the Company or any of its
affiliates, including any offering memorandum, bankers book or similar
document used, or any other written offering materials used (collectively, "
_Offering Materials"_ ), in connection with any debt or securities offering
or other such financing by Parent and Merger Sub shall include a disclaimer to
the effect that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates have any
responsibility for the content of such document and disclaim all
responsibility therefor, (iii) the Company shall not be required to incur any
out-of-pocket expenses as a result of actions requested by Parent under this
_Section 7.15(a)_ unless Parent shall have agreed to reimburse the Company
for such out-of-pocket expenses and (iv) the Company shall not be required to
commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger and that would or would reasonably be expected to expose the
Company to material liability or expense if the Merger fails to occur.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Effective Time, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing and the Financing Commitments, (ii) enter into
definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing and Financing
Commitments, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable
but in any event no later than the Effective Time, (iii) satisfy on a timely
basis all Financing Conditions, including by operating the businesses of
Parent and Merger Sub in a manner that will cause the satisfaction of
Financing Conditions relating to the financial condition of such businesses,
and (iv) in the event that the Financing Conditions have been, or upon funding
would be, satisfied, cause the financing providers to fund the full amount of
the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company copies
of all final documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the financing
process relating thereto.

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and
Merger Sub to satisfy its obligations under _Section 7.15(b)_, any of the
Financing or the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement
relating thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or
in part, for any reason, or all or any portion of the Financing shall
otherwise become unavailable (or it shall become reasonably foreseeable that
all or any

 



61  portion of the Financing shall otherwise become available, including as a
result of a breach or repudiation, or threatened or anticipated breach or
repudiation, by any party to the Financing Commitments) Parent and Merger Sub
shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or other
event and the reasons therefor, (ii) promptly arrange for alternative
financing (which shall be in an amount sufficient to pay for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from other sources and
which do not include any conditions of such alternative financing that are in
addition to, or in the aggregate more onerous than, the Financing Conditions
and which shall not be on terms and conditions materially worse than those in
the original commitments) to replace the financing contemplated by such
original commitments or agreements and (iii) promptly obtain a new
financing commitment that provides for such alternate financing and promptly
provide true and complete copies of all agreements relating to such
commitment. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such alternative financing,
such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and the
commitment with respect thereto shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing
Commitments" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
their efforts to obtain the Financing, provide the Company copies of all final
documents relating to the Financing and provide the Company with prompt notice
of any breach by any party to the Financing Commitments of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the Financing Commitments.

Section 7.16  _Board of Directors of Parent_. Parent shall take such actions
as are necessary for the Parent Board to increase the size of the Parent Board
and to appoint or cause to be elected two (2) persons designated by Parent
from the Companys Board, to fill such vacancies, effective as of the
Effective Time, to serve as directors of Parent until each such persons
successor is appointed or until such persons death, retirement, resignation
or removal by the stockholders of Parent. Each designee shall not be an
employee of the Surviving Company, Parent or any Company Subsidiary or Parent
Subsidiary immediately following the Effective Time, and shall qualify as an
independent director of Parent under the listing rules of the NYSE.

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the fees, Expense reimbursement
and the other provisions of this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or
the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties agree that in circumstances where payment of the
Termination Fee is required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of any
Termination Fee in accordance with this  _Section 9.5_, shall be the
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be,
for: (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated; and (ii) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities
suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with
this _Section 9.5_, none of the Company or Parent or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, directors, affiliates, officers or agents, as
the case may be, shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except
as expressly provided in _Section 9.5(c)_).

(e) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Sections 9.1_
through _9.4_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or their respective affiliates or Representatives;  _provided_ , that
(i) _Section 4.19_ and _Section 5.20_ and this _Section 9.5_ will survive
termination hereof and (ii) except as provided in _Section 9.5(d)_, no party
shall be relieved from 

 



69  any liabilities or damages as a result of any willful and material breach by
any party of any of such partys representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
at any time before or after approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by action by or on behalf of the respective Boards of the
parties hereto or the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after any such approval by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment
shall be made without the further approval of such stockholders, except as
permitted by Law. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter) may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Section 9.7 _Waiver_. Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any
obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties
entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each
such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of or estoppel with

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



79 Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto), and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements, representations and undertakings, both written and oral, between
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 10.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto
shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or otherwise without
the prior written consent of the other parties and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be null and void.

inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except that (a) after the Effective Time, each Company Indemnified
Party is intended to be a third party beneficiary of _Section 7.13_ and may

to be a third party beneficiary of _Section 10.12_ and may specifically
enforce the terms of _Section 10.15_.

Section 10.11 _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.

Section 10.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by

upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by, and construed, interpreted and
enforced in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws
principles.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware), and any appellate court therefrom, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered
in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware), (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware), and (iii) waives, to

 



80  the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery
(or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.3_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS
OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 10.13 _Disclosure_. Each party hereto has or may have set forth
information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set
forth in one section of the Disclosure Letter need not be set forth in
any other section of the Disclosure Letter so long as its relevance to the
latter section of the Disclosure Letter or section of the Agreement is
reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Disclosure
Letter. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure
Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material", "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P.

201 St. Charles Avenue

New Orleans, Louisiana 70170

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 9, 2011 (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), among Superior Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _SPN_ "), SPN Fairway Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Merger Sub_ "), and Complete Production Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _CPX_ "), as amended or supplemented through the date hereof.
Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SESI, a Delaware limited liability
company of which SPN is the sole member (" _SESI_ "). Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, CPX shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub
being the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ "). Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P., counsel to SPN and Merger Sub, has been
requested pursuant to Section 7.6(c) of the Merger Agreement to render its
opinion (the " _Opinion_ ") regarding certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger.

 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.



   A. | Statements and Representations. 
---|--- 
 

In connection with the Opinion, and acknowledging that each of you will rely,
with the consent of SPN, SESI and Merger Sub, upon the statements and
representations made in this letter in rendering such Opinion, SPN, SESI and
Merger Sub hereby certify and represent to each of you that the statements and
representations made herein are true, correct and complete in all respects
as of the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete in all respects
as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the Effective Time):

1\. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in
connection therewith are the product of arms length negotiations. The Merger
will be consummated for bona fide business reasons and strictly in accordance
with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provision
thereof). Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement,
there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either written or
oral, between or among (a) any of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub, their affiliates or
shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of CPX, its affiliates or
shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or otherwise, except
for such agreements that are unrelated to the Merger and were entered into
prior to, and without contemplation of, the Merger in the ordinary course of
business on an arms length basis. 2\. The facts and other information relating to the Merger as described in
the Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed
by SPN with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date
hereof, as amended through the date hereof (the " _Registration Statement_ "),
are, insofar as such facts and other information pertain to SPN, SESI and
Merger Sub, true, correct, and complete in all material respects. The facts,
representations and covenants relating to the Merger, as described in the
Merger Agreement, and the documents described in the Merger Agreement, are,
insofar as such facts, representations and covenants pertain to SPN, SESI and
Merger Sub, true, correct, and complete in all material respects.

 

3\. In the Merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
cancelled pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any Appraisal Shares) will be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration, consisting solely of [ ] shares
of Parent Common Stock valued at $[ ] per share as of the date of
the Merger Agreement and $[ ] cash for each share of
Company Common Stock. No CPX shareholder will receive in exchange for such
Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the
Merger Consideration.

4\. No shares of Merger Sub or membership interests of SESI will be issued as
consideration in the Merger.

5\. The Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the Effective Time will be
at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration. For purposes
of this representation:



     | a. | The " _Continuity Value_ " of the Parent Common Stock to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the
Effective Time means the value of such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by reference to the mean between the high and low selling
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
last business day before the Merger Agreement is signed, as reported by
Bloomberg LP (or if not so reported, as reported by such other reporting
service as is reasonably agreed to by the parties); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the
Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of cash
consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, including cash consideration to be paid to Company
Stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii)
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect
to Appraisal Shares. 
---|---|--- 

6\. Parent Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for the election and
removal of the board of directors of SPN. 7\. The fair market value of the Merger Consideration received by each holder
of Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value
of Company Common Stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms
length negotiations between the respective managements of SPN and CPX.

 

8\. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding
the expense and inconvenience to SPN of issuing fractional shares and does not
represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration
that will be paid in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in place of using
fractional shares will not exceed four percent (4%) of the total consideration
that will be issued in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in exchange for
their shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each
CPX shareholder will be aggregated, and no CPX shareholder will receive an
amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common
Stock.

9\. There is no plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of
SPN that, after the Merger, SPN will distribute any dividends or make any
other distributions to the former stockholders of CPX other than dividends or
other distributions made to all stockholders of Parent Common Stock in the
ordinary course of business.

 

10\. Except with respect to open-market purchases of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to a general stock repurchase program of SPN that has not been
created or modified in connection with the Merger or that otherwise satisfies
the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, neither SPN nor any
person related to SPN (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) or (e)(5)) (i) has acquired or has any plan or intention
to acquire stock of the CPX for consideration other than Parent Common Stock
or (ii) has any plan or intention to redeem or acquire any of the Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger (other than cash distributed in the
Merger to CPX shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock) directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or
arrangement with any other person (including derivate transactions, such as
equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition). For
purposes of this representation: (i) any reference to SPN or the CPX includes
a reference to any successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that
the CPX is not treated as a predecessor of SPN and SPN is not treated as a
successor of the CPX; (ii) a corporation is treated as related to another
corporation if they are both members of the same affiliated group within the
meaning of Section 1504 (without regard to the exceptions in Section 1504(b))
or they are related as described in Section 304(a)(2) (without regard to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-80(b)), in either case whether such
relationship exists immediately before or immediately after the acquisition;
and (iii) each partner of a partnership is treated as owning or acquiring any
stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as
having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock)
in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership. As used herein,
the terms " _partnership_ " and " _partner_ " shall have the same meaning
given to them in Section 7701(a)(2).

11\. None of the Merger Consideration that will be received by any CPX
employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX in
connection with the Merger  represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the
performance of any services. The compensation paid to any CPX employee or
independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX will be for services
actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be commensurate
with amount paid to third parties bargaining at arms length.

 

12\. Each of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and CPX will bear its own expenses, and
none of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX will bear the expenses of CPXs
shareholders.

13\. At all times during SESIs existence, SESI has been classified as a
"disregarded entity" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(b)(1)(i)(A), and SESI has not elected to, and has no plan or intention
to elect to, be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes. 

14\. SPN has directly owned all of the membership interests of SESI at all
times during SESIs existence, and SPN will own all such interests
immediately after the Merger and has no plans to dispose of such interests.

15\. SESI has directly owned all of the stock of Merger Sub at all times
during Merger Subs existence, and SESI will own all such stock immediately
after the Merger and has no plans to dispose of such stock.

 

16\. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purposes of effecting the Merger and
has conducted no business or other activities except in connection with the
Merger. Merger Sub has no assets and no liabilities except as were necessarily
acquired pursuant to its incorporation.

17\. Neither SPN nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the last
five years, directly or indirectly, any stock of CPX or any instrument (other
than the Merger Agreement) giving the holder the right to acquire any such
stock.

18\. SPN will have "control" of the Surviving Company immediately after the
Merger. For purposes of this representation and representation 19, "
_control_ " means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent
of the total number of shares of each other class of stock within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(D) and Section 368(c).

19\. There is no plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of
SPN, SESI or Merger Sub that, after the Merger, the Surviving Company will (i)
issue additional shares of stock that would result in SPN losing control of
the Surviving Corporation or (ii) take any other action (including issuing
any rights to acquire stock in the Surviving Company) that could result in SPN
losing control of the Surviving Company, except for transfers permitted by
Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k).

20\. Neither SPN nor SESI has any plan, intention, obligation or understanding
to (i) liquidate the Surviving Company, (ii) merge or convert the Surviving
Company with or into another corporation or other entity, (iii) otherwise
dispose of the stock of the Surviving Company, or (iv) cause the Surviving
Company to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets  of the Surviving Company, except for dispositions made in the ordinary
course of business, dispositions after which the Surviving Company would
continue to hold the assets set forth in representations 21 and 22 hereof, or
transfers permitted by Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(k).

21\. Following the Merger, SPN will continue, or cause to be continued, the
"historic business" of CPX or use, or cause to be used, a "significant
portion" of CPXs "historic business assets" (as such terms are used in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)) in a business either directly or
through one or more members of SPNs qualified group (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) or one or more partnerships in
which SPN and members of its qualified group own an aggregate interest
representing a significant interest in such business or have active and
substantial management functions as partners in such business (each within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

22\. (i) Assuming the correctness of the representation 12(i) in the
representation letter executed by CPX, Merger Sub will acquire from CPX, and
after the Merger the Surviving Company will hold, at least 90 percent of the
fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair
market value of the gross assets held by CPX immediately prior to the Merger
and (ii) after the Merger, the Surviving Company will hold at least 90 percent
of the fair market value of the net assets and 70 percent of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger.
For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as
assets held by CPX or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior but
not subsequent to the Merger: (i) amounts used (or to be used) by CPX or
Merger Sub to pay Merger expenses, (ii) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or
Merger Sub to holders of shares of CPX stock in exchange for their CPX
stock pursuant to the Merger, (iii) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or
Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of CPX as part of
any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, (iv) amounts used (or to be
used) to repay debt, (v) amounts paid by CPX with respect to Appraisal
Shares, and (v) amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by CPX or Merger
Sub to the holders of CPX stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part
of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither Merger Sub nor, to
the knowledge of SPN, CPX has disposed of any assets prior to the Merger in
contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger.

23\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of CPX will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which its assets are subject.

 

24\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between SPN or any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and CPX or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount.

25\. None of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX is under the jurisdiction of a
court in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code, or a receivership,
foreclosure or similar proceeding within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

 

26\. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub is an investment company within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). 27\. No liabilities of any person other than CPX will be assumed by Merger
Sub, SESI or SPN in the Merger, and none of the shares of Company Common
Stock to be exchanged in the Merger will be subject to any liabilities.

 

28\. As of the Effective Time, neither SPN nor any person related to SPN
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and
(e)(5) will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or
of record, during the five years immediately prior to such time, any stock of
CPX, or other securities, options, warrants or instruments (other than
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) giving the holder thereof the right to
acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the CPX.

29\. Payments made in respect of Appraisal Shares, if any, will be made solely
from the funds of the CPX. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub will directly or
indirectly provide funds to make payments in respect of Appraisal Shares, nor
will SPN, SESI or Merger Sub directly or indirectly reimburse CPX for any
payments made with respect to such shares.

30\. To the knowledge of SPN, SESI and Merger Sub, the representations made in
the representation letter delivered by CPX to Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. and dated the date hereof are true,
correct and complete in all material respects.

31\. Each undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and their management, respectively.

_Form of Representation Letter_

Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P.

201 St. Charles Avenue

New Orleans, Louisiana 70170

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 9, 2011 (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), among Complete Production Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _CPX_ "), Superior Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _SPN_ "), and SPN Fairway Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), as amended or supplemented through the date
hereof. Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SESI, a Delaware limited
liability company of which SPN is the sole member (" _SESI_ "). Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, CPX shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with
Merger Sub being the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ "). Jones, Walker,
Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P., counsel to SPN and Merger Sub,
has been requested pursuant to Section 7.6(c) of the Merger Agreement to
render its opinion (the " _Opinions_ ") regarding certain United States
federal income tax consequences of the Merger.

 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.



   A. | Statements and Representations. 
---|--- 
 

In connection with the Opinion, and acknowledging that each of you will rely,
with the consent of CPX, upon the statements and representations made in this
letter in rendering such Opinion, CPX hereby certifies and represents to each
of you that the statements and representations made herein are true, correct
and complete in all respects as of the date hereof and will be true, correct
and complete in all respects as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the
Effective Time):

1\. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into
in connection therewith are the product of arms length negotiations. The
Merger will be consummated for bona fide business reasons and strictly in
accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any
provision thereof). Other than those described or referenced in the Merger
Agreement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either
written or oral, between or among (a) any of CPX, its affiliates or
shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of SPN, Merger Sub, their
affiliates or shareholders, on the other hand, concerning the Merger or
otherwise, except for such agreements that are unrelated to the Merger and
were entered into prior to, and without contemplation of, the Merger in the
ordinary course of business on an arms length basis. 2\. The facts and other information relating to the Merger as described in
the Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed
by SPN with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date
hereof, as amended through the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"),
are, insofar as such facts and other information pertain to CPX, true,
correct, and complete in all material respects. The facts, representations and
covenants relating to the Merger, as described in the Merger Agreement, and
the documents described in the Merger Agreement, are, insofar as such facts,
representations and covenants pertain to CPX, true, correct, and complete in
all material respects

3\. In the Merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company cancelled
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any Appraisal Shares) will be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration, consisting solely of [ ] shares of Parent
Common Stock valued at $[ ] per share as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and $[ ] cash for each share of Company Common Stock. No
CPX shareholder will receive in exchange for such Company Common Stock,
directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger Consideration.

4\. The Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the Effective Time will be
at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration. For purposes
of this representation:



     | a. | The " _Continuity Value_ " of the Parent Common Stock to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the
Effective Time means the value of such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by reference to the mean between the high and low selling
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
last business day before the Merger Agreement is signed, as reported by
Bloomberg LP (or if not so reported, as reported by such other reporting
service as is reasonably agreed to by the parties); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the
Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of cash
consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, including cash consideration to be paid to Company
Stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii)
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect
to Appraisal Shares. 
---|---|--- 

5\. The fair market value of Merger Consideration received by each holder of
Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of
Company Common Stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms
length negotiations between the respective managements of SPN and CPX. 6\. No shares of Merger Sub or membership interests of SESI will be issued as
consideration in the Merger.

7\. Neither CPX nor any person related to CPX within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) (without regard to paragraph
(e)(4)(i)(A) thereof) and (e)(5) has purchased, reacquired or redeemed, or
made any distributions with respect to, any CPX stock prior to the Merger in
contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger, either directly or indirectly
through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person
(including derivate transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the
economic effect of an acquisition). To the best knowledge of CPX, there is no
plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of any CPX
shareholder to sell, exchange, or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly,
any of the Parent Common Stock that will be received pursuant to the Merger to
SPN or any person related to SPN (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) or (e)(5)), other than through open market
purchases of Parent Common Stock pursuant to a general stock repurchase
program of SPN that has not been created or modified in connection with the
Merger or that otherwise satisfies the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58,
1999-2 C.B. 701. For purposes of this representation, any reference to SPN or
the CPX includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such
corporation (except that the CPX is not treated as a predecessor of SPN and
SPN is not treated as a successor of the CPX).

8\. The liabilities of CPX assumed in the Merger and the liabilities to which
the transferred assets of CPX are subject were incurred by CPX in the ordinary
course of its business.

 

9\. None of the Merger Consideration that will be received by any CPX employee
or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX in connection with
the Merger represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable
to the performance of any services. The compensation paid to any CPX employee
or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX will be
for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be
commensurate with amount paid to third parties bargaining at arms length.

10\. Each of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and CPX will bear its own expenses, and
none of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX will bear the expenses of CPXs
shareholders.

 

11\. To the knowledge of CPX, SPN will have "control" of the Surviving Company
immediately after the Merger. For purposes of this representation, "
_control_ " means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent
of the total number of shares of each other class of stock within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(D) and Section 368(c).

12\. The business currently carried on by CPX is its "historic business"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). No assets of the
CPX have been or will be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of which
would prevent SPN, Merger Sub or any other member of SPNs qualified group
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from
continuing the "historic business" of the CPX or from using a "significant
portion" of the Companys "historic business assets" in a business following
the Merger, as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). 13\. After the Merger, the Surviving Company will hold (i) at least 90 percent
of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the
fair market value of the gross assets held by CPX immediately prior to the
Merger, and (ii) to the knowledge of CPX, at least 90 percent of the fair
market value of the net assets and 70 percent of the fair market value of the
gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes
of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets held
by CPX or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior but not
subsequent to the Merger: (a) amounts used (or to be used) by CPX or Merger
Sub to pay Merger expenses, (b) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or Merger
Sub to holders of shares of CPX stock in exchange for their CPX stock
pursuant to the Merger, (c) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or Merger Sub
to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of CPX as part of any overall
plan of which the Merger is a part, (d) amounts used (or to be used) to repay
debt, (e) amounts paid by CPX with respect to Appraisal Shares, and (f)
amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by CPX or Merger Sub to the holders
of CPX stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall
plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither CPX nor, to the knowledge of CPX,
Merger Sub has disposed of any assets prior to the Merger in contemplation of,
or as part of, the Merger.

 

14\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of CPX will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which its assets are subject.

15\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between CPX or any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and SPN or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount.

16\. CPX is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of
the United States Code, or a receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A). 

17\. CPX is not an investment company within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

 

18\. No liabilities of any person other than CPX will be assumed by Merger
Sub, SESI or SPN in the Merger, and none of the shares of Company Common
Stock to be exchanged in the Merger will be subject to any liabilities.

19\. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding
the expense and inconvenience to SPN of issuing fractional shares and does not
represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in place
of using fractional shares will not exceed 1 percent of the total
consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in
exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share
interests of each CPX shareholder will be aggregated, and no CPX shareholder
will receive an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of
Parent Common Stock. 20\. Payments made in respect of Appraisal Shares, if any, will be made solely
from the funds of the CPX. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub will directly or
indirectly provide funds to make payments in respect of Appraisal Shares, nor
will SPN, SESI or Merger Sub directly or indirectly reimburse CPX for any
payments made with respect to such shares.

21\. All of the CPXs currently outstanding financial positions that it has
ever treated as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes (by deducting
interest or otherwise) are properly classified as indebtedness rather than as
equity for such purposes and have not been treated as other than debt for any
other purpose. The only currently outstanding financial position of Company
that it has ever treated as equity for federal income tax purposes is the
Company Common Stock.

 

22\. To the knowledge of CPX, the representations made in the representation
letter delivered by SPN, SESI and Merger Sub to Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. and dated the date hereof are true,
correct and complete in all material respects.

23\. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of CPX and its management.



   B. | Reliance by You in Rendering Opinion: Limitations on Your Opinion. 
---|--- 

The undersigned acknowledges that your opinion will be (i) based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto (including, but not limited to, the Registration Statement and
Proxy/Prospectus), (ii) based on the consummation of the Merger in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) subject to certain
limitations and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if
any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of
such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all respects. The
undersigned further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinion,
you may consider each of the representations herein to be true, correct and
complete without regard to any knowledge qualification not expressly made
herein. CPX undertakes to inform each of you immediately should any of the foregoing
statements or representations become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any
respect at or prior to the Effective Time.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 9, 2011 (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), among Superior Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _SPN_ "), SPN Fairway Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Merger Sub_ "), and Complete Production Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _CPX_ "), as amended or supplemented through the date hereof.
Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SESI, a Delaware limited liability
company of which SPN is the sole member (" _SESI_ "). Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, CPX shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger
Sub being the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ "). Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P., counsel to SPN and Merger Sub, and
Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to CPX, have been requested pursuant to
Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement to render their opinion
(the " _Opinions_ ") regarding certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger.

 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.



   A. | Statements and Representations. 
---|--- 
 

In connection with the Opinions, and acknowledging that each of you will rely,
with the consent of SPN, SESI and Merger Sub, upon the statements and
representations made in this letter in rendering such Opinions, SPN, SESI and
Merger Sub hereby certify and represent to each of you that the statements and
representations made herein are true, correct and complete in all respects
as of the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete in all respects
as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the Effective Time):

1\. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in
connection therewith are the product of arms length negotiations. The Merger
will be consummated for bona fide business reasons and strictly in accordance
with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provision
thereof). Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement,
there are no agreements, arrangements or   understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of SPN,
SESI, Merger Sub, their affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b)
any of CPX, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the
Merger or otherwise, except for such agreements that are unrelated to the
Merger and were entered into prior to, and without contemplation of, the
Merger in the ordinary course of business on an arms length basis.

2\. The facts and other information relating to the Merger as described in the
Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed by
SPN with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof,
as amended through the date hereof (the " _Registration Statement_ "), are,
insofar as such facts and other information pertain to SPN, SESI and Merger
Sub, true, correct, and complete in all material respects. The facts,
representations and covenants relating to the Merger, as described in the
Merger Agreement, and the documents described in the Merger Agreement, are,
insofar as such facts, representations and covenants pertain to SPN, SESI and
Merger Sub, true, correct, and complete in all material respects.

3\. In the Merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company cancelled
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any Appraisal Shares) will be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration, consisting solely of [ ] shares
of Parent Common Stock valued at $[ ] per share as of the date of
the Merger Agreement and $[ ] cash for each share of
Company Common Stock. No CPX shareholder will receive in exchange for such
Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the
Merger Consideration.

4\. No shares of Merger Sub or membership interests of SESI will be issued as
consideration in the Merger.

5\. The Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the Effective Time will be
at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration. For purposes
of this representation:



     | a. | The " _Continuity Value_ " of the Parent Common Stock to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the
Effective Time means the value of such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by reference to the mean between the high and low selling
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
last business day before the Merger Agreement is signed, as reported by
Bloomberg LP (or if not so reported, as reported by such other reporting
service as is reasonably agreed to by the parties); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the
Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of cash
consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, including cash consideration to be paid to Company
Stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii)
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect
to Appraisal Shares. 
---|---|--- 6\. Parent Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for the election and
removal of the board of directors of SPN.

7\. The fair market value of the Merger Consideration received by each holder
of Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value
of Company Common Stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms
length negotiations between the respective managements of SPN and CPX.

 

8\. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding
the expense and inconvenience to SPN of issuing fractional shares and does not
represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration
that will be paid in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in place of using
fractional shares will not exceed four percent (4%) of the total consideration
that will be issued in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in exchange for
their shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each
CPX shareholder will be aggregated, and no CPX shareholder will receive an
amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common
Stock.

9\. There is no plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of
SPN that, after the Merger, SPN will distribute any dividends or make any
other distributions to the former stockholders of CPX other than dividends or
other distributions made to all stockholders of Parent Common Stock in the
ordinary course of business.

 

10\. Except with respect to open-market purchases of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to a general stock repurchase program of SPN that has not been
created or modified in connection with the Merger or that otherwise satisfies
the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, neither SPN nor any
person related to SPN (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) or (e)(5)) (i) has acquired or has any plan or intention
to acquire stock of the CPX for consideration other than Parent Common Stock
or (ii) has any plan or intention to redeem or acquire any of the Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger (other than cash distributed in the
Merger to CPX shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock) directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or
arrangement with any other person (including derivate transactions, such as
equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition). For
purposes of this representation: (i) any reference to SPN or the CPX includes
a reference to any successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that
the CPX is not treated as a predecessor of SPN and SPN is not treated as a
successor of the CPX; (ii) a corporation is treated as related to another
corporation if they are both members of the same affiliated group within the
meaning of Section 1504 (without regard to the exceptions in Section 1504(b))
or they are related as described in Section 304(a)(2) (without regard to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-80(b)), in either case whether such
relationship exists immediately before or immediately after the acquisition;
and (iii) each partner of a partnership is treated as owning or acquiring any
stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as
having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock)
in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership. As used herein,
the terms " _partnership_ " and " _partner_ " shall have the same meaning
given to them in Section 7701(a)(2). 11\. None of the Merger Consideration that will be received by any CPX
employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX in
connection with the Merger represents separately bargained-for consideration
that is allocable to the performance of any services. The compensation paid to
any CPX employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX
will be for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or
will be commensurate with amount paid to third parties bargaining at arms
length.

 

12\. Each of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and CPX will bear its own expenses, and
none of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX will bear the expenses of CPXs
shareholders.

13\. At all times during SESIs existence, SESI has been classified as a
"disregarded entity" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(b)(1)(i)(A), and SESI has not elected to, and has no plan or intention
to elect to, be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes. 

14\. SPN has directly owned all of the membership interests of SESI at all
times during SESIs existence, and SPN will own all such interests
immediately after the Merger and has no plans to dispose of such interests.

15\. SESI has directly owned all of the stock of Merger Sub at all times
during Merger Subs existence, and SESI will own all such stock immediately
after the Merger and has no plans to dispose of such stock.

 

16\. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purposes of effecting the Merger and
has conducted no business or other activities except in connection with the
Merger. Merger Sub has no assets and no liabilities except as were necessarily
acquired pursuant to its incorporation.

17\. Neither SPN nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the last
five years, directly or indirectly, any stock of CPX or any instrument (other
than the Merger Agreement) giving the holder the right to acquire any such
stock.

18\. SPN will have "control" of the Surviving Company immediately after the
Merger. For purposes of this representation and representation 19, "
_control_ " means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent
of the total number of shares of each other class of stock within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(D) and Section 368(c).

19\. There is no plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of
SPN, SESI or Merger Sub that, after the Merger, the Surviving Company will (i)
issue additional shares of stock that would result in SPN losing control of
the Surviving Corporation or (ii) take any other action (including issuing
any rights to acquire stock in the Surviving Company) that could result in SPN
losing control of the Surviving Company, except for transfers permitted by
Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k). 20\. Neither SPN nor SESI has any plan, intention, obligation or understanding
to (i) liquidate the Surviving Company, (ii) merge or convert the Surviving
Company with or into another corporation or other entity, (iii) otherwise
dispose of the stock of the Surviving Company, or (iv) cause the Surviving
Company to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the Surviving
Company, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business,
dispositions after which the Surviving Company would continue to hold the
assets set forth in representations 21 and 22 hereof, or transfers permitted
by Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k).

21\. Following the Merger, SPN will continue, or cause to be continued, the
"historic business" of CPX or use, or cause to be used, a "significant
portion" of CPXs "historic business assets" (as such terms are used in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)) in a business either directly or
through one or more members of SPNs qualified group (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) or one or more partnerships in
which SPN and members of its qualified group own an aggregate interest
representing a significant interest in such business or have active and
substantial management functions as partners in such business (each within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

22.(i) Assuming the correctness of the representation 12(i) in the
representation letter executed by CPX, Merger Sub will acquire from CPX, and
after the Merger the Surviving Company will hold, at least 90 percent of the
fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair
market value of the gross assets held by CPX immediately prior to the Merger
and (ii) after the Merger, the Surviving Company will hold at least 90 percent
of the fair market value of the net assets and 70 percent of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger.
For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as
assets held by CPX or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior but
not subsequent to the Merger: (i) amounts used (or to be used) by CPX or
Merger Sub to pay Merger expenses, (ii) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or
Merger Sub to holders of shares of CPX stock in exchange for their CPX
stock pursuant to the Merger, (iii) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or
Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of CPX as part of
any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, (iv) amounts used (or to be
used) to repay debt, (v) amounts paid by CPX with respect to Appraisal
Shares, and (v) amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by CPX or Merger
Sub to the holders of CPX stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part
of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither Merger Sub nor, to
the knowledge of SPN, CPX has disposed of any assets prior to the Merger in
contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger.

23\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of CPX will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which its assets are subject.

 

24\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between SPN or any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and CPX or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount. 25\. None of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX is under the jurisdiction of a court
in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code, or a receivership,
foreclosure or similar proceeding within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

26\. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub is an investment company within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

27\. No liabilities of any person other than CPX will be assumed by Merger
Sub, SESI or SPN in the Merger, and none of the shares of Company Common Stock
to be exchanged in the Merger will be subject to any liabilities.

28\. As of the Effective Time, neither SPN nor any person related to SPN
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and
(e)(5) will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or
of record, during the five years immediately prior to such time, any stock of
CPX, or other securities, options, warrants or instruments (other than
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) giving the holder thereof the right to
acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the CPX.

29\. Payments made in respect of Appraisal Shares, if any, will be made solely
from the funds of the CPX. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub will directly or
indirectly provide funds to make payments in respect of Appraisal Shares, nor
will SPN, SESI or Merger Sub directly or indirectly reimburse CPX for any
payments made with respect to such shares.

30\. To the knowledge of SPN, SESI and Merger Sub, the representations made in
the representation letter delivered by CPX to Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. and Latham and Watkins LLP and dated the
date hereof are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

 

31\. Each undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and their management, respectively.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 9, 2011 (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), among Complete Production Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _CPX_ "), Superior Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _SPN_ "), and SPN Fairway Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), as amended or supplemented through the date
hereof. Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SESI, a Delaware limited
liability company of which SPN is the sole member (" _SESI_ "). Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, CPX shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with
Merger Sub being the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ "). Jones, Walker,
Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere, and Denegre L.L.P., counsel to SPN and Merger Sub,
and Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to CPX, have been requested pursuant to
Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement to render their opinion
(the " _Opinions_ ") regarding certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger.

 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.



   A. | Statements and Representations. 
---|--- 
 

In connection with the Opinions, and acknowledging that each of you will rely,
with the consent of CPX, upon the statements and representations made in this
letter in rendering such Opinions, CPX hereby certifies and represents to each
of you that the statements and representations made herein are true, correct
and complete in all respects as of the date hereof and will be true, correct
and complete in all respects as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the
Effective Time):

1\. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into
in connection therewith are the product of arms length negotiations. The
Merger will be consummated for bona fide business reasons and strictly in
accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any
provision thereof). Other than those described or referenced in the Merger
Agreement, there are no agreements, arrangements or  understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of CPX, its
affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of SPN, Merger Sub,
their affiliates or shareholders, on the other hand, concerning the Merger or
otherwise, except for such agreements that are unrelated to the Merger and
were entered into prior to, and without contemplation of, the Merger in the
ordinary course of business on an arms length basis.

2\. The facts and other information relating to the Merger as described in the
Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed by
SPN with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof,
as amended through the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"), are,
insofar as such facts and other information pertain to CPX, true, correct,
and complete in all material respects. The facts, representations and
covenants relating to the Merger, as described in the Merger Agreement, and
the documents described in the Merger Agreement, are, insofar as such facts,
representations and covenants pertain to CPX, true, correct, and complete in
all material respects

3. In the Merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company cancelled
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any Appraisal Shares) will be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration, consisting solely of [__] shares of Parent
Common Stock valued at $[ ] per share as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and $[ ] cash for each share of Company Common Stock. No
CPX shareholder will receive in exchange for such Company Common Stock,
directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger
Consideration.

4\. The Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the Effective Time will
be at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration. For
purposes of this representation:



     | a. | The " _Continuity Value_ " of the Parent Common Stock to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger as of the
Effective Time means the value of such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by reference to the mean between the high and low selling
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
last business day before the Merger Agreement is signed, as reported by
Bloomberg LP (or if not so reported, as reported by such other reporting
service as is reasonably agreed to by the parties); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the
Continuity Value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of cash
consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, including cash consideration to be paid to Company
Stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii)
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect
to Appraisal Shares. 
---|---|--- 

5\. The fair market value of Merger Consideration received by each holder of
Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of
Company Common Stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms
length negotiations between the respective managements of SPN and CPX. 6\. No shares of Merger Sub or membership interests of SESI will be issued as
consideration in the Merger.

7\. Neither CPX nor any person related to CPX within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) (without regard to paragraph
(e)(4)(i)(A) thereof) and (e)(5) has purchased, reacquired or redeemed, or
made any distributions with respect to, any CPX stock prior to the Merger in
contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger, either directly or indirectly
through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person
(including derivate transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the
economic effect of an acquisition). To the best knowledge of CPX, there is no
plan, intention, obligation or understanding on the part of any CPX
shareholder to sell, exchange, or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly,
any of the Parent Common Stock that will be received pursuant to the Merger to
SPN or any person related to SPN (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) or (e)(5)), other than through open market
purchases of Parent Common Stock pursuant to a general stock repurchase
program of SPN that has not been created or modified in connection with the
Merger or that otherwise satisfies the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58,
1999-2 C.B. 701. For purposes of this representation, any reference to SPN or
the CPX includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such
corporation (except that the CPX is not treated as a predecessor of SPN and
SPN is not treated as a successor of the CPX).

8\. The liabilities of CPX assumed in the Merger and the liabilities to which
the transferred assets of CPX are subject were incurred by CPX in the ordinary
course of its business.

 

9\. None of the Merger Consideration that will be received by any CPX employee
or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX in connection with
the Merger represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable
to the performance of any services. The compensation paid to any CPX employee
or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of CPX will be
for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be
commensurate with amount paid to third parties bargaining at arms length.

10\. Each of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub and CPX will bear its own expenses, and
none of SPN, SESI, Merger Sub or CPX will bear the expenses of CPXs
shareholders.

 

11\. To the knowledge of CPX, SPN will have "control" of the Surviving Company
immediately after the Merger. For purposes of this representation, "
_control_ " means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent
of the total number of shares of each other class of stock within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(D) and Section 368(c).

12\. The business currently carried on by CPX is its "historic business"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). No assets of the
CPX have been or will be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of which
would prevent SPN, Merger Sub or any other   member of SPNs qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from continuing the "historic business" of the CPX
or from using a "significant portion" of the Companys "historic business
assets" in a business following the Merger, as such terms are used in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

 

13\. After the Merger, the Surviving Company will hold (i) at least 90 percent
of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the
fair market value of the gross assets held by CPX immediately prior to the
Merger, and (ii) to the knowledge of CPX, at least 90 percent of the fair
market value of the net assets and 70 percent of the fair market value of the
gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes
of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets held
by CPX or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior but not subsequent
to the Merger: (a) amounts used (or to be used) by CPX or Merger Sub to pay
Merger expenses, (b) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or Merger Sub to
holders of shares of CPX stock in exchange for their CPX stock pursuant to the
Merger, (c) amounts paid (or to be paid) by CPX or Merger Sub to redeem
stock, securities, warrants or options of CPX as part of any overall plan of
which the Merger is a part, (d) amounts used (or to be used) to repay debt,
(e) amounts paid by CPX with respect to Appraisal Shares, and (f) amounts
distributed (or to be distributed) by CPX or Merger Sub to the holders of CPX
stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of
which the Merger is a part. Neither CPX nor, to the knowledge of CPX, Merger
Sub has disposed of any assets prior to the Merger in contemplation of, or as
part of, the Merger.

14\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of CPX will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which its assets are subject.

 

15\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between CPX or any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and SPN or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount.

16\. CPX is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of
the United States Code, or a receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

 

17\. CPX is not an investment company within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

 

18\. No liabilities of any person other than CPX will be assumed by Merger
Sub, SESI or SPN in the Merger, and none of the shares of Company Common
Stock to be exchanged in the Merger will be subject to any liabilities.

19\. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding
the expense and inconvenience to SPN of issuing fractional shares and does not
represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in place
of using fractional shares will not exceed 1 percent of the total
consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the CPX shareholders in
exchange for their  shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each CPX
shareholder will be aggregated, and no CPX shareholder will receive an amount
equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

20\. Payments made in respect of Appraisal Shares, if any, will be made solely
from the funds of the CPX. None of SPN, SESI or Merger Sub will directly or
indirectly provide funds to make payments in respect of Appraisal Shares, nor
will SPN, SESI or Merger Sub directly or indirectly reimburse CPX for any
payments made with respect to such shares.

21\. All of the CPXs currently outstanding financial positions that it has
ever treated as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes (by deducting
interest or otherwise) are properly classified as indebtedness rather than as
equity for such purposes and have not been treated as other than debt for any
other purpose. The only currently outstanding financial position of Company
that it has ever treated as equity for federal income tax purposes is the
Company Common Stock.

 

22\. To the knowledge of CPX, the representations made in the representation
letter delivered by SPN, SESI and Merger Sub to Jones, Walker, Waechter,
Poitevent, Carrere and Denegre L.L.P. and Latham and Watkins LLP and dated the
date hereof are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

 

23\. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of CPX and its management.

 



   B. | Reliance by You in Rendering Opinion: Limitations on Your Opinion. 
---|--- 

The undersigned acknowledges that your opinions will be (i) based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto (including, but not limited to, the Registration Statement and
Proxy/Prospectus), (ii) based on the consummation of the Merger in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) subject to certain
limitations and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if
any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of such

consider each of the representations herein to be true, correct and complete
without regard to any knowledge qualification not expressly made herein. CPX undertakes to inform each of you immediately should any of the foregoing
statements or representations become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any
respect at or prior to the Effective Time.
