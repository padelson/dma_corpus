and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Buyer Stock
Consideration. Seller fully understands that the Buyer Stock Consideration is
a speculative investment which involves a high degree of risk of loss of
Sellers entire investment. Seller understands that none of the Buyer Stock
Consideration will have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act or any
applicable state securities Laws, that the Buyer Stock Consideration will be
characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities Laws, and
that the Buyer Stock Consideration may not be sold or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.
Seller has had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the
management and authorized representatives of Buyer, and to review any other
relevant documents and records concerning the business of Buyer, including all
of Buyers current filings with the SEC, and the terms and conditions of this
investment, and that any such questions have been answered to Sellers full
satisfaction. Seller understands that no Governmental Authority has passed
upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of an investment in the Buyer
Stock Consideration.

 



 

(b) Seller is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D
under the Securities Act and was not organized solely for the purpose of
acquiring any of the Buyer Stock Consideration. Seller has adequate means of
providing for its current needs and

 



     

 

 



 

contingencies, has no need now, and anticipates no need in the foreseeable
future, to sell any portion of the Buyer Stock Consideration, and currently
has sufficient net worth and financial liquidity to afford a complete loss of
its investment in Buyer. No person or entity, other than Buyer or its
authorized representatives, has offered the Buyer Stock Consideration to
Seller. Seller is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Buyer
Stock Consideration.

or (ii) made any contribution to any candidate for public office, in the case
of clause (i) or (ii), where either the payment or the purpose of such
contribution, payment or gift was, is or would be prohibited under any
applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption Law of any relevant jurisdiction
covering a similar subject matter as in effect at or prior to the Closing
applicable to the performance of the Seller Services. Seller and its
Affiliates, with respect to the performance of the Seller Services, have
instituted and maintained policies and procedures intended to ensure continued
compliance with such Law.

forth in _Article 6_ and in the closing certificate delivered by Buyer,
Sellers own expertise, and Sellers Representatives as to Buyer and the
Retained Obligations, and not on any other comments, representations,
warranties or statements of, or information provided by, Buyer or any
Representatives of Buyer. Seller acknowledges and affirms that (a) it has
completed such independent investigation, verification, analysis, and
evaluation of Buyer and the Retained Obligations and has made all such reviews
of Buyer and the Retained Obligations as it has deemed necessary or
appropriate to enter into this Agreement, and (b) at Closing, Seller shall

verification, analysis, and evaluation of Buyer and the Retained Obligations
and made all such reviews of Buyer and the Retained Obligations as Seller has
deemed necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by Buyer
in _Article 6_ and the closing certificate to be delivered by Buyer, Seller
acknowledges that neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives has made, and
Seller has not relied on, any representations or warranties, express or
implied, as to Buyer and the Retained Obligations. Seller has no Knowledge of

(a) _Access_. From the Execution Date until two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing, Seller and Pioneer shall afford, and shall cause each of its
respective Affiliates to afford, to Buyer and its authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours on Business Days and in such
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with normal operation of Sellers,

Records, together with all operating data and other information, books and
contracts in the possession or control of Seller, Pioneer and their respective
Affiliates and relating primarily to the Assets, and (C) the appropriate

Seller and Pioneer shall have the right to have a Representative present at
all times during any such inspections, interviews and examinations. In
connection with the foregoing, Buyer may, at its option, but subject to

consulting or engineering firm (the " _Environmental Consultant_ ") and such
Environmental Consultant may conduct visual inspections, record reviews, and
interviews relating to such Real Property, as applicable, including their
condition and their compliance with Environmental Laws (collectively the "
_Phase I Assessment_ "). Buyers right of access shall not, in any
circumstance, entitle Buyer to conduct testing, sampling, boring, drilling or
invasive activities or a Phase II environmental assessment or similar or more
extensive assessment of all or any portion of the Real Property without the
prior written consent of Seller and Pioneer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller and Pioneer shall have
the right to be present during the Phase I Assessment. Buyer shall coordinate
the Phase I Assessment with Seller and Pioneer to minimize any inconvenience
to or interruption of the conduct of business by Seller and Pioneer. Buyer
shall abide by Sellers, Pioneers, and any Third Party operators, safety
rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Real Property, as applicable, including the Phase I
Assessment. The Phase I Assessment shall be conducted at the sole risk, cost
and expense of Buyer, and all of Buyers and the Environmental Consultants
activity conducted under this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be subject to the
indemnity provisions of _Section 7.4(b)_. All information or data obtained
under this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, and Buyer is prohibited from disclosing any such information or
data to any Third Parties, including any Governmental Authority, without the
prior written consent of Seller and Pioneer, which consent may be granted or
withheld by Seller and Pioneer in their sole discretion. Buyer will provide
Seller and Pioneer a copy of any final reports, data and conclusions relating
to the Phase I Assessment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no
right of access to, and neither Seller nor Pioneer shall have any obligation
to provide to Buyer, information relating to: (i) the identity of bidders and
potential bidders and bids received from others in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or similar transactions) and
information and analyses (including financial analyses) relating to such bids;
(ii) any information, the disclosure of which would, in Sellers and Pioneers
good faith opinion following consultation with outside counsel, jeopardize any
legal privilege against disclosure available to Seller, Pioneer or any of
their respective Affiliates relating to such information or would cause
Seller, Pioneer or any of their respective Affiliates to breach a
confidentiality obligation arising under any contract; (iii) any information
the

 



     

 

 



 

disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law; or (iv) the Income Tax
Returns of Seller, Pioneer or any of their Affiliates. All requests for
information made under this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be directed to the Person
designated in writing by Seller or Pioneer, respectively, and all such
information provided shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Indemnity_. Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties, any
contractors and their respective Representatives from and against Losses
arising out of an act or omission by Buyer or its authorized Representatives
during any site visits, inspections or Phase I Assessment by Buyer and its
Representatives under _Section 7.4(a)_; _provided_ that this indemnity shall
not, in whole or in part, apply to any Losses which arise as a result of a
pre-existing condition.

 



 

7.5 _Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Seller and Pioneer may
retain copies of any or all of the Records and Buyer will (i) give Seller,
Pioneer and their authorized Representatives reasonable access to all Records,
personnel, accountants, offices and other facilities and properties of or
relating to the Assets, (ii) permit Seller and Pioneer to make and retain such
copies and inspections thereof as Seller or Pioneer may reasonably request,
and (iii) furnish Seller and Pioneer with such financial and operating data
and other information with respect to the performance of the Seller Services
as Seller or Pioneer may from time to time reasonably request, in each case
(A) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed
on Seller, Pioneer or their Affiliates (including under applicable securities
laws) by a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Seller, Pioneer or
their Affiliates, (B) for use in any Proceeding or in order to satisfy audit,
accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation, subpoena or other similar
requirements or (C) to comply with the obligations of Seller and Pioneer under
the Transaction Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
Buyer determines that any such provision of access or information could
violate any Law or Material Contract, or waive any attorney-client privilege,
the Parties shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with
such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. For a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Buyer will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, without first having offered to deliver the
same to Seller and Pioneer, destroy or permit the destruction of any of books
and records relating to the Assets in such Buyers or its Affiliates
possession. This _Section 7.5_ shall not apply to Tax matters, which shall be
governed by _Article 8_.

title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever to use the Pioneer
Marks. Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, but in any case within ninety
(90) days after the Closing, eliminate the Pioneer Marks from the Assets
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, including signage, and provide written
verification thereof to Seller and Pioneer promptly after completing such
removal and change. Buyer shall not do any business or offer any goods or
services under the Pioneer Marks. Buyer shall not send, or cause to be sent,

contains any Pioneer Marks which would or might reasonably be expected to
confuse any Person into believing that Buyer has any right, title, interest or
license to use the Pioneer Marks.

Reasonable Efforts to do, or cause to be done, things reasonably necessary or
desirable, under applicable Law,

financial and operating data and other information, books and contracts
insofar and only insofar as pertaining to the Retained Obligations in the

Hard Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case such
Required Consent Contracts shall not be assigned to Buyer at Closing, there

Contract shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by Seller to Buyer after the
Closing in accordance with the provisions of _Sections 7.11(d)_ and _7.11(e)_
(each, a " _Post-Closing Assigned Contract_ "). All Required Consent Contracts
other than the Post-Closing Assigned Contracts (each, a " _Closing Assigned
Contract_ ") shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by Seller to Buyer at
Closing. Notwithstanding the date on which all of Sellers right, title and

Post-Closing Assigned Contract shall constitute an Asset for all purposes of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

Contract until assigned to Buyer in accordance with _Section 7.11(d)_, (i)

other Third Party that has not already been advanced to Seller by Buyer, or
(B) the exercise by Seller of any remedies available to it under such Post-
Closing Assigned Contract or the taking of any action by Seller to protect its
interest in such Post-Closing Assigned Contract, unless Seller has received
financial and other assurances acceptable to Seller, in its reasonable
discretion, from Buyer with respect to the same) to provide Buyer the benefits
of being a party to such Post-Closing Assigned Contract (to the extent of
Sellers right, title and interest in and to such Post-Closing Assigned
Contract), including by holding all proceeds, benefits and advantages accruing
during such period fully for the benefit of Buyer, it being understood and
agreed that all such proceeds shall be promptly turned over by Seller to Buyer

 



     

 

 



 

when such Post-Closing Assigned Contract is assigned to Buyer, and (ii) Buyer
shall be responsible for performing, and Buyer (or Seller acting at Buyers

such Post-Closing Assigned Contract that would have been applicable to Buyer
had Sellers right, title and interest therein been directly assigned to, and
assumed by, Buyer.

in respect of any past or current insurance policy of Seller or any of its
Affiliates under which the performance of the Seller Services was covered or
the Assets are insured.

the Assumed Obligations after the Closing, in accordance with the Sellers
past payment practices and applicable Law.

 **Article 8 
Tax Matters**

 



 

8.1 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall allocate the purchase price for the Assets (as
determined for applicable U.S. federal Income Tax purposes) among the Assets
in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the " _Allocation_ ") pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 8.1_.

 



 

(b) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver
to Pioneer a draft of the Allocation as determined by one or more independent
appraisals conducted on behalf of Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense (the
" _Proposed Tax Allocation_ "). Pioneer shall have thirty (30) days following
its receipt of the Proposed Tax Allocation to review the Proposed Tax
Allocation and, if Pioneer does not provide Buyer with a notice in writing of
any objections to the Proposed Tax Allocation within such thirty (30) day
period, the Proposed Tax Allocation shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties
(the " _Agreed Tax Allocation_ "). If Pioneer provides written notice of its
objections within such thirty (30) day period, the Parties shall cooperate and
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Proposed Tax
Allocation. If the Parties are unable to resolve their differences and
mutually agree on the Proposed Tax Allocation, each Party shall be permitted
to take an independent position with respect to the Allocation on its
applicable Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) or in connection with any
audit or other Proceeding, or otherwise. If the Parties reach agreement with
respect to such disputes within the thirty (30) day period following Buyers
receipt of such written notice, the Proposed Tax Allocation, as finally agreed
to by the Parties pursuant to this _Section 8.1_, shall become the Agreed Tax
Allocation. Pioneer and Buyer agree not to assert, and will cause their
respective Affiliates not to assert, in connection with any audit or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes or in connection with the filing of any Tax
Return (including IRS Form 8594), any asset values or other items in a manner
inconsistent with the Agreed Tax Allocation, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1)
of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Buyer or Pioneer, nor any of their respective Affiliates, from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
based upon or arising out of the Agreed Tax Allocation and neither Buyer nor
Pioneer, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Authority challenging any position based on or arising out of the Agreed Tax
Allocation.

 



 

(c) Each of Pioneer and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax

 



      

 

 



 

audit, assessment or other Proceeding challenging any position based on or
arising out of the Allocation.

 



 

(d) Adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement shall be
allocated to the particular Asset to which such adjustment relates to the
extent such adjustment relates to such Asset and to the extent that it is, in
the commercially reasonable discretion of Pioneer, possible to do so. Any
adjustment to the Purchase Price not allocated to a specific Asset pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated among the various Assets
on a _pro rata_ basis in proportion to the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated
to such Asset. Buyer will update the Allocation to reflect any adjustments
described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ and such adjustments shall become part of
the Allocation for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

8.2 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.2(b)_, through the end of the day prior to the
Closing Date, Pioneer or Seller, as applicable, shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing all Tax Returns in respect of the Assets which are
required to be filed before the Closing Date and for paying all Taxes due and
owing with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing all Tax Returns
in respect of the Assets required to be filed on or after the Closing Date
(including any Transfer Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed by
Buyer) and paying the Taxes due and owing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that Pioneer or Seller is required by applicable Law to file a Tax
Return with respect to such Taxes (including any Transfer Tax Returns required
by applicable Law to be filed by Pioneer or Seller) on or after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, following Pioneers request, promptly pay to Pioneer or
Seller, as applicable, all such Taxes owed by Buyer pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_ (as determined pursuant to _Section 8.3_). Pioneer
will provide a copy of any Tax Return prepared by Pioneer or Seller, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_ (other than Income Tax Returns)
to Buyer. Any Tax Return prepared by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_
will be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of Pioneer or
Seller, as applicable, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer
shall provide to Pioneer, within fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
filing, all Tax Returns prepared by Buyer for which Pioneer or Seller, as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to have an indemnification obligation
under this Agreement, for Pioneers review and approval of Pioneer or Seller,
respectively, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(c) Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Return which Buyer has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_, Pioneer or Seller, as applicable, shall
pay to Buyer the amount of Taxes owed by Pioneer or Seller, respectively,
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ (as determined pursuant
to _Section 8.3_). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no payment obligation
pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ shall excuse Pioneer or Seller from their
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ if the amount
of Taxes, as ultimately determined on audit or otherwise, for the periods
covered by such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of the payment under this
_Section 8.2(c)_ and (ii) no payment obligation pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
and _Section 8.2(b)_ shall excuse Buyer from its indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_ if the amount of

 



     

 

 



 

Taxes, as ultimately determined on audit or otherwise, for periods covered by
such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of Buyers payment for such period under
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



 

8.3 _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. Any liability attributable to a Straddle
Period (i) in the case of real property, business personal property and other
ad valorem Taxes, shall be apportioned between the portion of such period
ending prior to the Closing Date and the portion beginning on or after the
Closing Date by apportioning such Taxes on a _per diem_ basis and (ii) in the
case of all other Non-Income Taxes, shall be apportioned between the portion
of such period ending at the end of the day prior to the Closing Date and the
portion beginning on the Closing Date on a closing of the books basis,
_provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis shall be apportioned on a _per diem_ basis.

 



 

8.4 _Disputes_. The Parties shall act in good faith to resolve any disputes in
respect of _Section 8.2_ prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return
is required to be filed. If the Parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee; _provided_ ,
that, if any such Tax Return is required to be filed (taking into account
validly obtained extensions) prior to the resolution of such dispute item, and
Pioneer or Seller would reasonably be expected to have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Tax
Return, such Tax Return shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent
with such indemnifying partys position. Buyer, on the one hand, and Pioneer
and Seller, as applicable, on the other hand, shall each provide the other
with all information reasonably necessary to prepare any Tax Return relating
to the Assets.

 



 

8.5 _Responsibility for Tax Audits and Contests_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall notify Pioneer in writing within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt of the notice of any proposed assessment or
commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial Proceeding and of
any Tax demand or claim on Buyer or any of its Affiliates that could
reasonably be expected to result in an indemnification obligation of Pioneer
or Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ ");
_provided_ that failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the
right of Buyers indemnification hereunder, except to the extent Pioneer or
Seller is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission. Such notice shall
contain factual information describing the asserted Tax liability in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability.

 



 

(b) Pioneer shall have the right to control any Proceeding with respect to any
Tax Claim, provided that Pioneer shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed of
the progress of such Proceeding, (ii) allow Buyer (or Buyers counsel) to be
an observer in any meeting related to such Proceeding with the applicable
Governmental Authority at its own cost and expense, and (iii) not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Proceeding that would reasonably
be expected to materially affect the Tax liability of Buyer with respect to
the Assets for any taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the
Closing Date without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that, in the
event Pioneer does not elect to control any such Proceeding, Buyer shall (i)
keep Pioneer reasonably informed of the progress of such Proceeding, (ii)
allow Pioneer (or Pioneers counsel) to be an observer in any meeting related
to such Proceeding with the

 



     

 

 



 

applicable Governmental Authority at its own cost and expense, and (iii) not
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Proceeding without the
consent of Pioneer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer and Pioneer shall each provide the other with
all information reasonably necessary to conduct a Tax audit with respect to
Taxes or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

8.6 _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer, Pioneer, and Seller shall use
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any Proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Assets.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

8.7 _Tax Refunds_. The Parties and their respective Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with obtaining any
refund of Taxes. If a Party receives a refund with respect to any Taxes for
which the other Party is responsible under this Agreement, the Party receiving
the refund shall pay to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days after
such receipt the amount of such refund to which such other Party is entitled
pursuant to the provisions herein.

 



 

8.8 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be liable for any state or local transfer,
sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), including
any costs and expense in connection with filing any necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate to file such Tax Returns and documentation, and if Pioneer or Seller
is required by Law to pay or remit such Transfer Taxes, Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Pioneer or Seller, as applicable, for such Transfer Taxes. The
Parties shall cooperate in establishing the applicability of any exemptions
from Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use their Reasonable
Efforts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by providing access to Tax
Returns and any Retained Records or other relevant documentation) to minimize
the amount of any Transfer Taxes and/or qualify for any applicable exemptions
with respect to Transfer Taxes.

 



 

8.9 _Post-Closing Actions_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Pioneer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) either
(x) retain all records with respect to Tax matters relating to any taxable
period prior to the Closing Date until the day that is ninety (90) days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation, or (y) send such
records described in (x) above to the other Party, and (ii) abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, without
duplication, (i) amend any Tax Return unless required by Law, (ii) initiate
any voluntary disclosure, (iii) agree to extend or waive any statute of
limitation, or (iv) take any Tax position on any Tax Return, in each case,
with respect to Taxes relating to the Assets or the performance of the Seller

 



     

 

 



 

Services for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending prior to the
Closing Date, without prior written consent of Pioneer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

 **Article 9 
Employment Matters**

 



 

9.1 _Seller Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date (or the
applicable Continuing Employees Hire Date, if later), the Continuing
Employees (as defined in _Section 9.4(a)_) shall cease to accrue further
benefits and shall cease to be active participants under the Business Employee
Benefit Plans. Buyer shall not assume any of the Seller Benefits Plans. Seller
and its ERISA Affiliates shall retain and shall be solely responsible for all
Liabilities under the Seller Benefit Plans, and neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates shall have any Liability or responsibility to or under the Seller
Benefit Plans, whether such Liability or responsibility arose before, on or
after the Closing Date.

 



 

9.2 _Pre-Closing Date Claims under Seller Benefit Plans_. To the extent that
an Available Employee was a participant in a Business Employee Benefit Plan,
the Business Employee Benefit Plans shall be responsible for providing welfare
benefits (including medical, hospital, dental, accidental death and
dismemberment, life, disability and other similar benefits) to all
participating Available Employees (and all dependents, beneficiaries,
designees and assignees thereof) for all claims incurred prior to the Hire
Date under and subject to the terms and conditions of such plans. For purposes
of this _Section 9.2_, a claim is incurred with respect to (i) accidental
death and dismemberment, disability, life and other similar benefits when the
event giving rise to such claim occurred and (ii) medical, hospital, dental
and other similar benefits when the services with respect to such claim are
rendered. Seller shall pay out, in accordance with Sellers applicable
policies in effect at that time, accrued and unused paid time off balances, as
of the Hire Date, of the Continuing Employees within thirty (30) days of the
Hire Date, provided that with respect to any Continuing Employee whose Hire
Date is on or after January 1, 2019, such payment shall in all events be made
during the 2019 calendar year.

 



 

9.3 _Offers to Available Employees_. No later than five (5) days after the
Execution Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list of those Business
Employees, in a number not to exceed sixty (60) employees, whom Seller or any
Pioneer Entity has elected to retain and to whom Buyer and its Affiliates will
not make offers of employment in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Excluded Employees_ "). No later than five (5) days
after the Execution Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a letter that includes
a list of all Available Employees (the " _Employee Letter_ "). The Employee
Letter shall include the following data with respect to each Available
Employee: (i) his or her name; (ii) his or her title or position; (iii) status
as exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended; (iv)
primary location of employment; (v) start date or seniority date (as
applicable); (vi) his or her hourly wage rate or annualized base salary, as
applicable; (vii) a description of all commission, bonus or other incentive-
based compensation arrangements applicable to such employee, including, but
not limited to, the target payment amount for the current year and paid in the
current year as of the date hereof; (viii) the number of years of service
credit under each Business Employee Benefit Plan; (ix) whether or not such
employee is on an approved leave of absence; and (x) whether such person is
full-time or part-time. No later than five (5) days after the Execution Date,
Seller

 



     

 

 



 

shall deliver to Buyer a list of those Available Employees in a field engineer
role, in a number not to exceed ten (10) employees, to whom Seller or any
Pioneer Entity may make an offer to retain or employ and to whom Buyer or its
Affiliates may make an offer of employment in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Selective Employees_ "). A Selective
Employee shall have the opportunity to consider offers of employment, if any,
from both a Pioneer Entity and Buyer or its Affiliates. In the event a
Selective Employee accepts an offer from a Pioneer Entity, after such
acceptance, such employee shall be treated as an Excluded Employee for
purposes of this _Article 9_. Any Selective Employee who accepts an
employment offer from Buyer or its Affiliates shall be a Continuing Employee
as defined in this _Article 9_. Seller shall, and shall cause all other
Pioneer Entities to, (i) reasonably assist Buyer in communicating with the
Available Employees regarding potential employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates, (ii) permit Buyer and its Affiliates to interview Available
Employees at reasonable times on Pioneer Entities premises or otherwise and
(iii) not interfere with any negotiations by the Buyer or its Affiliates to
employ any Available Employee or discourage any Available Employee from
accepting employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided that,
any action by Seller or any Pioneer Entity to (i) make employment offers to or
retain the Selective Employees or (ii) share information with Available
Employees regarding severance benefits or otherwise respond to inquiries
regarding termination of employment with Seller or any Pioneer entity shall
not be deemed a violation of this Section. Nothing in this _Article 9_ shall
affect the right of Seller and its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
an Available Employee for any reason or at any time, which termination shall
promptly be communicated to Buyer. Seller shall update the Employee Letter if
any material change in the information required to be included therein
(including removal of or addition to the list of Available Employees) occurs,
with such update to be made within two (2) Business Days after such change.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) on or before December 7, 2018, make written offers of "at will" employment
to those Available Employees whom Buyer selects in its sole discretion, in
each case, such offers setting forth the Closing Date as the employment
commencement date with respect to Available Employees who are not Inactive
Available Employees, with such offers conditioned upon the Closing and
providing such Available Employees at least five (5) Business Days from the
date thereof to either accept or reject such offers. Unless otherwise agreed
to by the Transition Committee, Buyer agrees to make at least six hundred
thirty (630) offers of employment pursuant to this Article 9;

 



 

(ii) on or before December 17, 2018, Buyer shall notify Seller as to each
Available Employee who has accepted employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates as of the date of such notification, which acceptance may be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and effective as of the Closing
Date with respect to Available Employees who are not Inactive Available
Employees, and each Available Employee who has rejected Buyers offer of
employment as of the date of such notification;

 



 

(iii) indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to
all claims by Available Employees and Liabilities with respect thereto, in all

 



     

 

 



 

cases, for violations of applicable Laws by Buyer or its Affiliates relating
to or arising out of Buyers or its Affiliates employment evaluation,
selection and offer process regarding Available Employees and conducted in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this _Article 9_, nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of
Buyer or its Affiliates terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the
Continuing Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably the
title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other
compensation or terms or conditions of employment of such employees.

 



 

9.4 _Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits_. Buyer shall:

 



 

(a) provide to each Available Employee who is actively at work as of the
Closing Date, or is on a previously scheduled and approved (by Seller or its
Affiliates) leave of absence, and who timely accepts an offer of employment
from Buyer made pursuant to this Article 9 and in accordance with the terms of
such offer and timely commences active employment with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (each such Available Employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), during
the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Closing Date (or such shorter
period as the applicable Continuing Employee shall remain continuously
employed with Buyer and its Affiliates), (i) such base salary or hourly wage
rate, as applicable, and cash bonus and including incentive substantially
comparable to that provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate, (ii) subject to _Section 9.4(b)_, immediate
participation in the Buyer or its Affiliates benefit plans as of each
Continuing Employees Hire Date which are provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer or its Affiliates, and (iii) reemployment or hiring, as
applicable, to the Available Employees identified in the Employee Letter as
"Inactive Available Employees" who are not actively at work as of the Closing
Date due to an approved leave of absence, such reemployment or hiring to be
effective as of the date, if any, each such Available Employee has been
cleared for and returns to active employment and to be in a position
substantially comparable to that which such Available Employee has prior to
the commencement of his or her absence from active employment, provided,
however, that such Available Employee must return to active employment within
one hundred fifty (150) days after the Closing or such time period as required
by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) use Reasonable Efforts to cause each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents (including all such employees dependents properly covered
immediately prior to the Hire Date by a group health plan maintained by Seller
or its Affiliates) to be covered under a group health plan maintained by Buyer
or its Affiliate that (i) provides medical, dental and prescription drug
benefits coverage to the Continuing Employee and such eligible dependents
effective immediately upon the Hire Date and (ii) credits or reimburses such
Continuing Employee, for the plan year during which such coverage under such
group health plan begins, with any deductibles or co-payments actually paid by
such Continuing Employee during such year under a group health plan maintained
by Seller or its Affiliates (subject to Buyers or its Affiliates group
health plans deductible and co-payment limits), provided, in all cases, that
(i) Seller provides, or causes to be provided, within a reasonable time after
Closing such information as Buyer reasonably requires to comply with the
foregoing and (ii) if Third Party insurers and administrators do not consent
to the foregoing (after Buyer has used

 



     

 

 



 

Reasonable Efforts to cause Third Party insurers and administrators to consent
to the foregoing), Buyer will be deemed to have used Reasonable Efforts to
comply therewith;

 



 

(c) provide full service credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
severance benefit determination only (other than to the extent that such
credit would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same period
of service, and excepting credit for any defined benefit, money purchase
pension or similar plan and for Buyers or any of its Affiliates equity,
equity-based, or other incentive compensation) under employee benefit plans,
policies and arrangements made available to Continuing Employees by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates on or after the Hire Date which Buyer or its Affiliates
provided its employees on the Closing Date to the same extent such Continuing
Employees service was properly recognized under the analogous type of
Business Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that Continuing Employees
will be eligible for and accrue vacation and other paid time off benefits at
the same rate as a Buyers similarly-situated employee with the same amount of
service a Continuing Employee has under Sellers vacation and/or paid time off
policy; and

 



 

9.5 _Savings Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates, establish or maintain a defined contribution plan
(or plans) and trust (or trusts) intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code in which all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate (" _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") as of the Hire Date. Buyer shall cause
Buyer Savings Plan to accept the direct rollover of electing Continuing
Employees benefits in cash and, if applicable, up to two promissory notes
from the Seller Savings Plan. Buyer shall, if necessary, amend the Buyer
Savings Plan to ensure (or otherwise provide for therein) that the obligations
set forth in this _Section 9.5_ are allowed under the Buyer Savings Plan and
shall do what is administratively required to satisfy the obligations set
forth in this _Section 9.5_.

 



 

9.6 _Seller Offers; Non-Solicitation_. Any Pioneer Entity may make offers of
employment to retain or employ the Excluded Employees and the Selective
Employees. In addition, (i) in the event any Available Employee who receives
an offer of employment from Buyer or its Affiliate rejects such offer of
employment, Seller or any Pioneer Entity may make an offer of employment to
retain or employ such Available Employee, and (ii) Seller or any Pioneer
Entity may make an offer of employment to retain or employ any Available
Employee who does not receive an employment offer from Buyer or its Affiliate.
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make an offer of
employment to any Excluded Employee in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for the one (1) year period after the
Closing and, during the one (1) year period after the Closing, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make an offer of employment to any
employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than as contemplated
pursuant to this Article 9, with whom Buyer or its Affiliates had contact as a
result of this Agreement. During the one (1) year period after the Closing,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make an offer of
employment to any Continuing Employee or other employee of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with whom Seller or its Affiliates had contact as a result of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all cases, offers resulting from
(i) general solicitations made to the applicable market as a whole (e.g.,
Internet and newspaper advertisements or postings) shall not constitute a
violation hereof or (ii) communications between such individual and Seller,
Buyer or their respective Affiliates,

 



     

 

 



 

as applicable, that do not commence until after the applicable Excluded
Employee or Continuing Employee, respectively, has terminated employment with
Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates, as applicable. Further, provided
that either Party consults with and receives advance written permission from
an authorized representative of the other Party, such Party may solicit and
hire any individual whose solicitation and hire would be otherwise prohibited
by this _Section 9.6_.

 



 

9.7 _Post- Closing Date Employment Claims_. In addition to the Liabilities as
set forth in _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all Liability of
any kind or nature involving or related to the employment of the Continuing
Employees by Buyer, including any Liability related to any employee benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its ERISA Affiliates. Except with
respect to Liabilities as set forth in _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_, Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from and against
any and all Liability of any kind or nature or related to the employment by a
Pioneer Entity of any Business Employee, including any Liability related to
any Seller Benefit Plan.

 



 

9.8 _Retention and Advisory Service Arrangements_. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause a retention program to be implemented and certain
advisory services arrangements to be implemented as described on _Schedule
9.8_. Buyer shall not be required to provide any retention with respect to any
Continuing Employee other than pursuant to this _Section 9.8_.

 



 

9.9 _WARN Act; Seller s Obligations_. Seller agrees to provide, or cause its
Affiliates to provide, any notice required under the WARN Act with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" involving the Business Employees that
occurs before the Closing Date. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
harmless from and against any liability, damages, fines or costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) under the WARN Act for any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" involving the Business Employees that occurs before the Closing
Date. No later than December 14, 2018, Seller agrees to provide Buyer the
number of involuntary, not for cause, terminations, if any, since October 1,
2018, with respect to Pioneer Entity employees whose primary duties involved
servicing the Assets; and, on the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer
with the number involuntarily, not for cause, terminations, with respect to
the Business Employees between December 14, 2018 and up to, and including, the
Closing Date.

 



 

9.10 _WARN Act; Buyer s Obligations_. No later than November 26, 2018, Buyer
shall provide Seller sufficient information as is available at that time to
assist in determining whether any employment losses arising in connection with
or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may require
notice or other action by Seller under the WARN Act, including information
regarding the number of employment offers to be made by Buyer pursuant to this
_Article 9_ and the terms and conditions of such employment offers. Buyer
agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, any notice required
under the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
affecting Continuing Employees employment with Buyer and its Affiliates that
occurs after the Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless from and against any liability, damages, fines or costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) under the WARN Act for any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" affecting Continuing Employees that occurs after the Closing
Date or that arises as a result of Buyer or its Affiliates

 



     

 

 



 

making an employment offer to such Continuing Employee, as contemplated in
this _Article 9_, in a manner that constitutes constructive discharge under
the WARN Act.

 



 

9.11 _Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate and work
together with respect to the obligations set forth in this _Article 9_,
including, but not limited to, the coordination of health care coverage,
providing applicable information with respect to deductible and co-payment
amounts under _Section 9.4(b)_, providing applicable service information with
respect to _Section 9.4(c)_, and the retention obligations set forth in
_Schedule 9.8_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the furnishing of information
shall be subject to compliance with applicable Law.

 



 

9.12 _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Nothing herein, expressed or
implied, shall confer upon any Available Employees (or any of their

11.2 _Limitations on Liability_.

 



 

(a) _Threshold_. Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller

(Taxes)), or covenant or agreement of Pioneer, Seller or Buyer, as applicable
(other than any covenant or agreement that by its terms is to be performed
after the Closing), unless the Losses incurred with respect to such claim
exceed $100,000, at which time all Losses (including the initial $100,000 of
Losses) shall be fully indemnified subject to other limitations herein. For
purposes of clarity, Losses disallowed pursuant to this _Section 11.2(a)_
shall not be counted toward the Seller Indemnity Deductible or Buyer Indemnity
Deductible under _Section 11.2(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Indemnity Deductible_. Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the
Seller Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnity under _Section
11.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, as applicable, for Losses with respect

Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties in _Section
4.6_ (Taxes) and _Section 5.9_ (Taxes)) until the aggregate amount of all
such Losses exceeds (i) with respect to indemnities to Buyer Indemnified
Parties, $11,440,000 (the " _Buyer Indemnity Deductible_ ") and (ii) with
respect to indemnities to Seller Indemnified Parties, $16,000,000 (the "
_Seller Indemnity Deductible_ "), and the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall only be entitled to indemnity for
the aggregate amount of such Losses in excess of the Buyer Indemnity
Deductible or Seller Indemnity Deductible, as applicable, subject to the other
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Liability Cap_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) Seller and Pioneer, collectively, shall not
be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section
11.1(a)(i)_, in the aggregate, for an amount of Losses (other than Losses for
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties in _Section
4.6_ (Taxes) and _Section 5.9_ (Taxes)) exceeding $60,000,000; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that in no event shall Seller and Pioneer, collectively, be
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder, in the
aggregate, for an amount of Losses exceeding $400,000,000 (the " _Seller
Indemnity Cap_ ") and (ii) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Seller
Indemnified Parties under _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, in the aggregate, for an
amount of Losses (other than Losses for Fundamental Representations) exceeding
$42,900,000; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that in no event shall Buyer be
required to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties hereunder, in the

relating to or arising out of the Retained Obligations or Assumed Obligations,
as applicable, shall not be subject to the Seller Indemnity Cap or the Buyer
Indemnity Cap.

 



 

(d) _Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 11.2(d)_, the
Liability of Buyer, Seller and Pioneer for any breach of any of their
respective representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing. The representations and

 



     

 

 



 

warranties contained in this Agreement, and the Liabilities of Buyer, Seller
and Pioneer for breach thereof, shall terminate on the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such
Liability of Seller or Pioneer for any breach of (i) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing Date indefinitely and (ii) the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.6_ (Taxes), _Section 5.9_
(Taxes) and _Section 4.12_ (Employee Benefits) shall survive until the
applicable statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days. All Liabilities with
respect to a failure to comply with the covenants and agreements of Buyer,
Seller and Pioneer contained in this Agreement that, (x) by their nature, are
to be performed prior to or at Closing, shall not survive the Closing, and (y)
by their nature, are to be performed after the Closing, shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
claim made by any Party must be made in a Notice delivered to the other
Parties (or not at all) on or prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period, if any, of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement; _provided_ , that the survival periods shall be extended
automatically to include any time period necessary to resolve a specific claim
for indemnification which was made before expiration of the applicable
survival period but not resolved prior to its expiration; and _provided_ ,
further, that any such extension shall apply only as to claims asserted and
not so resolved within the survival period. The Liability of Buyer, Seller and
Pioneer under each of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the applicable
date of expiration set forth herein.

 



 

(e) _Subrogation_. If Buyer, Seller or Pioneer is required to make any payment
to any Indemnified Party under this _Article 11_, such Party shall be
entitled to subrogation and is hereby granted subrogation rights with respect
to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party (i) under any insurance
maintained by, or for the benefit of, the applicable Indemnified Party or (ii)
to any other claims of the applicable Indemnified Party against any Third
Party with respect to the Losses giving rise to such payment obligation, but
in each case, only to the extent of such required payment.

 



 

(f) _Schedule Supplement_. From time to time prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto to
correct any matter that would otherwise constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained herein solely to the extent
that Seller first has Knowledge of such breach after the Execution Date (each
a " _Schedule Supplement_"), and each such Schedule Supplement shall be
deemed to be incorporated into and supplement and amend the Disclosure
Schedules as of the Closing Date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such
Schedule Supplement shall be disregarded for purposes of, and shall not
affect, the determination of the failure or satisfaction of Buyers condition
to Closing set forth in _Section 10.1(a)_.

 



 

(g) _Rescission_. Seller, Pioneer and Buyer acknowledge that after the Closing
the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be
adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or for any other claim arising in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer,
Seller and Pioneer waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



     

 

 



 

(h) _Knowledge_. In the event Buyer has Knowledge of any matter that causes or
would be likely to cause any of Sellers or Pioneers representations or
warranties to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect, Buyer shall promptly
give notice of such matter to Seller and Pioneer. If Buyer fails to notify
Seller of any such matter, then, following the Closing, Buyer shall not be
entitled to claim that Seller or Pioneer, as applicable, breached any
representation or warranty as a result of such matter.

 



 

(i) _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of calculating Losses under this
_Article 11_ with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty
contained in _Article 4_, _Article 5_ or _Article 6_, any "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifications in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded (other than _Section 4.15(b)_ and _Section
6.13(b_).

 



 

(j) _Calculation of Losses_. Losses shall be determined net of any (i) Third
Party insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or that
would reasonably be expected to be received or receivable by the Indemnified
Party through Reasonable Efforts in respect of or related to the event, cause
or condition giving rise to such Losses (the " _Cause_ ") and (ii) amounts
actually recovered from Third Parties or that would reasonably be expected to
be received or receivable by the Indemnified Party through Reasonable Efforts
or over time with respect to the Cause, in each case of _clause (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , taking into account any expenses to obtain such proceeds with respect
to such Losses. Buyer, Seller and Pioneer shall, and shall cause the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, to, use
Reasonable Efforts to collect any amounts available under such Third Party
insurance coverage and from any Person alleged to have responsibility. If a
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, receives
an amount under Third Party insurance coverage or from a Third Party with
respect to Losses that were the subject of indemnification under this _Article
11_ at any time subsequent to indemnification provided hereunder, then such
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall
promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party to the extent of the net
amount received, taking into account any expenses to obtain such amounts.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Losses shall not include
any Non-Recoverable Damages.

 



 

11.3 _Procedures_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Article 8_, claims for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claim_. If any Party entitled to seek indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives Notice of the assertion
or commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a Third
Party (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall as soon as
reasonably practicable (i) notify the Party obligated to indemnify such
Indemnified Party pursuant hereto (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third
Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a Notice (" _Claim
Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party
Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), and
the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this
Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the
right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or
omission.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Indemnifying Party_. In the case of a claim for indemnification based
upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
from its receipt of the relevant Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party
whether it admits or denies its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party admits liability
with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim only if
such Indemnifying Party provides Notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at its
sole cost and expense within thirty (30) days from the Indemnifying Partys
receipt of the relevant Claim Notice. The Indemnified Party is authorized,
prior to and during such 30 day period, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party of its desire to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claims in accordance with the
foregoing, then such Indemnifying Party (the " _Assuming Indemnifying Party_
") shall have the right and the obligation to diligently defend, at its sole
cost and expense such Third Party Claim, with counsel reasonably selected by
the Assuming Indemnifying Party, to a final conclusion or settlement at the
discretion of the Assuming Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section
11.3(b)_. The Assuming Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the Assuming Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that such consent shall not be
required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional
general release by the Third Party asserting the claim to all Indemnified
Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not
contain or impose any obligation, limitation, Liability, sanction or
restriction upon the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or the conduct of any
business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If requested by the
Assuming Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost
and expense of the Assuming Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Assuming
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Assuming Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any
related reasonable counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party
Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim controlled by the Assuming Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
11.3(b)_, and except in accordance with the preceding sentence the Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 



 

(c) _Indemnified Party_. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 11.3(b)_ or if the Indemnifying Party so elects to
defend the Indemnified Party but fails to diligently prosecute or settle such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend,
and be reimbursed for its reasonable costs and expenses (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard
to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend the Third Party Claim
in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be
sought hereunder, without the

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 11.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

 



 

(d) _Direct Claim_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt Notice thereof,
but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
obtains actual knowledge of such Direct Claim; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_
failure to timely provide such Notice shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission. Such
Notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all written background material relevant
thereto and shall indicate an estimate of the actual amount of Losses that
have been sustained and the projected amount of Losses that may be sustained
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty
(30) days within which to respond in writing and to either accept or reject
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

11.4 _Waiver of Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE
CONTRARY, NEITHER BUYER, SELLER, PIONEER NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL
BE LIABLE HEREUNDER TO ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY NON-RECOVERABLE DAMAGES,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH NON-RECOVERABLE DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED IN ANY
ACTION BY A THIRD PARTY AGAINST SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY AND SUCH NON-
RECOVERABLE DAMAGES ARE OTHERWISE INDEMNIFIABLE OR RECOVERABLE LOSSES UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

11.5 _Waivers and Disclaimers_.

 



 

(a) _Defects_. The Assets are being conveyed and assigned to and accepted by
Buyer in their "as is, where is" condition and state of repair, and with all
faults and defects, without any representation, or warranty of any kind or
nature, express, implied or statutory, including warranties of marketability,
quality, condition, conformity to samples, merchantability and/or fitness for
a particular purpose, all of which are expressly disclaimed and negated by
Seller and Pioneer and waived by Buyer (other than the representations and
warranties of Seller and Pioneer set forth in _Article 4_ and _Article 5_,
respectively).

 



 

(b) _Additional Disclaimers_. OTHER THAN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLER AND PIONEER SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE 4_ AND _ARTICLE 5_, SELLER AND
PIONEER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND NEGATE, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY LIABILITY
OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER AND PIONEER FOR, (I) ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, (II) ANY STATEMENT OR
INFORMATION ORALLY OR IN WRITING MADE OR COMMUNICATED TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS

 



     

 

 



 

REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING (1) ANY STATEMENT OR INFORMATION ORALLY OR IN
WRITING MADE OR COMMUNICATED TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES BY ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF SELLER, PIONEER OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR (2) AS TO THE
ACCURACY, MATERIALITY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA OR RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO
BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS.

 



 

11.6 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except for any claims seeking specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the failure of any
party to perform its covenants hereunder (whether before or after Closing),
the indemnification remedies set forth in this _Article 11_, _Section
7.4(b)_, _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.9_ and this
_Section 11.6_ shall, from and after the Closing, constitute the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to any and all claims (whether
arising before or after Closing) relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, the Assets or Sellers or Pioneers ownership or operation of the
Assets or the condition of the Assets, including statutory or other claims
arising under any Law.

 



 

11.7 _Express Negligence Rule_. THE INDEMNIFICATION AND WAIVER PROVISIONS IN
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON
(INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES
THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OF
THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION. BUYER, SELLER AND PIONEER
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND
IS CONSPICUOUS.

 



 

11.8 _Tax Treatment of Post-Closing Payments_. The Parties agree that any
payments made by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this _Article 11_
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Cash
Consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 **Article 12

12.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

12.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 12.1_, subject to
_Section 12.2(b)_, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force
or effect (except for the provisions of _Section 1.2_, _Section 7.4(b)_,
_Section 7.8_, _Section 11.4_, this _Article 12_, _Article 13_, and
_Article 14_ and any applicable definitions set forth in _Section 1.1_, all
of which shall survive and continue in full force and effect indefinitely);
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
affected by a termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) Seller or Pioneer has elected to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(d)_ or (ii) Buyer has elected to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)_, then, in the case of
_clause (i)_ Buyer shall pay to Seller, and in the case of _clause (ii)_ ,
Seller shall pay to Buyer, in each case, in immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the applicable payee, an aggregate amount
equal to $20,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") for the sole account and use
of the applicable payee, and the payment by Buyer to Seller, or Seller to
Buyer, as applicable, of the Termination Fee shall

 



     

 

 



 

constitute liquidated damages hereunder, which remedy shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the applicable Party receiving the Termination
Fee, except that any remedies of Seller and Pioneer pursuant to or in
connection with _Section 7.4(b)_ and _Section 7.8_ of this Agreement, or the
Confidentiality Agreement, in each case, expressly survive any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_, all other remedies (including
specific performance) being expressly waived by the Parties. Seller, Pioneer
and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (A) the Termination Fee is a fair and
reasonable estimate by the Parties of the actual damages of the applicable
payee pursuant to _clause (i)_ or _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 12.2(b)_
and (B) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

 



 

12.3 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the other Parties
would be damaged irreparably if the obligations of a Party under this
Agreement to be performed at or in connection with the Closing are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in lieu of termination of this Agreement
as contemplated in _Section 12.1_, each Party may seek to enforce
specifically the obligations of the other Parties under this Agreement or in
connection with the Closing.

will be determined exclusively in a state or federal district court located in
Dallas County, Texas. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN SUCH
COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON-CONVENIENS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH
DISPUTE.

14.2 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part hereof
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any assignment made
without such consent shall be void _ab initio_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after Closing, any Party shall be entitled to assign their rights under this

shall not release the assigning Party from its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

14.3 _Rights of Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement or
in any other Transaction Document is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon or give any Person, other than the Parties (and their respective
successors and permitted assigns), or the Parties respective related
Indemnified Parties hereunder, any right or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; _provided_ that only a Party (and
its respective successors and permitted assigns) will have the right to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or on behalf of any
of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not be obligated to do so).

 



 

14.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more

Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

14.6 _Disclosure Schedules_. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the respective

or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Each disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
qualify all representations and warranties of Seller or Pioneer, as
applicable, notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross reference in the
Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by Seller
or Pioneer, as applicable, in and of itself, that such information is material
to or outside the Ordinary Course of the Business of Seller or Pioneer, as
applicable, or required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules.

 



     

 

 



 

14.7 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, and terms and conditions may be waived, only by a duly authorized
agreement in writing which makes reference to this Agreement executed by each
Party.

 



 

14.8 _Publicity_. In addition to the obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement, prior to Closing, all press releases or other public announcement
of any nature whatsoever relating to the existence of this Agreement, the
contents hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, and the method of the
release for publication thereof, shall be subject to the prior written consent
of Buyer, Seller and Pioneer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall restrict
disclosures by Buyer, Seller, Pioneer, or their Affiliates (a) to the extent
that such disclosures are required by applicable securities or other Laws or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
disclosing Party or its Affiliates or (b) to Governmental Authorities and
Third Parties holding preferential rights to purchase, rights of consent or
other rights that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers,
amendments or terminations of such rights, or seek such consents. The Parties
agree that neither Buyer, Seller nor Pioneer will have an adequate remedy at
law if any of the foregoing Persons violate (or threaten to violate) any of
the terms of this _Section 14.8_. In such event, Buyer, Seller or Pioneer, as
applicable, shall have the right, in addition to any other it may have, to
obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threaten breach of the
terms of this _Section 14.8_.

 



 

14.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In addition, any such
invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a provision that comes
closest to the business objective intended by such invalid or unenforceable
provision without being invalid or unenforceable itself.

 



 

14.10 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to
whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any other provisions
hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

 ** _EXHIBIT B_**

 



 

 **Pressure Pumping Services Agreement**

     

 

 



 

 ** _PRESSURE PUMPING SERVICES AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This Pressure Pumping Services Agreement (this " **Agreement** "), effective
as of the Effective Date (as defined in _Article 25_), is between Pioneer
Natural Resources USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place
of business at 5205 North OConnor Blvd., Suite 200, Irving, Texas 75039 ("
**Company** "), and ProPetro Services, Inc., a Texas corporation with its
principal place of business at 1706 S. Midkiff, Bldg. B, Midland, Texas 79701
(" **Contractor** "). Company and Contractor are sometimes hereinafter
individually referred to as a " **Party** ," and collectively as the "
**Parties**."

 



 

WHEREAS, Company is the operator of certain oil and gas wells drilled and to
be drilled in certain areas;

 



 

WHEREAS, Company desires Contractor to provide dedicated hydraulic fracturing
Fleets (as defined in _Article 3_) to Company for the performance of fracture
stimulation pumping services, including all pump down operations associated
therewith, and provision of associated products in connection with Companys
operations (the " **Services** "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, Contractor desires to perform, and represents that it has fully-
trained personnel capable of performing Services as required by Company;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the covenants and promises herein
contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Master Service/Sales Agreement_. This Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of that certain Amended and Restated Master Service/Sales Agreement by and between Company and Contractor dated May 16, 2016 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the " **MSSA** ") which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the MSSA and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

 



 

2. _Term_.

 



 

(a) The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall
continue for a period ending December 31, 2028 (the " **Term** "); provided,
that Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
terminate this Agreement (a) in whole or (b) in part, with respect to one or
more Fleets, effective as of December 31 of each of the calendar years 2022,
2024 and 2026 by providing written notice thereof to Contractor not later than
July 1 of such calendar year. Following receipt of written notice from Company
to commence initial mobilization, Contractor shall be responsible for the
mobilization and demobilization of Contractors personnel and equipment and
the performance of the Services in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties
anticipate that such commencement will occur on or about January 1, 2019 ("
**Commencement Date** ").

 



 

(b) This Agreement supersedes and replaces that certain Pressure Pumping
Services Agreement by and between Company and Contractor dated January 23,
2017 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the " **Existing PPSA**
") in all respects effective as of the Effective Date. Except as provided in
this _Article 2(b)_, commencing on the Effective Date, (i) the

     

 

 



 

Parties hereby agree to terminate the Existing PPSA, (ii) Contractor shall
cease providing services to Company, and Company will cease obtaining services
from Contractor, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Existing PPSA, and (iii) Contractor will commence providing Services to
Company, and Company will commence obtaining Services from Contractor,
pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Neither
Party will be deemed to have waived, or to have released the other Party from,
any claim, issue or dispute arising, becoming known or discovered or asserted
after the Effective Date but relating to a Partys performance or
nonperformance under the Existing PPSA. The resolution of any such claim,
issue or dispute will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of
the Existing PPSA. In addition, Company will remain obligated to pay to
Contractor all amounts properly payable by Company pursuant to the Existing
PPSA that, in accordance with the regular invoice and payment process, had not
been invoiced to or paid by Company as of the Effective Date. The terms of the
Existing PPSA shall survive its termination and remain in full effect for
purposes of the matters described in this _Article 2(b)_.

 



 

3. _Pricing and Scope of Work_.

 



 

(a) Contractor shall perform the Services in accordance with each applicable
work order or other instrument used by Company to authorize the performance of
the Services and Contractors net price book that is mutually agreed to
between Company and Contractor (the " **Net Price Book** "). Rates for items
not included in the Net Price Book or expressly provided herein shall be
agreed upon in writing by the Parties. The Net Price Book will be subject to
adjustments as set forth in _Article 4_. Company shall not be liable for any
markup by Contractor on goods or services provided by any third party
subcontractor or supplier of Contractor. Additionally, Company shall not be
liable for any detention, demurrage, or non-utilization charges incurred by
Contractor in connection with trucking services provided by Contractor or its
subcontractors in furtherance of the Services, except if and to the extent
that any such detention, demurrage, or non-utilization charges are directly
caused by any member of the Company Group (as such term is defined in the
MSSA), as determined by Company in good faith.

 



 

(b) Beginning on the Commencement Date, Contractor shall deliver eight (8)
hydraulic fracturing fleets to Company to perform the Services (" **Fleets**
"), with such Fleets dedicated exclusively to Company throughout the Term. For
each Fleet, there shall be (i) sufficient personnel and equipment capable of
sustaining maximum treating pressures of 10,000 pounds per square inch and
maximum pump rates of 100 barrels per minute for each well in the performance
of the Services, (ii) on-site storage equipment capable of holding a minimum
of 5,000,000 pounds of proppant, and (iii) sufficient personnel and equipment
capable of providing all pump down operations required in connection with the
Services. If Companys job design for a well requires treating pressures or
pump rates in excess of the amounts set forth above, Company will provide
Contractor sufficient notice to allow Contractor to secure any additional
equipment and materials that may be necessary to satisfy such requirements.
Contractor will be solely responsible for the operation of the equipment, and
the equipment shall remain under the control of Contractor at all times.
Contractor shall provide trained and qualified personnel to perform the
Services. In satisfying its Fleet obligations under this Agreement, Contractor
will have the sole right to determine the equipment included in each Fleet,
subject to (i) Contractors compliance with the requirements of this
Agreement, and (ii) Contractor consulting with Company within a reasonable
period of time (but at least ten (10) days) before changing the then-current
configuration or components of any Fleet.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Company hereby grants Contractor a right of first offer (" **ROFO** ")
with respect to any coiled tubing services that may be required by Company as
part of the Services (the " **Coiled Tubing Services** "), subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this _Article 3(c)_. If Company requires
any Coiled Tubing Services, then Company shall provide Contractor with written
notice thereof, identifying the location(s), time period(s) and other
particulars with respect to the Coiled Tubing Services that Company requires
(the " **ROFO Offer** "). If Contractor has sufficient coiled tubing equipment
available to perform Coiled Tubing Services at the location(s) and during the
time period(s) required per a ROFO Offer, then Contractor shall provide such
Coiled Tubing Services to Company under the terms of this Agreement and the
Pricing Agreement by and between Company and Contractor effective as of the
Effective Date. However, if Contractor does not have such equipment available
to perform Coiled Tubing Services at the location(s) and during the time
period(s) required per a ROFO Offer, then that ROFO Offer shall be of no
further force or effect, the ROFO granted herein shall automatically terminate
and be null and void as to the subject Coiled Tubing Services, and Company may
procure such Coiled Tubing Services from any third party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Article 3(c)_: (i) Contractor
will not have a ROFO with respect to any Coiled Tubing Services if, at the
time that Company wishes to make a ROFO Offer to Contractor, Contractor is not
in compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) the ROFO granted
herein shall automatically terminate and be null and void with respect to any
and all Coiled Tubing Services that Company requires after such date on which
Contractor has failed to meet any of the key performance indicators for the
Coiled Tubing Services that are set forth in _Exhibit A_.

 



 

4. _Periodic Pricing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of such date that is six (6) months after the Effective Date
and every six (6) months thereafter during the Term (each a " **Price
Adjustment Date** "), Contractor shall apply a price adjustment mechanism that
is mutually agreed to between Company and Contractor (the " **PAM** ") to the
materials and services that compose the then-current standard job price that
is mutually agreed to between Company and Contractor (the " **Standard Job
Price** "). Contractor, in consultation with Company, shall make adjustments
to the unit prices of line items in the then-current Net Price Book necessary
to achieve a revised Standard Job Price reflective of the PAM with the
resulting adjustments set forth in a revised Net Price Book to be prepared by
Contractor. Such adjustments shall be effective retroactively and
prospectively for all Services that are commenced during the applicable six
(6)-month period. Contractor shall submit the revised Net Price Book and a
revised Standard Job Price to Company, along with a pricing memorandum in a
form and format agreed upon by the Parties that details the application of the
PAM, in each case by the fifteenth (15th) day following the applicable Price
Adjustment Date.

 



 

(b) If a Party (i) implements new technology with respect to the Services that
materially improves the quality, efficiency, capability, safety, or other
performance metrics of the Fleets hereunder, or (ii) identifies new technology
that it believes would, if implemented with respect to the Services, achieve
such improvements, then that Party will provide the other Party notice
thereof. Promptly thereafter, the Parties will conduct good-faith negotiations
(i) if such technology is not yet implemented, to agree to a commercially
reasonable plan to acquire and implement such new technology; and (ii) to make
equitable adjustments to the Net Price Book, the composition of a Fleet, and
the minimum Efficiency Rate and Per Pad Stage Attainment Rate to account for
such improvements.

 



     

 

 



 

5. _Invoicing; Credits_.

 



 

(a) Contractor shall issue invoices to Company for the Services on a per-well
basis and otherwise in accordance with the MSSA.

 



 

(b) Without limiting Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement or at
law or in equity, Company may deduct any amount that Company determines in
good faith is owed by Contractor to Company under this Agreement (each such
deduction, a " **Credit** ") from any charges invoiced by Contractor hereunder
or against other amounts owed by Company to Contractor under this Agreement.
Company shall notify Contractor in advance of applying any Credit against any
charges invoiced by Contractor hereunder or against other amounts owed by
Company to Contractor under this Agreement. Such Credits shall not limit or
affect any right of Company to recover any damages incurred by Company as a
result of any failure by Contractor to perform the Services or any other
obligation contemplated by this Agreement. Credits shall not expire and may be
held by the Company until fully utilized. Upon the expiration or any
termination of this Agreement, any remaining Credits shall be paid or credited
to Company, at Companys election and in its sole discretion.

 



 

6. _Option for Additional Fleets_. Notwithstanding anything contained in _Article 3_ above, the Parties agree that in consideration of U.S. $10 paid by Company to Contractor, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Company has the option, but not the obligation, to add additional incremental Fleets from Contractor (each, an " **Additional Fleet** "), but not more than two (2) Additional Fleets in any calendar year, which Additional Fleets shall be under the same terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement. Such option shall expire on December 31, 2022. Company shall provide Contractor with nine (9) months written notice of its election to exercise its option to add an Additional Fleet. In addition, during the first year of the Term, Company may add one (1) additional incremental Fleet upon at least sixty (60) days written notice to Contractor that will consist of Contractors then available equipment and will not constitute a new order (the " **First Year Additional Fleet** "). The Parties shall work together in good faith to determine mobilization dates for the First Year Additional Fleet and each Additional Fleet, as applicable; provided, however, Company may postpone the agreed mobilization date for the First Year Additional Fleet by a period of time designated by Company (such postponement period not to exceed thirty (30) days, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties), provided that Company notifies Contractor in writing of such postponement at least thirty (30) days prior to the original agreed mobilization date for the First Year Additional Fleet. Commencing on their applicable mobilization dates, the First Year Additional Fleet and each Additional Fleet shall be considered a Fleet for all purposes hereof.

 



 

7. _Efficiency Rate; Non-Productive Time; Equipment Mobilization_.

 



 

(a) Contractor shall be capable of performing the Services in accordance with
the requirements of this Agreement on a twenty-four (24) hour basis, seven (7)
days a week. For each well where Contractor is performing the Services,
Contractor shall perform the Services at an efficiency rate of at least ninety
percent (90%) (" **Efficiency Rate** "), which shall be calculated as set
forth in _Exhibit B_; provided, however, that for purposes of this _Article
7_, neither Fleet Mobilization Time (defined below) nor any time period that
the Parties may agree to, including a holiday or time period associated with a
weather event, shall be Company or Contractor Non-Productive Time (defined
below). " **Fleet Mobilization Time** " is the amount of time, as is mutually
agreed to between Company and Contractor, that each Fleet is allowed to move
between pads in order to set up and be Mobilized on Location. A Fleet will be

 



      

 

 



 

" **Mobilized on Location** " when the Fleet is fully mobilized on a Company
well-site and fully capable of performing the Services.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Article 7(a)_ , (i) each hour or fractional hour that
Contractor does not perform the Services when a Fleet is Mobilized on Location
(as defined below) for any reason, other than White Space or an Idle Period
(each defined below), that is attributable to the sole fault of any member of
the Company Group, will be " **Company Non-Productive Time** " or " **Company
NPT** " and (ii) each hour or fractional hour that Contractor does not perform
the Services for any reason not attributable to Company NPT will be "
**Contractor Non-Productive Time** " or " **Contractor NPT**."

 



 

8. _Stage Attainment Rate_. Upon the completion of each pad, each Contractor Fleet shall be required to achieve a Stage Attainment Rate (as defined below) of ninety-five (95%) (the " **Per Pad Stage Attainment Rate** "). " **Stage Attainment Rate** " shall be determined as follows:

 



 

First, calculate the target number of Stages to be attained for a day of
Services by a Fleet:

 



 

![](g422261ke21i001.jpg)

 



 

Second, compare the number of Stages actually attained by that Fleet to the
target number of Stages to have been attained on that day.

 



 

![](g422261ke21i002.jpg)

 



 

Third, upon that Fleets completion of Services for the subject pad, average
the daily Stage Attainment Rates applicable to such pad. An example
calculation of the Stage Attainment Rate is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

 



 

" **Pump** Time" means the planned time to complete a Stage, given the fluid
volume and pump rate for such Stage, according to Companys design.

 



 

A " **Stage** " means the perforation of a portion of the well casing and
injection of fluid into the perforated zone, according to Companys design. A
Stage is completed when a plug is set that completely seals off the portion of
the well casing that was perforated and into which fracturing fluid was pumped
according to Companys design.

 



 

" **Switch-Over Time** " means the time that Company allots to Contractor to
move its equipment between wells, according to Companys design.

 



 

9. _Materials and Logistics_. Company shall have the right, in Companys sole discretion and upon at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to Contractor, to supply all or a portion of the proppant, proppant trucking, coiled tubing services, friction reducer, high viscosity friction reducer, surfactant, and diesel fuel and trucking (collectively, the " **Company Provided Materials** ") to Contractor for purposes of Contractors performance of the Services, as well as the right to have Contractor provide such materials. In the event that Company exercises its right to supply any of the Company Provided Materials, Contractor shall make corresponding equitable adjustments to the unit prices contained in the then-current and each subsequent Net Price Book 

 



     

 

 



 

(and not simply the elimination of the applicable line item(s)). As of the
Effective Date, Company elects to provide all proppant. At Companys election,
Company reserves the right to supply any other materials in furtherance of the
performance of the Services; provided, however, that Companys right to supply
any other materials in furtherance of the performance of the Services shall
not apply if and to the extent that Contractor is expressly required to
purchase any quantity of any such materials under any agreements that have
been assigned by Company or Pioneer Natural Resources Pumping Services LLC to
ProPetro Holding Corp. pursuant to that Purchase and Sale Agreement by and
among Company, Pioneer Natural Resources Pumping Services LLC and ProPetro
Holding Corp., dated November 12, 2018 (the " **PSA** "), in each case per the
express terms of such agreements as of the date of their assignment by Company
(and not as they may be later amended or otherwise modified).

 



 

10. _White Space_.

 



 

(a) " **White Space** " means any full day or period of consecutive full days
during which a Fleet is capable of performing the Services in accordance with
this Agreement, but is not scheduled by Company to perform the Services. With
respect to each Fleet, White Space does not include: (i) the first ten (10)
days of Fleet Mobilization Time per quarter; (ii) any Fleet Mobilization Time
to the extent Contractors time to move such Fleet between pads and set up and
be Mobilized on Location exceeds seventy-two (72) hours; (iii) any time period
that a Fleet is Mobilized on Location; or (iv) any time period during which a
Fleet performs services for a third party customer of Contractor. The Parties
shall work together in good faith to maintain a schedule for the Services that
minimizes, to the extent commercially reasonable, the potential for White
Space.

 



 

(b) Company shall advise Contractor of any anticipated days of White Space for
a Fleet as soon as is reasonably practicable. Company shall provide to
Contractor at least seventy-two (72) hours notice of the date for the
affected Fleet to resume its performance of the Services following the
anticipated White Space (the " **Return Date** "). Unless otherwise expressly
notified by Company in writing, the affected Fleet shall resume its
performance of the Services on such Return Date.

 



 

11. _Idle Periods_.

 



 

(a) Should Company elect to idle a Fleet, Company may issue a written notice
to Contractor regarding such election (an " **Idle Period Notice** "). Any
time period that a Fleet is idled pursuant to an Idle Period Notice is an "
**Idle Period**." An Idle Period shall not be considered White Space. Upon
receipt of an Idle Period Notice, Contractor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to employ the affected Fleet in work with a substitute customer during
any such anticipated Idle Period.

 



 

(b) During an Idle Period, Company shall not enter into any agreement with a
third party to provide stimulation pumping services that could otherwise be
timely performed by an idled Fleet in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. If Company wishes to re-activate a Fleet idled pursuant to _Article
11(a)_ , Company shall provide at least sixty (60) days written notice in
advance of the Return Date for such Fleet in order to allow Contractor to
timely secure personnel and equipment suitable for the Services. In the event
that Contractor fails to achieve the Return Date set forth in a notice issued
by Company in accordance with this _Article 11(b)_ , Contractor shall be
liable to Company for charges in an amount to be mutually agreed by Company
and Contractor (such amount, the " **Return Date Overage Amount** ").

 



     

 

 



 

Following Contractors receipt of notice from Company of a Return Date
applicable to an idled Fleet, Contractor shall not enter in any commitment as
to such Fleet that extends beyond the designated Return Date. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to Contractors receipt of notice by
Company of a Return Date for an idled Fleet, Contractor has entered into a
binding agreement with a third party for such Fleet for a term that extends
beyond the Return Date specified by Company, (i) Contractor shall have no
liability to Company for any Return Date Overage Amounts applicable to days
for which such Fleet is so bound; and (ii) Company may enter into an agreement
with a third party to perform services that would otherwise be provided by
such Fleet.

 



 

12. _Reservation Periods_. Within ten (10) business days following the beginning of each calendar quarter during the Term, Contractor shall determine the total number of days attributable to (i) White Space for all Fleets that were not subject to an Idle Period during the preceding calendar quarter (the " **White Space Period** "), and (ii) Idle Period(s) for each Fleet that was subject to an Idle Period. 

 



 

13. _Venue_. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the United States federal and state courts located in the State of Texas with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, and each of the Parties agrees that any action with respect to any such dispute, controversy, or claim will be determined exclusively in a state or federal district court located in Dallas County, Texas. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM BROUGHT BY IT OR BROUGHT BY THE OTHER PARTY THAT ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

14. _Remedies_. 

 



 

(a) If Contractor fails to perform any Services in accordance with this
Agreement, Company may exercise any one or more of the following remedies:

 



 

(i) provide the affected Services itself or procure such Services from an
alternate source, in which case Contractor shall reimburse Company for the
costs incurred by Company in providing or procuring such Services to the
extent that such costs exceed the applicable Net Price Book prices for such
Services (even if such Net Price Book prices were not paid by Company);

 



 

(ii) require Contractor to procure the affected Services from a third party
selected by Company and have such third party provide such Services to Company
at no additional cost to Company;

 



 

(iii) require Contractor to reimburse Company for any amounts paid by Company
to Contractor with respect to the affected Services; and

 



 

(iv) require Contractor to take any other actions that the Company deems to be
necessary to timely address Contractors failure to perform, which may include
(1) re-performing the relevant job, (2) supplementing the affected Fleet or
crew, and (3) replacing the affected Fleet or crew.

 



     

 

 



 

Any period(s) of time during which is Company is exercising any of the
remedies set forth in this _Article 14(a)_ shall not be considered Company
NPT, Contractor NPT, White Space, or an Idle Period for the Fleet(s) whose
performance Company is seeking to remedy.

 



 

(b) The rights and remedies of Company provided in this _Article 14_ are not
exclusive, and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided under
this Agreement or at law or in equity, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary.

 



 

15. _Termination_. 

 



 

(a) Either Party may terminate this Agreement by delivery of a written
termination notice to the other Party, in the event the other Party becomes
insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy, has a petition in involuntary
bankruptcy filed against such Party (which petition is not terminated within
sixty (60) days of filing), or makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors. Such termination shall be effective immediately upon delivery of
written notice of termination.

 



 

(b) Company may, by delivery of a written termination notice to Contractor:

 



 

(i) Terminate this Agreement with respect to a particular Fleet if such Fleet
fails to achieve the Per Pad Stage Attainment Rate (A) for three (3)
consecutive pads or (B) for three (3) pads within any rolling six (6)-pad
period. Such termination shall be effective upon the date specified in
Companys termination notice to Contractor and Company shall not have any
termination liability to the Contractor under this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) Terminate this Agreement in its entirety in the event of a Change in
Control. " **Change in Control** " means the occurrence of any of the
following events:

 



 

(1) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 of the Securities Act of 1934) of securities of ProPetro Holding Corp.,
a Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "), that, together with securities held
by such person, constitutes 50% or more of either (x) the then outstanding
shares of common stock of Parent (the " **Outstanding Parent Stock** ") or (y)
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Parent
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the " **Outstanding
Parent Voting Securities** "); provided, however, that for these purposes, an
acquisition by any person pursuant to a transaction which complies with
clauses (A), (B) and (C) of clause (3) below shall not constitute a Change in
Control;

 



 

(2) A majority of the members of the board of directors of Parent (the "
**Board** ") is replaced during any twelve (12)-month period by directors
whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members
constituting the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election;

 



 

(3) Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or an
acquisition of assets of another entity (a " **Business Combination** "), in
each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or
substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Parent Stock and Outstanding Parent
Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially
own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively,

 



     

 

 



 

the then outstanding shares of common stock or common equity interests and the
combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors or other governing body, as the
case may be, of the entity resulting from such Business Combination
(including, without limitation, an entity which as a result of such
transaction owns Parent or all or substantially all of Parents assets either
directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination
of the Outstanding Parent Stock and Outstanding Parent Voting Securities, as
the case may be, (B) no person beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50%
or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock or
common equity interests of the entity resulting from such Business Combination
or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such
entity except to the extent that such ownership results solely from ownership
of Parent that existed prior to the Business Combination and (C) at least a
majority of the members of the board of directors or similar governing body of
the entity resulting from such Business Combination, at the time of the
execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing
for such Business Combination, were members of the board of directors of
Parent as of the Effective Date, or became members of the board of directors
of Parent after the Effective Date and whose election or appointment or
nomination for election by Parents stockholders was approved by a vote of at
least a majority of the directors then comprising the board of directors of
Parent;

 



 

(4) Approval by the stockholders of Parent of a complete liquidation or
dissolution of Parent;

 



 

(5) Contractor is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary (or a wholly owned
subsidiary of one or more wholly owned subsidiaries) of Parent; and

 



 

(6) The consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Contractor to a
person that is not wholly owned subsidiary (or a wholly owned subsidiary of
one or more wholly owned subsidiaries) of Parent.

 



 

(c) Contractor may, by delivery of a written termination notice to Company,
terminate this Agreement with respect to a particular Fleet, if Company fails
to pay any undisputed invoice for Services properly performed by such Fleet or
other payment hereunder when such invoice or payment is due and payable
hereunder, unless within sixty (60) days following Companys receipt of a
written notice from Contractor to Company of such non-payment, Company makes
such payments in accordance herewith.

 



 

16. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and/or permitted assigns of each Party hereto. This Agreement shall not be assigned, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, operation of law, change in majority ownership of any entity directly or indirectly controlling Contractor or otherwise) in whole or in part, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that Company may assign and transfer this Agreement to any affiliate or subsidiary of Company without such consent. Without in any way limiting any of the foregoing provisions of this _Article 16_ , if Contractor assigns this Agreement, in whole or in part, the assignee (in the case of a direct assignment) and the ultimate parent of such assignee (in the case of a direct assignment) or the ultimate parent of Contractor (in the case of an indirect 

 



     

 

 



 

assignment after giving effect to such indirect assignment) shall be deemed
for all purposes to have agreed (in addition to Contractor) to perform and be
obligated for the obligations of Contractor under this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement by Contractor shall release Contractor from any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Any assignment or attempted
assignment of this Agreement that is not in accordance with this _Article 16_
shall be deemed null and void.

 



 

17. _Confidentiality_. Except as expressly authorized hereunder or by prior written agreement by an officer of Company, Contractor shall make no public announcement concerning this Agreement and all information contained herein or related to the Services is " **Company Confidential Information** " (as defined in the MSSA) and shall be held in strict confidence by Contractor. Contractor shall not disclose, publish, release, transfer or otherwise make available Company Confidential Information in any form to, or for the use or benefit of, any person or entity without Companys express written consent. Contractor shall disclose Company Confidential Information only to its personnel who have a need to know in performance of the Services, and Contractor shall ensure that Company Confidential Information is kept strictly confidential by such personnel in accordance with this _Article 17_.

 



 

18. _Health, Safety, Environment, Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Contractor shall be solely responsible for Contractor Groups (as defined
in the MSSA) safe behavior and work practices while on any Company location.
Contractor must immediately report all incidents (including safety hazards,
near misses, motor-vehicle accidents, injuries, illnesses, spills, and
property damage) that occur on a Company work site or location to the
appropriate on-site Company representative. Contractor shall intervene and, if
appropriate, stop work activity to ensure safety and operational integrity. If
Company performs a root cause analysis (" **RCA** ") or other investigation of
an incident, Contractor will fully cooperate with Company and promptly provide
all reasonable access, assistance, and materials that Company may request;
provided, that such provision would not materially violate Contractor
applicable policies. For any Contractor Group incident occurring on a Company
location, Contractor shall complete an incident report and conduct an incident
investigation (to include an RCA) and deliver the non-privileged portions of
these to a Company representative within one (1) week of the incident;
provided, that if the circumstances of the incident are such that completion
of Contractors incident investigation and RCA will, in good faith, require a
longer period, then Contractor will deliver an initial report of the incident
within one (1) week of the incident and the non-privileged portions of the
final investigation and RCA as promptly as possible. Contractors RCA shall
indicate how and why the incident occurred and identify actions that
Contractor will take or is taking to prevent a future occurrence of the
incident.

 



 

(b) After an incident, Company may place Contractor on a mutually agreed-upon
improvement plan, which may include any of the following:

 



 

(i) Health, safety and environmental training conducted by Company,
Contractor, or a third party;

 

(ii) temporary or permanent removal of any member of Contractor Group from
location;

 

(iii) reporting of improvement throughout the process; and

 

(iv) regular inspection of equipment or personnel.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) If any member of Contractor Group exhibits behavior that creates a safety
concern and does not reflect the corrective actions agreed-upon by Contractor
and Company, and that personnel does not rectify the behavior within thirty
(30) days, then Company may terminate this Agreement, without liability, other
than for amounts owed for Services performed up to the time of termination, as
of any date specified in a written notice to Contractor.

 



 

(d) With respect to the personnel performing the Services pursuant to this
Agreement, Contractor shall be solely responsible for compliance with all laws
applicable to Contractors employees, including without limitation all laws
and regulations regarding (i) the payment of wages and other compensation,
(ii) the payment of any taxes, licenses, fees and other assessments levied
upon the wages of the Contractor Group, as described in Section 9 of the MSSA,
including any such taxes or similar assessments payable by withholding, and
the payment of applicable employment taxes and other withholdings, and (iii)
all other employment obligations and liabilities.

 



 

(e) Without duplication of _Article 18(d)_ , Contractor shall pay or cause to
be paid all taxes, charges and assessments of every kind and character
required by statute or by order of any taxing authority with respect to the
provision of the Services. No Party shall be responsible nor liable for any
taxes or other charges levied or assessed against the facilities or property
of the other Party, including ad valorem taxes (however assessed), or against
the net worth or capital stock of such Party.

 



 

19. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when received if personally delivered; (ii) the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery to a domestic address by recognized overnight delivery service (e.g., DHL, UPS or Federal Express); (iii) upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) when verified by automated receipt or electronic logs if sent by email. In each case notice shall be sent as indicated below:

 **Target KPI = 25 plugs drilled in a 24-hour period per well (average)**

 



 

 **For illustrative purposes, performance over a period of time will be
tracked and compared against expected drill-out rate of 25 plugs per 24-hour
period**

 ** _EFFICIENCY RATE_**

 



 

 **The formula below shall be used to calculate Contractor s daily Efficiency
Rate. The Efficiency Rate for a well shall be calculated by averaging the
daily Efficiency Rates applicable to Contractors provision of the Services on
that well.**

 

 ** **

 

![](g422261ke23i002.jpg)

 

 ** _ _**

 

 ** _Example:_**

 

 **For one (1) day of Services, if the following non-productive time were
incurred:**

 

 ** **

 

 ***** **Company NPT: 1.95 hours; and**

 

 ***** **Contractor NPT: 0.75 hours;**

 



 

 **then that day s efficiency rate would be calculated as follows:**

 ** _EXHIBIT C TO PRESSURE PUMPING SERVICES AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 ** _EXAMPLE CALCULATION OF STAGE ATTAINMENT RATE_**

 



 

 ** _Calculation of Stage Attainment Rate:_**

 

 ** _ _**

 

1. Calculate target number of Stages to be attained for a day of Services by a Fleet:

 



 

![](g422261ke23i004.jpg)

 

 ** **

 

2. Compare the number of Stages actually attained by that Fleet to the target number of Stages to have been attained on that day.

 

 ** **

 

![](g422261ke23i005.jpg)

 

 ** **

 

3. Upon that Fleets completion of Services for the subject pad, average the daily Stage Attainment Rates applicable to such pad.

 

 ** **

 

For calculation, round up resulting decimals of 0.5 and greater, and round
down resulting decimals of less than 0.5.

 

 ** **

 

 *********

 



 

 ** _Example calculation of Stage Attainment Rate follows. The total number of
days to complete Services on this example pad is 10 days._**

 

 ** **

 

 **Example Day 1**

 

Company NPT = 1.5 hrs due to greasing valves

 

Pump Time = 90 mins per Stage

 

Switch-Over Time = 30 mins per Stage

 



 

![](g422261ke23i006.jpg)

 



 

Target Stage Attainment for the 24 hrs of Example Day 1 is 11 stages. During
this period, Contractor actually completed 11 Stages.

 



 

![](g422261ke23i007.jpg)

 



 

 **Example Day 2:** CompanyNPT = 3.75 hrs; Pump Time and Switch-Over time =
same as above, constant throughout.

 

Example Day 2 Target Stage Attainment = 10.125 Stages, rounded to 10 Stages.

 

Actual Stages Attained = 8 Stages.

 

Example Day 2 Stage Attainment Rate = 79.01235%, rounded to 79%.

 



 

 ** _*Calculations for remaining days on pad are performed in like manner, and
omitted from remainder of example*_**

 

 ** **

 

 **Example Day 3 Stage Attainment Rate:** 90%

 

 **Example Day 4 Stage Attainment Rate:** 96%

 

 **Example Day 5 Stage Attainment Rate:** 90%

 

 **Example Day 6 Stage Attainment Rate:** 100%

 

 **Example Day 7 Stage Attainment Rate:** 100%

 

 **Example Day 8 Stage Attainment Rate:** 95%

 

 **Example Day 9 Stage Attainment Rate:** 95%

 

 **Example Day 10 Stage Attainment Rate:** 100%

 

 ** **

 

 ** _Average of each Example Day s Stage Attainment Rate_** **:** 94.5%,
rounded to 95%

 



 

For this example pad, Contractors average Stage Attainment Rate of 95%
achieved the Per Pad Stage Attainment Rate.

otherwise expressly provided herein:

 



 

(i) The headings and captions of this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not define, limit or otherwise affect any of the
terms hereof.

have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the
plural, and vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires
otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and

this Agreement and if an ambiguity should arise, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or burdening any Party by virtue of the authorship
of any of the provisions in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2 _Board Designation Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Pioneer Designees_. Regardless of any advance notice provisions in the
Corporations organizational documents:

 



 

(i) From and after the Effective Date until the first date on which Pioneer
Beneficially Owns less than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock (the "
_Designation Rights Termination Date_ "), Pioneer shall have the right to
designate an individual to the Board (the " _Non-Independent Pioneer Designee_
"); and

 



 

(ii) From and after the Effective Date, Pioneer shall have the right to
designate an individual meeting the independence requirements of the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _Independent Pioneer
Designee_ "); _provided, however,_ that the right contained in this _Section
2(a)(ii)_ may only be exercised once and shall expire after the date of the
Corporations 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, Pioneer shall not be entitled to designate or
nominate any Person to stand for election to the Board pursuant to this
Agreement from and after the Designation Rights Termination Date.

 



 

(b) _Corporation Support_. Upon Pioneer providing notice in writing to the
Corporation as to the identity of the Pioneer Designees and reasonable
documentation as to the qualification of the Independent Pioneer Designee, the
Corporation shall take all reasonable necessary action within its power to
expand the Board and elect each Pioneer Designee to the Board as of the
Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter. Thereafter, with respect
to each Non-Independent Pioneer Designee, and solely until the completion of
the Corporations 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, with respect to the
Independent Pioneer Designee, the Corporation shall take all reasonable
necessary action within its power to (i) cause each Pioneer Designee to be
included in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board to the
Corporations stockholders for election as directors at each annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation (and/or in connection with any election by
written consent), (ii) include each Pioneer Designee in

 



     

 

 



 

the proxy statement and proxy, or information statement and consent,
distributed by the Corporation for the purpose of soliciting proxies or
consents for election to the Board and solicit proxies in favor of the
election of each Pioneer Designee, (iii) vote or provide a written consent or
proxy with respect to any Common Stock held by the Corporation in favor of the
election of each Pioneer Designee, and (iv) make, or cause to be made, with
governmental, administrative or regulatory authorities, all filings,
registrations or similar actions that are required to achieve such result. For
the avoidance of doubt, the requirements of the immediately preceding
sentence, as they apply to the Independent Pioneer Designee, shall only apply
with respect to the Corporations 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

 



 

(c) _Replacement of Directors_. Until the Designation Rights Termination Date,
in the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, disability,
retirement, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of the Non-
Independent Pioneer Designee, in his or her capacity as a director (the "
_Pioneer Director_ "), or in the event of the failure of the Non-Independent
Pioneer Designee to be elected, Pioneer shall have the right to designate
another individual to fill such vacancy. The Corporation shall take all
reasonable necessary action within its power to cause such vacancy to be
filled by the individual so designated in writing by Pioneer as soon as
practicable after such designation. Further, upon Pioneers written request,
the Corporation shall take all actions necessary to remove, with or without
cause, the Pioneer Director, and to elect any replacement director designated
in writing by Pioneer as provided in the first sentence of this _Section
2(c)_.

 



 

(d) _No Limitation_. The provisions of this _Section 2_ are intended to
provide Pioneer with the minimum Board representation rights set forth herein.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Corporation from having a greater
number of nominees or designees of Pioneer on the Board than otherwise
provided herein. In addition, nothing in this _Section 2_ shall be construed
to prevent Pioneer from having a lesser number of nominees or designees than
otherwise provided herein or pursuant to applicable law and the Corporations
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

(e) _Laws and Regulations_. Nothing in this _Section 2_ shall be deemed to
require that any Party, or any Affiliate thereof, act or be in violation of
any applicable provision of law, regulation, legal duty or requirement or
stock exchange or stock market rules or regulations.

 



 

Section 3 _Lock-Up_.

 



 

During the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending 180 days after
such date, Pioneer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, offer to sell, contract or
agree to offer or sell, solicit offers to purchase, hypothecate, pledge, grant
any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of,
directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or
liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_
"), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
promulgated thereunder, with respect to any shares of Common Stock

 



     

 

 



 

received by it on the Effective Date, (b) enter into any swap or other
arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any shares of Common Stock received by
it on the Effective Date, whether any such transaction is to be settled by
delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (c) publicly announce
any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b);
_provided, however,_ that this _Section 3_ shall not restrict Pioneers
transfer of any Common Stock to one or more of its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that such Affiliates agree to be bound by this _Section 3_.

 



 

Section 4 _Qualifications and Information_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Pioneer Designee shall be required to: (a) in the reasonable judgment of the
Board, have the requisite skill and experience to serve as a director of a
publicly traded company, and (b) not be prohibited or disqualified from
serving as a director of the Corporation pursuant to the applicable securities
laws, regulations or stock exchange or stock market rules or regulations. The
Board may adopt additional reasonable standards of skill and experience
desired of potential candidates for nomination to the Board or a committee of
the Board, which may be reflected in a charter of a committee of the Board or
other similar document. Pioneer shall use reasonable efforts to timely provide
the Corporation with accurate and complete information relating to any Pioneer
Designee that may be required to be disclosed by the Company under the
Exchange Act. In addition, at the Corporations request, Pioneer shall use
reasonable efforts to cause any Pioneer Designee to complete and execute a
Director and Officer Questionnaire, in the form required to be completed by
each of the Companys other directors, prior to being admitted to the Board or
any committee thereof or standing for reelection at an annual meeting of the
Corporations stockholders, or at such other time as may be requested by the
Corporation.

 



 

Section 5 _Duration of Agreement_.

 



 

This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the first to occur of the
following: (a) the dissolution of the Corporation (unless the Corporation
continues to exist after such dissolution as a limited liability company or in
another form, whether incorporated in Delaware or another jurisdiction); (b)
the Designation Rights Termination Date; and (c) upon written agreement by the
Parties.

 



 

Section 6 _Severability_.

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. In addition, any such invalid or
unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a provision that comes closest to
the business objective intended by such invalid or unenforceable provision
without being invalid or unenforceable itself.

 



 

Section 7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to its choice or conflict of
law provisions or rules.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the
United States federal and state courts located in the State of Texas with
respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in relation to
or in connection with this Agreement, and each of the Parties agrees that any
action with respect to any such dispute, controversy, or claim will be
determined exclusively in a state or federal district court located in Dallas
County, Texas. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT
OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE.

stock dividend, split, reverse split, combination, recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise in such a manner and with

provisions hereof and so that the rights, privileges, duties and obligations
hereunder shall continue with respect to the Stock as so changed.

 **ARTICLE II 
REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Shelf Registration_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following its
receipt of a written request from any Holder to register its Registrable
Securities, the Company shall notify all Holders that a Shelf Registration
Statement will be filed with the Commission within sixty (60) days from the
date such request is made, and the Company shall prepare and file a Shelf
Registration Statement, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become effective as soon
as permitted pursuant to applicable securities law. A Shelf Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be on such
appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by the
Company in its sole discretion. The Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement filed and
declared effective pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ to be continuously
effective under the Securities Act until all Registrable Securities covered by
the Shelf Registration Statement have either been distributed in the manner
set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration Statement or ceased to
be Registrable Securities (the " ** _Effectiveness Period_** "). The Shelf
Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Shelf Registration Statement, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made).

 



 

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable
Securities are

 



     

 

 



 

included in the Shelf Registration Statement, suspend such Selling Holders
use of any prospectus which is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement (in
which event the Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement) if (i) there is or is
reasonably anticipated to be an acquisition, merger, financing activity,
reorganization, disposition or other transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries and the Company determines in good faith that the ability
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pursue or consummate such a
transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure
of such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement, (ii) the Company has
experienced, or reasonably expects to experience, some other material non-
public event the disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment
of the Company, would materially adversely affect the Company or its business
prospects, (iii) for reasons beyond the Companys control, any required
financial statements are unavailable, or (iv) the Company is required under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to file with the Commission any report
or other document necessitating a post-effective amendment to the Shelf
Registration Statement; _provided, however_ , in no event shall any delay
pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) immediately above exceed sixty (60) days
in any one hundred eighty (180) day period or ninety (90) days in any twelve-
month period, in each case, exclusive of days covered by any lock-up agreement
executed by a Selling Holder in connection with any Underwritten Offering.
Upon the disclosure of such information, the termination of the condition
described above or the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment, the
Company shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, shall promptly
terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such
other actions reasonably necessary to permit registered sales of Registrable
Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If the Company at any time proposes to (i) register any
Common Stock for its own account for sale to the public in an Underwritten
Offering or (ii) otherwise file any registration statement with the Commission
relating to any Underwritten Offering of Common Stock (other than (i) pursuant
to a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) relating
solely to an offering or sale to employees or directors of the Company
pursuant to any employee benefit plans or arrangements, (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement on Form S-4 (or any successor form) relating to a
transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities Act or any successor rule
thereto), or (iii) in connection with any dividend or distribution
reinvestment or similar plan), and the form of Registration Statement to be
used may be used for any registration of Registrable Securities, then, as soon
as practicable following the engagement of counsel to the Company to prepare
the documents to be used in connection with an Underwritten Offering, the
Company shall give notice of such proposed Underwritten Offering to the
Holders, and such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in
such Underwritten Offering such number of shares of Common Stock constituting
Registrable Securities (the " ** _Included Registrable Securities_** ") as
each such Holder may request in writing (a " ** _Piggyback Registration_** "),
subject to the cutback provisions of _Section 2.2(b)_. The notice required to
be provided in this _Section 2.2(a)_ to each of the Holders shall be provided
on a Business Day pursuant to _Section 3.1_ hereof and receipt of such notice
shall be confirmed by the Holder. Each such Holder shall have three (3)
Business Days (or two (2) Business Days in connection with any overnight or
bought Underwritten Offering) from the date of such notice to

 



     

 

 



 

request in writing the inclusion of a specified number of shares of Common
Stock constituting Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering. If no
written request or an incomplete request for inclusion from a Holder is
received by the Company within such specified time, each such Holder shall
have no further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. The
Company may postpone or withdraw the filing or the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time
in its sole discretion. If, at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering and prior to the closing of
such Underwritten Offering, the Company shall determine for any reason not to
undertake or to delay such Underwritten Offering, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to the Selling Holders
and, (1) in the case of a determination not to undertake such Underwritten
Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable
Securities in connection with such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (2)
in the case of a determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be
permitted to delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same
period as the delay in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall
have the right to withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such
Selling Holders Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by
giving written notice to the Company of such withdrawal prior to the time of
pricing of such Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section
2.2_ advises the Company that the total number of shares of Common Stock that
the Selling Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering
exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock that can be sold in such offering
without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the shares of Common Stock offered or the market for the
Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be included in such
Underwritten Offering shall include the number of shares of Common Stock
constituting Registrable Securities that such Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters advises the Company can be sold without having such adverse
effect, with such number to be allocated:

 



 

(i) _first_ , to the Company, up to the number of shares of Common Stock
sought to be sold by the Company in such Underwritten Offering; and

 



 

(ii) _second_ , _pro rata_ among the Selling Holders who have requested
participation in such Underwritten Offering and any other holder of shares of
Common Stock having rights of registration that are not expressly subordinated
to the Registrable Securities (the " ** _Parity Securities_** "). The pro rata
allocations for each such Selling Holder who has requested participation in
such Underwritten Offering shall be the product of (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
in such Underwritten Offering multiplied by (B) the fraction derived by
dividing (1) the number of shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable
Securities owned by such Selling Holder at the time of its request for
inclusion in such Underwritten Offering by (2) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities owned by all Selling
Holders at such time plus the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
constituting the Parity Securities owned by all holders of the Parity
Securities, in each case, that are participating in such Underwritten
Offering.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under
this _Section 2.2_, the Company shall be entitled to select the Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in its sole discretion. In connection with an
Underwritten Offering under this _Section 2.2_ in which a Selling Holder
participates, each such Selling Holder and the Company shall enter into an
underwriting agreement with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters and such
underwriting agreement shall contain such representations, covenants,
indemnities and other rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting
agreements for firm commitment offerings of equity securities. No Selling
Holder may participate in an Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder
agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such
underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers
of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting agreement. No Selling Holder shall be required to
make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements
regarding such Selling Holder, its authority to enter into such underwriting
agreement and to offer and sell any Registrable Securities that it owns
(including that such actions will not conflict with, breach, violate or result
in a default under such Selling Holders organizational documents, material
agreements or any applicable law, as applicable, nor result in the creation or
imposition of any liens on property of such Selling Holder), and its ownership
of such Registrable Securities being registered on its behalf and its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten Offering, such
Selling Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to the Company and
the Managing Underwriter; _provided, however_ , that such withdrawal must be
made at least one (1) Business Day prior to the time of pricing of such
Underwritten Offering to be effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall
affect the Companys obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Demand Offering_.

 



 

(a) _Demand Offering Rights_. Subject to the conditions of this _Section
2.3_, any Holder (in such capacity, the " ** _Initiating Holder_** ") may
request in writing (a " ** _Demand Request_** ") that the Company undertake an
Underwritten Offering (a " ** _Demand Offering_** "); _provided, however,_
that a Demand Offering may only be made if (i) the Registrable Securities
requested to be registered by the Initiating Holder delivering the Demand
Request have a Market Value of at least $30,000,000 on the trading day
immediately preceding the date that the Demand Request is sent to the Company
and (ii) it shall not cause the Holders to request more than two (2) Demand
Offerings in any consecutive 12-month period. Following receipt of a Demand
Request, the Company shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give
written notice of such request to all other Holders in accordance with
_Section 3.1_ of this Agreement. Such other Holders shall then have up to ten
(10) Business Days from the mailing of such notice by the Company to request
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Demand Offering, and, upon receipt
of the request from such other Holders, the Company shall, subject to the
limitations of _Section 2.3(a)(i)_, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to undertake and effect such Demand Offering as soon as practicable following
the receipt of the notice from all such other Holders (" ** _Accepting
Holders_** " and, together with the Initiating Holder, the " ** _Requesting
Holders_** ").

 



 

(i) _Underwritten Offerings_. The underwriter for a Demand Offering will be
selected by the Initiating Holder and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The

 



     

 

 



 

right of any Holder to include his, her or its Registrable Securities in such
Demand Offering shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
Demand Offering and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in
the Demand Offering to the extent provided herein. The Company shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for such Demand Offering. No Accepting Holder may
participate in such Demand Offering unless such Accepting Holder agrees to
sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting agreement. If any Accepting Holder disapproves of the terms of an
underwriting, such Accepting Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice
to the Company, the Initiating Holder and the Managing Underwriter; _provided,
however_ , that such withdrawal must be made at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the time of pricing of such Demand Offering to be effective.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Demand Offering_. If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
of any proposed Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ advises
the Company and the Initiating Holder that the total number of shares of
Common Stock that the Requesting Holders intend to include in such offering
exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock that can be sold in such offering
without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of shares of Common Stock offered or the market for the Common
Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be included in such offering shall
include the number of shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable
Securities that such Managing Underwriter or Underwriters advises the Company
and the Initiating Holder can be sold without having such adverse effect, with
such number to be allocated:

 



 

(i) _first_ , _pro rata_ among the Requesting Holders (based, for each such
Requesting Holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
by such Requesting Holder in such offering by (B) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
by all such Requesting Holders in the Demand Offering); and

 



 

(ii) _second_ , _pro rata_ among the holders of any Parity Securities (based,
for each such holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock constituting Parity Securities proposed to be sold by
such holder in such offering by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock constituting Parity Securities proposed to be sold by all such holders
in the Demand Offering); and

 



 

(iii) _third,_ any shares of Common Stock to be sold for the account of the
Company.

 



 

(c) _Number of Demand Offerings_. No more three (3) Demand Offerings may be
made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(d) _Demand Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company may, upon written notice to the Requesting Holders, delay
a Demand Offering if (i) there is or is reasonably anticipated to be an
acquisition, merger, financing activity, reorganization, disposition or other
transaction involving the Company or any

 



     

 

 



 

of its subsidiaries and the Company determines in good faith that the ability
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pursue or consummate such a
transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure
of such transaction in the registration statement for the Demand Offering,
(ii) the Company has experienced some other material non-public event the
disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company,
would materially adversely affect the Company or its business prospects, or
(iii) for reasons beyond the Companys control, any required financial
statements are unavailable; _provided, however_ , in no event shall any delay
pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) immediately above exceed ninety (90)
days or be utilized more than once in any twelve-month period, exclusive of
days covered by any lock-up agreement executed by a Selling Holder in
connection with any Underwritten Offering. Upon the disclosure of such
information or the termination of the condition described above, the Company
shall provide prompt notice to the Requesting Holders, shall promptly
recommence the delayed Demand Offering and shall take such other actions
reasonably necessary to permit registered sales of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Demand Offering.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations contained
in _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3_, the Company will, as
expeditiously as reasonably practicable:

 



 

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by _Section 2.3_ of this Agreement and
the prospectus included therein or any supplement or amendment thereto, upon
request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed
to be filed (including exhibits and each document incorporated by reference
therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of the
Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to
any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution
that is contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by
such Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing the Shelf
Registration Statement or such other registration statement and the prospectus
included therein or any supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such number
of copies of the Shelf Registration Statement or such other registration
statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements and
amendments thereto as such Selling Holder may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement or such other registration
statement;

 



 

(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement
or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request as may be necessary for the marketability of the
Registrable Securities; _provided_ , however, that the Company will not be
required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then required to so qualify or to

 



     

 

 



 

take any action that would subject it to general service of process or
taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

 



 

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement or any
other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus
included therein or any amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to
such Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any
post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective and (ii)
any written comments from the Commission with respect to any filing referred
to in clause (i) and any written request by the Commission for amendments or
supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus included therein or
any amendment or supplement thereto;

 



 

(e) as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, notify each
Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to
be delivered by any of them under the Securities Act, of (i) the happening of
any event as a result of which the prospectus contained in the Shelf
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing, (ii) the issuance or express threat of issuance
by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, or
(iii) the receipt by the Company of any written notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale
under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, the Company agrees to as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement the prospectus (or prepare and file
appropriate reports under the Exchange Act) or take other appropriate action
so that the prospectus does not include an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
then existing and to take such other commercially reasonable action as is
necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings
related thereto; _provided, however,_ that during the period in which the use
of such prospectus may be suspended under this Agreement, no supplement or
amendment need be furnished until the termination of such suspension;

 



 

(f) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(g) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months,
beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date

 



     

 

 



 

of such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated
thereunder;

 



 

(h) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and the Company
personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a
due diligence defense under the Securities Act; _provided_ that the Company
need not disclose any information to any such representative unless and until
such representative has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company;

 



 

(i) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which securities of the same class or series issued by the
Company are then listed;

 



 

(j) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 



 

(k) provide a transfer agent and registrar, which may be a single entity, for
all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later
than the effective date of such registration statement; and

 



 

(l) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening
of any event of the kind described in subsection _(e)_ of this _Section 2.4_
or the commencement of any delay period contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_ or
_Section 2.3(d)_, shall forthwith discontinue and suspend offers and sales of
the Registrable Securities until such Selling Holders receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subsection _(e)_ of
this _Section 2.4_ or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the
prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, such Selling Holder will, or
will request the Managing Underwriter or underwriters, if any, to deliver to
the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies (including, without
limitation, any and all drafts) in their possession or control, other than
permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the
prospectus and any prospectus supplement covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no obligation to
include in any Registration Statement Registrable Securities of a Holder, in a
Piggyback Registration Registrable Securities of a Selling Holder, or in a
Demand Offering Registrable Securities of an Accepting Holder who has failed
to timely furnish such information that the Company determines, after
consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for the
registration statement or prospectus, as applicable, to comply with the
Securities Act.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 2.6. _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities that participates in an
Underwritten Offering agrees not to effect any sale or distribution of the
Registrable Securities during the 30 calendar day period beginning on the date
of a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with respect to the
pricing of such Underwritten Offering, or other prospectus (including any free
writing prospectus) containing the terms of the pricing of such Underwritten
Offering other than sales or distributions pursuant to such Underwritten
Offering; _provided_ that the duration of the foregoing restriction shall be
shortened or extended, as applicable, to match the duration of the shortest
restriction imposed by the underwriters on the officers or directors or any
other shareholder of the Company on whom a restriction is imposed in
connection with such Underwritten Offering.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " ** _Registration Expenses_** " means all expenses
incident to the Companys performance under or compliance with this Agreement
to effect the registration of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, a Piggyback Registration pursuant to _Section
2.2_, a Demand Offering pursuant to _Section 2.3,_ and the disposition of
such securities, including, without limitation, all registration, filing,
securities exchange listing fees, all registration, filing, qualification and
other fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, fees of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., transfer taxes and fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, and the fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public
accountants for the Company, including the expenses of any special audits or
"cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and
compliance. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.7_ hereof, the
Company shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by Holders in
connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder. In addition,
the Company shall not be responsible for any " ** _Selling Expenses_** ,"
which means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions, or
similar fees or arrangements allocable to the sale of the Registrable
Securities, and transfer taxes allocable to the sale of the Registrable
Securities.

 



 

(b) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses in
connection with a Piggyback Registration or Underwritten Offering (including
any Demand Offering), regardless of whether any sale is made pursuant to the
Piggyback Registration or Underwritten Offering (including any Demand
Offering). Each Selling Holder shall pay all Selling Expenses allocated (on a
_pro rata_ basis) to such Selling Holder in connection with any sale of its
Registrable Securities hereunder.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By the Company_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder and its
directors and officers, , and each underwriter, pursuant to the applicable
underwriting agreement with such underwriter, of Registrable Securities
thereunder and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder or
underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against
any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses)

 



     

 

 



 

(collectively, " ** _Losses_** "), joint or several, to which such Selling
Holder or any such director, officer, underwriter or controlling Person may
become subject under the Securities Act, or otherwise, insofar as such Losses
(or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement
or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any free
writing prospectus related thereto, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such
Selling Holder, its directors and officers, each such underwriter and each
such controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply, and the
Company will not be liable, in any such case (i) if and to the extent that any
such Loss (or action or proceeding, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from such Shelf
Registration Statement or other registration statement, preliminary prospectus
or final prospectus contained therein, or any free writing prospectus related
thereto, or amendment or supplement thereof in reliance upon and made in
conformity with information furnished by or on behalf of such Selling Holder,
such underwriter or such controlling Person in writing specifically for use or
inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, as applicable, or (ii) if and to the extent
that such Loss results from any of the Selling Holders failing to comply with
the terms of the plan of distribution mechanics described in the applicable
prospectus. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder or any such
director, officer, underwriter or controlling Person, and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder.

 



 

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. As a condition to including any Registrable
Securities to be offered by a Selling Holder in the Shelf Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement,
each Selling Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to be bound by the
terms of this _Section 2.8(b)_ and to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors, officers, legal counsel and accountants, each Person,
if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, any underwriter, and any controlling Person within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act of any such underwriter, against any
Losses, joint or several, to which the Company or any such director, officer,
underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities Act
or otherwise, (i) if and to the extent that any such Loss (or action or
proceeding, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or
omission or alleged omission from such Shelf Registration Statement or other
registration statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, or amendment or
supplement thereof, if such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement,
omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and made in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder expressly for use or inclusion in the Shelf Registration

 



      

 

 



 

Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendment
or supplement thereof, as applicable, or (ii) if and to the extent that such
Loss results from the Selling Holders failing to comply with the terms of the
plan of distribution mechanics described in the applicable prospectus. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, or any such director,
officer, legal counsel, accountants, underwriter or controlling Person and
shall survive the transfer of such shares by the Selling Holders, and such
Selling Holder shall reimburse the Company, and each such director, officer,
legal counsel, accountants, underwriter or controlling Person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Loss or actions or proceedings; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
liability of each Selling Holder under this _Section 2.8(b)_ shall not be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the gross proceeds received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification.

 



 

(c) _Third Party Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving
a claim referred to in _Section 2.8(a)_ or _Section 2.8(b)_ (including any
action brought by a governmental entity), such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party under this _Section 2.8_, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by
such omission to give notice. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party
and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this _Section 2.8_
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; _provided, however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has
failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (ii) if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and counsel to the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that
there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or
if counsel to the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses
related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred. Neither an indemnified party nor an indemnifying party shall be
liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its
consent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
indemnifying party shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent
of the indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability
or obligation on, includes a complete release from liability of, and does not
contain any admission of wrong doing by, the indemnified party. In the event
that an indemnifying party does or is not permitted to assume the defense of
an action pursuant to this _Section 2.8(c)_ or in the case of the expense
reimbursement obligation set forth in _Section 2.8(a)_

 



     

 

 



 

or _Section 2.8(b)_, the indemnification required by _Section 2.8(a)_ or
_Section 2.8(b)_ shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when invoices or
bills are received or Losses incurred.

 



 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.8_
is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to the Company or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold
them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall (i) contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault
of the Company on the one hand and of such Selling Holder on the other
(determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission which
resulted in such Losses relates to information supplied by the Company or the
Selling Holder and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party
than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate relative
fault of the Company and such Selling Holder, but also the relative benefits
received by each, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations;
_provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, in no event shall such Selling Holder be required to
contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of gross
proceeds received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and each Selling Holder on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by
such party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant
to this paragraph were to be determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Company agrees, at all times at which the Company has securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to:

 



 

(a) Make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

 



     

 

 



 

(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act; and

 



 

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (unless
otherwise available at no charge by access electronically to the Commissions
EDGAR filing system) to such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and
documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of
any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such
securities without registration.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Company to register Registrable Securities granted to the Holders by
the Company under this _Article II_ may be transferred or assigned by each
such Holder to one or more transferees or assignees of such Registrable
Securities (each, a " ** _Transferee_** "), who (a) are Affiliates of such
Holder, or (b) hold, collectively with its or their Affiliates, after giving
effect to such transfer or assignment, at least 50% of the Registrable
Securities of all Holders as of such date. The Company shall be given written
notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address
of each such Transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which
such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and each such
Transferee shall assume in writing responsibility for its obligations of such
Holder under this Agreement by executing a joinder agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. Subject to
_Section 2.10_, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding Registrable Securities, enter into any agreement with any current
or future holder of any securities of the Company that would allow such
current or future holder to require the Company to include securities in any
registration statement filed by the Company on a basis other than pari passu
with, or expressly subordinate to, the rights granted to the Holders
hereunder.

 



 

Section 2.12. _Aggregation of Registrable Securities_. All Registrable
Securities held or acquired by Persons who are Affiliates of one another shall
be aggregated together for the purpose of determining the availability of any
rights under this Agreement.

date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of this

limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to an
injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it
may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to
grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this
right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any other rights and
remedies at law or in equity which such Person may have.

 



 

Section 3.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an

unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions,
