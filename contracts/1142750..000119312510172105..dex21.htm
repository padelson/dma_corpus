shares of AMN Preferred Stock or AMN Common Stock in book-entry form) to backup withholding at the then-applicable rate (which as of the date hereof is 28%) on any payments made in respect of surrendered Certificates. The phrase &#147;Applied

<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">United States federal tax law generally requires that a stockholder that is a U.S. person within the meaning of the United States
Internal Revenue Code (including, among others, a U.S. resident alien) surrendering Certificates provide the Company and any other payor of Merger Consideration with such stockholder&#146;s correct TIN on Substitute Form W-9, which, in the case of a
surrendering stockholder who is an individual, is his or her social security number. If a stockholder does not provide the correct TIN or if any other information is not correctly provided, such stockholder may be subject to a penalty of up to $500
imposed by the IRS. In addition, such stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at the then-applicable rate (which as of the date hereof is 28%) on any payments received in respect of surrendered Certificates. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Certain persons are not subject to backup withholding. An exempt stockholder, other than a non-U.S. person, should enter the
stockholder&#146;s name, address, status and TIN on the face of the Substitute Form W-9, check the &#147;Exempt&#148; box in Part II of the Substitute Form W-9, and sign, date and return the Substitute Form W-9. See the enclosed Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 (the &#147;<U>W-9 Guidelines</U>&#148;) for additional instructions. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A surrendering stockholder that is not a U.S. person within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code (a &#147;<U>non-U.S.
stockholder</U>&#148;) should not complete the Substitute Form W-9. A non-U.S. stockholder instead should obtain the applicable IRS Form W-8 from the Exchange Agent or from the IRS website at www.irs.gov. The non-U.S. stockholder should then
complete, sign and return the appropriate IRS Form W-8 in accordance with the instructions to such form in order to avoid any applicable withholding taxes. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their tax advisors regarding any questions they may
have with respect to the completion of the appropriate IRS Form W-8. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If backup withholding applies, AMN or such other payor,
as applicable, generally is required to withhold at the then-applicable rate on any consideration to be received by a payee. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the United States federal income tax liability of persons subject to
backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of such withholding provided the required information is furnished to the IRS. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS, provided that the
required information is furnished to the IRS. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To prevent backup withholding, each surrendering stockholder (other than an
exempt or non-U.S. stockholder subject to the requirements set forth above) should provide such stockholder&#146;s correct TIN by completing the &#147;Substitute Form W-9&#148; set forth below, certifying that (i)&nbsp;the TIN provided is correct
(or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN) and (ii)&nbsp;the stockholder is not subject to backup withholding because (a)&nbsp;the stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, (b)&nbsp;the stockholder has not been notified by the IRS that such
stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends or (c)&nbsp;the IRS has notified the stockholder that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding and (iii)&nbsp;the
stockholder is a U.S. person. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The surrendering stockholder (other than an exempt or non-U.S. stockholder subject to the
requirements set forth above) is required to give the TIN (e.g., the social security number or employer identification number) of the record holder of the Certificates. If the Certificates are in more than one name or are not in the name of the
actual owner, consult the W-9 Guidelines for information on which TIN to report. If the stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, the stockholder may return a properly
completed, signed Substitute Form W-9 with &#147;Applied for&#148; written in Part I. If &#147;Applied for&#148; is written in Part I, the stockholder must also complete the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number in order to avoid
backup withholding. If &#147;Applied for&#148; is written in Part I, (i)&nbsp;AMN or other payor may subject the consideration payable in respect of surrendered Certificates to backup withholding and (ii)&nbsp;if a TIN is not provided within sixty
(60)&nbsp;days, backup withholding may begin with respect to the consideration payable and continue until the stockholder furnishes its TIN. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">SAN DIEGO, July&nbsp;28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ &#151; AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation&#146;s largest healthcare staffing and
workforce solutions company, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the parent company of Arlington, Texas-based Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), one of the nation&#146;s leading providers of clinical workforce managed services programs.
Through its multi-brand strategy, Medfinders also provides travel nurse and allied staffing, locum tenens, physician search services, and home healthcare services, as well as local nurse and allied staffing in support of its managed services
programs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Bringing together the experience and diverse capabilities of both companies in healthcare staffing and managed services will
create significant short and long-term benefits for our clients,&#148; said Susan Nowakowski, President and CEO of AMN Healthcare. &#147;The expansion of our service lines resulting from this combination will substantially improve our ability to
deliver an innovative, total workforce management and staffing solution to our broad and growing client base. This is a strategic opportunity for two leaders in healthcare staffing to come together to achieve additional sales and operating
efficiencies while immediately enhancing and expanding our service offerings.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;This is an ideal combination for our clients,
healthcare professionals, and team members,&#148; said Bob Livonius, CEO of Medfinders. &#147;As an integrated and increasingly diverse company, we will be even more effective and efficient in delivering high quality and innovative workforce
management solutions to our clients across the full spectrum of clinical specialties and services.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under the terms of the agreement,
AMN will acquire all of the outstanding equity of Medfinders&#146; parent company for approximately 6.3&nbsp;million shares of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. common stock, and approximately 5.7&nbsp;million shares of AMN Series A Conditional
Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and a dividend rate of 11%&nbsp;per annum. Initially, the preferred stock will be non-voting and will not be convertible into shares of AMN common stock. Following the
closing of the transaction, AMN shareholders will be asked to approve at a shareholders&#146; meeting the voting rights of the preferred stock and the convertibility on a one-for-one basis. AMN expects to file a proxy statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission following the closing. If AMN&#146;s shareholders approve the conversion and the voting features of the preferred stock within 180 days of the closing of the transaction, the preferred stock shall cease to accrue dividends
and any accrued dividends will be forgiven. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with the transaction, AMN Healthcare is expected to refinance its existing Term B
facility of approximately $107 million and pay off Medfinders&#146; existing debt facilities totaling approximately $132 million. AMN Healthcare expects to amend and extend its current Term B loan and increase its balance by an estimated $68 million
to $175 million and issue a second lien term loan of $50 million. In addition, AMN Healthcare expects to amend and extend its existing revolving credit facility, which is expected to be undrawn at closing. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Valuing all of the equity securities to be issued in the transaction using AMN Healthcare&#146;s closing share price on the day immediately preceding the
execution of the definitive agreement, and assuming conversion of the preferred securities to be issued by AMN Healthcare, the transaction has a value of approximately $220 million (including approximately $132 million of Medfinders&#146;
indebtedness to be refinanced). Upon consummation of the transaction, former Medfinders&#146; shareholders will own approximately 26% of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis). The transaction, which is expected to
be accretive to full year earnings in 2011, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010, and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and receipt of debt financing. </FONT></P>
