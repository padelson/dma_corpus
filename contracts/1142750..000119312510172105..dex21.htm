paid and non-assessable shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the aggregate Series C Liquidation Value
(as defined in the Certificate of Designations of the Company Series C

Series C Preferred Stock, _by_ (B) $10 (as adjusted in accordance with

Preferred Warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

the consent of the holders thereof, into the right to receive, and (b) with
respect to the Preferred Options and Preferred Warrants, whether or not then
exercisable, sold by means of surrender and cancellation in exchange for,
collectively, an aggregate number of shares of Buyer Stock equal to the
Aggregate Exchange Buyer Stock, which shall be allocated among the holders of
shares of Company Preferred Stock and the holders of the Preferred Options
and Preferred Warrants in accordance with their respective Consideration
Percentages; _provided_ , _however_ , that such consideration payable under
this Section 3.1(c)(ii) shall be adjusted pursuant to Sections 3.4(d) and
3.6;

(d) immediately after the Effective Time, all Capital Stock of the Company,
including any Preferred Options, Preferred Warrants, Options and Warrants
relating thereto, shall no longer be outstanding and, to the extent
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired, or converted in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(c)(ii) among the Stockholders
(including holders of Preferred Options and Preferred Warrants) based on their
respective Consideration Percentages, and the Company Series C Preferred
Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred Options and Preferred Warrants
they will own at the Closing.

3.2 _Calculation of Consideration_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Statement and Transaction Expenses_. Not fewer than three
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (i) the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good
faith estimates of (A) Closing Indebtedness, (B) Transaction Expenses, (C)
Net Working Capital and (D) the Adjustment Amount, in each case, determined in
accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, together with supporting
documentation for such estimates and any additional information reasonably
requested by the Buyer, and (ii) the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer
final invoices with respect to all Transaction Expenses to be paid by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Closing (the " _Closing Transaction
Expenses_ "). The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in consultation with
the Buyer and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer.

 



 

15 (b) _Defined Terms for purposes of Calculation of Consideration_. 

(i) " _Aggregate Exchange Buyer Common Stock_ " means 6,300,000 shares of
Buyer Common Stock. 

(ii) " _Aggregate Exchange Buyer Series A Preferred Stock_" means a number of
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (i) (A) $198,710,000, _minus_ (B)
$19,000,000 (the " _Buyer Holdback Amount_ "), _plus_  (C) the estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment (if the estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment is
a positive number), _minus_ (D) the absolute value of the estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment (if the estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
is a negative number), _minus_ (E) the estimated Closing Indebtedness, _minus_
(F) the estimated Transaction Expenses _by_ (ii) $11. The Aggregate Exchange
Buyer Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment following the
closing pursuant to Section 3.4.

(iii) " _Aggregate Exchange Buyer Stock_ " means (i) a number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the Aggregate Exchange Buyer Common Stock, _plus_
(ii) a number of shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock equal to the
Aggregate Exchange Buyer Series A Preferred Stock less the Company Series C
Preferred Stock Consideration.

(c)  _Adjustments_. The calculation of the consideration payable and the
valuation of each share of Buyer Stock, for all purposes of this Agreement,
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock or any Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar
change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing.

 

(d) _Withholding_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
hereunder to any Person such consideration as it is required to deduct and
withhold under any provision of any Tax Law. To the extent that any
consideration is so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld
consideration shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

3.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall appoint American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company as an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging certificates of the Company Series C Preferred Stock
and the Company Preferred Stock and copies of executed Surrender Agreements as
evidence of Preferred Options and Preferred Warrants (each, a " _Certificate_
") for the Buyer Stock, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer will cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to the extent not already sent by the Company in
accordance with Section 6.26, to each holder of record of shares of Company
Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred Options and
Preferred Warrants as of the Effective Time, whose shares of Company Series C
Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred Options and Preferred
Warrants were converted or exchanged, as applicable, into the right to receive
shares of Buyer Stock pursuant to Section 3.1, a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent),
including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificates to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Buyer Stock (which
letter of transmittal shall be accompanied by all financial information with
respect to Buyer as required to be furnished to the Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 502(b)(2)(ii) if so requested by Buyer). Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Buyer shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent the number
of shares of Buyer Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form)
payable as consideration upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to
the provisions of this Article III. All book-entry shares representing Buyer
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to



 

16  irrevocable instructions, deliver the Buyer Stock contemplated to be
delivered to the Stockholders out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Preferred Options and Preferred Warrants that have been
converted or exchanged, as applicable, into the right to receive shares of
Buyer Stock, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Buyer or the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor shares of Buyer Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the number of
shares of Buyer Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article III (less any required Tax withholding). The
Buyer Stock shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificates and letter of transmittal in accordance
with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any consideration
payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive such Buyer Stock as contemplated by Section 3.1.

 

(c) If any portion of the Buyer Stock payable under this Article III is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery of the Buyer Stock shall pay to the Exchange Agent any required
transfer or other similar Taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Preferred Options or Preferred Warrants. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Series C
Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred Options or Preferred
Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Series C Preferred
Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred Options or Preferred
Warrants except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent
or the Buyer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Article III.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred
Options or Preferred Warrants six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to the Buyer, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
his or her shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Preferred Options or Preferred Warrants for the Buyer Stock in
accordance with this Section 3.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Buyer for delivery of the Buyer Stock in respect of such holders
shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred
Options or Preferred Warrants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Buyer, the Surviving Company nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Preferred
Options or Preferred Warrants for any consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Buyer
Stock payable in accordance with this Agreement remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Preferred Options or Preferred Warrants immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

3.4 _Series A Preferred Stock Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) _Closing Statement_. Within 90 days following the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a certificate executed
by an executive officer of the Buyer (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth the Buyers determination of (i) Closing Indebtedness, (ii) Transaction
Expenses,



 

17  (iii) Net Working Capital and (iv) the Adjustment Amount, in each case
determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. Following delivery of
the Closing Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Representative with any
supporting documentation for the Closing Statement that the Representative may
reasonably request.

 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. Within 30 days after the Representatives receipt
of the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a
written statement either accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any
objections thereto in reasonable detail (an " _Objections Statement_ "), which
objections shall be limited to mathematical errors and/or computations of the
amounts specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Section 3.4(a) not
having been made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If
the Representative does not deliver an Objections Statement within such
30-day period, then the Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon
all parties. If the Representative does deliver an Objections Statement within
such 30-day period, then the Representative and the Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith for 15 days following the Buyers receipt of such Objections
Statement to resolve such objections (any unresolved objection, a " _Dispute_
"). After such 15-day period, any item or matter set forth in the Closing
Statement that is not a Dispute shall become final and binding upon all
parties. If the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve all
objections during such 15-day period, then any remaining Disputes, and only
such remaining Disputes, shall be resolved by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or,
if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not available for such assignment, such other
nationally recognized accounting firm upon which the Buyer and
the Representative shall reasonably agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining Disputes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30 days after its
appointment. The resolution of such Disputes by the Accounting Firm (i) shall
be set forth in writing, (ii) shall be within the range of dispute between the
Buyer and the Representative, (iii) shall constitute an arbitral award, and
(iv) shall be conclusive and binding upon all the parties upon which a
judgment may be rendered by a court having proper jurisdiction thereover. Upon
delivery of such resolution, the Closing Statement, as modified in accordance
with such resolution, shall become final and binding upon all parties.

(c) _Fees and Expenses of Accounting Firm_. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by either the Buyer or the Stockholders
as follows: (i) if the Accounting Firm determines that the Adjustment Amount
is more than five percent (5%) greater or lower than the Adjustment Amount
determined by the Buyer, then the Buyer shall bear the fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm, and (ii) if the Accounting Firm determines
that the Adjustment Amount is less than five percent (5%) greater or lower
than the Adjustment Amount determined by the Buyer, then the Stockholders
shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm through the
payment of such fees, costs and expenses by the Buyer and a deduction of the
amount thereof from the Buyer Holdback Amount in the form of shares of Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock (based on a value of $11 per share). In such event
the Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
the proper amount of shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock from the Buyer
Holdback Amount to the Buyer.

 

(d) _Final Adjustment Amount_. As used herein, " _Final Adjustment Amount_
" means (i) if the Representative fails to deliver an Objections Statement in
accordance with Section 3.4(b), the Adjustment Amount as set forth in the
Closing Statement, or (ii) if the Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Closing Statement is resolved by resolution of the Buyer and the
Representative or by submission of any remaining Disputes to the Accounting
Firm, as contemplated by Section 3.4(b), the Adjustment Amount as so resolved.
If the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the estimated Adjustment
Amount set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement, then the Buyer shall promptly
(but in any event within five Business Days following the determination of the
Final Adjustment Amount) deliver to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to
the Stockholders (based on their Consideration Percentages) a number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (i) the excess of the Final Adjustment Amount
over the estimated Adjustment Amount set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement,
_by_ (ii) $11. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the estimated
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement, then the Buyer and
the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver



 

18  from the Buyer Holdback Amount to the Buyer a number of fully paid non-
assessable shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by _dividing_ (i) the excess of the estimated Adjustment Amount set
forth in the Pre-Closing Statement over the Final Adjustment Amount, _by_ (ii)
$11. All consideration payable pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be treated
by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the consideration payable
by the Buyer under Article III.

3.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Preferred Stock held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected such demand for appraisal of such holders
shares of Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and as of the Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such
holders right to such appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive any portion of the consideration payable
in accordance with Article III, but shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL. The Buyer shall be entitled to retain any portion of
the Aggregate Exchange Buyer Common Stock and the Aggregate Exchange Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock payable by the Buyer under Article III that would
otherwise have been paid to holders of such Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of such holders, and the Stockholders shall not be
entitled to any portion thereof.

 

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.5(a), if any holder of shares of Company Preferred Stock who
demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Company Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable
consideration payable by the Buyer under Article III, without interest
thereon, as and when payable pursuant to this Agreement, following the
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Company Preferred Stock.

 

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall give the Buyer: (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Preferred
Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company; and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Preferred Stock or offer to settle any such
demands other than by operation of law or pursuant to a final order of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

 

3.6 _Escrow of Buyer Holdback Amount_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement the Buyer
Holdback Amount, which shall be represented by 1,727,272.7 shares of Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock (based on a value of $11 per share of Buyer Series A
Preferred Stock). The Buyer Holdback Amount shall be used to satisfy any
claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification pursuant to
Article VII or Article XI, if any, made from and after the Closing but on or
before the applicable Expiration Date, or to cover any payments required from
the Stockholders by Section 3.4, in each case, based on a value of $11 per
share of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock. For example, if a Buyer Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive an amount equal to $1,100,000 as
an indemnification pursuant to Article XI, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall
receive 100,000 shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock ( _i.e._ , $1,100,000
divided by $11) from the Buyer Holdback Amount. Any shares of Buyer Series
A Preferred Stock of the Buyer Holdback Amount not so used to satisfy any
claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification pursuant to
Article VII or Article XI or to cover any payments pursuant to Section 3.4 on
or before the applicable Expiration Date (other than such shares of Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock with respect to which the Buyer notifies the

any Company Licenses or renewals thereof. Each Company License is valid and in
full force and effect. There are no Actions by any Governmental Authority
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that would reasonably
be expected to result in the termination, revocation, suspension or
restriction of any Company License or the imposition of any fine, penalty or
other sanction or Liability for violation of any Law or Order relating to any
Company License. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not in material default,
nor have they received any written notice of, nor is there, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any Action or threatened claim of default, with respect to
any such Company License. Except as otherwise governed by Law, each License is
renewable by its terms, or in the ordinary course of business without the need
to comply with any special qualification procedures or to pay any amounts
other than routine filing fees. The Company Licenses are sufficient for the
Buyer to carry on the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and
after the Closing in all material respects as presently carried on by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. 

4.24 _Accounting Controls_. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain
internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Such
accounting controls of the Company and its Subsidiaries are and for the past
three (3) completed fiscal years have been sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (a) all transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific 



 

34  authorization and are properly reflected in the Companys financial
statements under GAAP, and (b) all transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit the accurate preparation of financial statements in accordance with
the Balance Sheet Rules and to maintain proper accountability for such items.

4.25  _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.25_,
none of the Stockholders, any Affiliate of any Stockholder (other than the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries), any officer, director or Affiliate of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any immediate family member of any
of the foregoing Persons is a party to or the beneficiary of any Contract with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or has any interest in any property
used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For avoidance of doubt,
_Schedule 4.25_ shall contain (i) a list of any and all Contracts pursuant to
which payments are to be made under clauses (b) and (d) of the definition
of Transaction Expenses and (ii) any and all amounts payable thereunder.

4.26 _Brokers_. Except for the fees, costs and expenses set forth on
_Schedule 4.26_, which will be paid by the Company at or prior to the Closing
and shall be deemed a Transaction Expense hereunder if not so paid by the
Company prior to Closing, there are no claims for brokerage fees, costs and
expenses, commissions, finders fees, costs and expenses, financial advisory
fees, costs and expenses or similar compensation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any Contract made by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.27 _Cost Reports_. Each Home Health Agency, as applicable, has timely
made all filings of required cost, government or other reports due prior to
the Closing Date, including Medicare and Medicaid cost reports (collectively,
the " _Cost Reports_ "). All Cost Reports for years prior to 2009 have been
closed, the 2009 Cost Reports have been filed and are true, correct and
accurate in all material respects and all information compiled to date for the
2010 Cost Reports is true, correct and accurate in all material respects. No
Cost Report indicates, and no audit has resulted in, any determination that
any Home Health Agency was overpaid for Medicare or Medicaid in any of the
most recent three fiscal years covered by such audit. To the Companys
Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist which would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any material disallowance under any such Cost Reports.

 

4.28 _Payors and Merger_. Set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ is a true, complete
and current list of all payors of each Home Health Agency. The Company has no
Knowledge that any of these payors intend to cease doing business with such
Home Health Agencies or to materially alter the amount of the business that
they are presently doing with such Home Health Agencies, except for
alterations resulting from changes in applicable Law and regulations, renewals
in the ordinary course of business that likely will not have an adverse impact
on earnings, and changes in the operations of contracts and programs in which
such Home Health Agencies participates. Except as reflected in the Financial
Statements, none of the Company nor any Home Health Agency has liability for
any overpayment, duplicate payments, refunds, discounts, or adjustments
due to any Medical Reimbursement Program or third party payor, nor has any
material Action with respect to such items been made or threatened by any such
payor.

 

4.29 _Health Care Compliance_.

 

(a) The Home Health Agencies, as listed on _Schedule 4.29_, maintain Medicare
and Medicaid provider status and are the holder of the provider
identification numbers and national provider identifiers ( _i.e._ , NPIs) set
forth on _Schedule 4.29_, all of which are current and valid and neither the
Company nor any of the Home Health Agencies have allowed, permitted,
authorized or caused any other person or entity to use any such provider
identification number except as permitted by Law. The Home Health Agencies, as
listed on _Schedule 4.29_, participate in the state Medicaid waiver programs
set forth on _Schedule 4.29_ and have valid, current contracts, as necessary
in order to conduct its current business, for each such Medicaid waiver
program. The Home Health Agencies, as listed on _Schedule 4.29_,
are certified under Medicare Part A. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
basis exists for the denial of state home health licensure which the Company
acknowledges will be filed due to the change in ownership of the Home Health
Agencies occurring on the Closing Date.



 

35 (b) The Company and each Home Health Agency is and has for the past two (2)
years been in compliance in all material respects with all valid and
enforceable Laws and Orders applicable to it (including formal guidance,
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services manuals and Orders relating to
environmental, occupational, and health standards, Medicare, Medicaid,
Medicare conditions of participation for home health agencies, home health
licensing laws and regulations, antitrust, monopoly, restraint of trade or
unfair competition). Without limiting the foregoing, each Home Health Agency,
as applicable, has performed its billing, coding and collections activities in
material compliance with the Laws and Orders applicable to it except where the
failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would
not reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, no audit or other inquiry or
investigation by any Governmental Authority has resulted in any
determination, allegation or information that a Home Health Agency was
overpaid by any Medical Reimbursement Program in any of the most recent three
fiscal years covered by such audit. The Home Health Agencies do not have any
material liability to any Medical Reimbursement Program, and no deductions or
disallowances under any Medical Reimbursement Program, or basis for repayment
to any Medical Reimbursement Program exist with respect to operations prior to
the Closing Date. There are no facts or circumstances which may reasonably be
expected to give rise to any reimbursement obligation to a Medical
Reimbursement Program or assessment of fines, penalties, or interest by a
Governmental Authority or a Medical Reimbursement Program.

(d) As of the Closing, no Medicare certified Home Health Agency have undergone
a change of control or ownership for purposes of Medicare certification or
was initially enrolled in Medicare within the thirty-six month period
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, during the prior two (2) year period, no
audit, survey, inspection, monitoring or investigation of the Home Health
Agencies by any Governmental Authority has resulted in a citation, deficiency,
violation or other item of noncompliance (collectively referred to herein as "
_Deficiencies_ ") being asserted or any Action being taken. In the event that
any Deficiencies have been asserted against the Company during the prior two
(2) year period, all such Deficiencies have been corrected and a plan of
correction has been filed and implemented for any currently outstanding
Deficiencies. With respect to the business and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the Companys Knowledge all licensed health care staff or
providers employed or contracted by the Company have current and valid
licenses in good standing and none of such licenses have been revoked,
suspended, or had any other enforcement action taken within the prior three
years.

 

(f) With respect to the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, without limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of the

the offer, sale, and issuance of the Buyer Stock (and the Buyer Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Buyer Series A Preferred Stock) in conformity
with the terms of this Agreement are exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and all applicable state
securities laws, and neither the Buyer nor any authorized agent acting on its
behalf will take any action hereafter that would cause the loss of
such exemptions.

5.5 _Litigation_. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
threatened Actions before or by any Governmental Authority against the Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of
each of the Buyer, Merger Sub and LLC Sub to enter into and perform its
obligations under any Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party
or a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Buyer.

 

5.6 _Valid Issuance of Buyer Stock_. The Buyer Stock being issued
hereunder, when issued, sold, and delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable, and will be free of any Liens or restrictions on transfer other
than restrictions under this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement,
the Registration Rights Agreement, the Series A Certificate of Designations
(with respect to the Buyer Series A Preferred Stock) and under applicable
state and federal securities Laws. The shares of the Buyer Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock
issued under this Agreement have been duly and validly reserved for issuance
and, upon issuance in accordance with the terms of the Series A Certificate of
Designations, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable
and will be free of any Liens or restrictions on transfer, other than
restrictions under this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Series A Certificate of Designations and
under applicable state and federal securities Laws. The sale of the Buyer
Stock is not, and the subsequent conversion of the Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock into Buyer Common Stock will not be, subject to any preemptive rights,
rights of first offer or any anti-dilution provisions contained in the Buyers
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other agreement.

 

5.7 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Buyer consists of
200,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, of which 45,957,949 (including

42  the Buyer) were issued and outstanding as of July 26, 2010, and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01, none of which are issued and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. All issued and outstanding

Stockholders Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, preemptive rights, rights of first
offer, or similar rights for the purchase or acquisition from the Buyer of
any securities of the Buyer, nor are there any commitments to issue or

first offer (other than rights, options, warrants or similar rights to
purchase or acquire from the Buyer any securities of the Buyer which may be
granted, at or following the Closing, to employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries). Except as otherwise provided in the Series A Certificate of
Designations, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
rights or obligations of the Buyer to repurchase or redeem any of its equity
securities (other than such rights or obligations of the Buyer arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the termination of employment of any of the
Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries employees). The respective rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock and the Buyer Common Stock are as stated in the certificate
of incorporation (including the Series A Certificate of Designations) of the
Buyer. As of the date of this Agreement, the Buyer does not have outstanding
shareholder purchase rights or "poison pill" or any similar arrangement in

or furnished prior to the date hereof and except to the extent that any
information contained in any of the Buyer SEC Reports is required to be

respect of such information would cause such information disclosed not to be
misleading, none of such Buyer SEC Reports contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business
activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, including the

43 5.11 _No Material Adverse Effect_. Since March 31, 2010 through the date
hereof, neither the Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or has agreed
to take any action which if taken after the date hereof would require the
consent of the Company in accordance with Section 6.17 and, since March 31,
2010, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and no circumstance has arisen which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

5.12 _Vote Required_. The only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Capital Stock of the Buyer necessary in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions is the Stockholder Approvals.

Reorganization_.

 

(a) The Buyer is not an "investment company" as defined in Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii).

 

(b) LLC Sub has been, at all times since its formation, wholly owned by Buyer
and Buyer has made no election to treat LLC Sub as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes.

(c) The Buyer has no present plan or intention, following the Mergers, to
cause the Surviving Company to issue any additional LLC interests in a manner
that would cause the Mergers to fail to be treated as a reorganization under
Section 368\.

 

(d) Buyer has no present plan or intention to reacquire any of the Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock issued in the First Merger in a manner that would
cause the Mergers to fail to be treated as a reorganization under Section 368;
it being understood that any transactions contemplated herein with respect to
the Buyer Holdback Amount and the conversion of the shares of Buyer Series A
Preferred Stock into Buyer Common Stock shall not be treated as reacquisitions
for purposes of this representation.

 

(e) Following the Mergers, the Buyer will continue the Companys historic
business or use a significant portion of the Companys historic business
assets in a business as required by Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(f) Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action that would prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

use its reasonable diligent efforts to cause such lenders and the other
Persons providing such Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise enforce its rights under the Financing Agreements. In the event that
Buyer is unable to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing the
Financing to fund on the Closing Date and is unable to enforce its rights

efforts to arrange and obtain alternate Financing on financial terms 



 

47  (including with respect to commitment fees, interest rate, pre-payment

non-public information and using commercially reasonable efforts to update any
such information to the extent contained in an offering document if the
Company becomes aware of any new material information, (ii) facilitating and
promoting negotiations between the Buyer and the existing senior lenders to
the Company, participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions with prospective Financing sources and sessions with rating
agencies, (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency

of the Financing, the Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos, trademarks and service marks. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, none of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection
with the financing contemplated by the Financing prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) Each party acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of each party with

such further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions

precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

an amendment, modification or creation of any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, practice, agreement or arrangement, including of any Company Plan,

this Agreement, (iii) guarantee employment of any employee for any period of
time after the Closing or preclude the ability of the Buyer or any of its

required by Law, the Buyer and the Surviving Company shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company to contain provisions
relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any
current or former officers and directors that are no less favorable to such
Persons than those contained in the Companys certificate of incorporation or
bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. In addition, for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Surviving Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses of any current or former officers and directors
(including the provisions contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence)
unless required to do so by Law, it being the intent of the parties that such
Persons shall continue to be entitled to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the fullest extent that a Delaware corporation can
provide such protections to its directors and officers.

 

(b) The Surviving Company shall maintain in effect for three years from the
Effective Time, substitute directors and officers liability insurance
policies with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time
containing aggregate coverage limits in an amount not less than the aggregate
coverage limits contained in the directors and officers liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company as of the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) more than an amount per year equal to 200%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be Forty-Six Thousand Eight
Hundred Fourteen Dollars ($46,814) in the aggregate); _provided_ ,  _however_
, that in the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such
policies, the Buyer or the Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each current and former officer, director or similar

other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

hand, including any and all Contracts (other than any Transaction Document)
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or
more of its Affiliates (including the Stockholders but not including the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be terminated
in full, without any Liability to the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates. Upon the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Buyer reasonably satisfactory evidence of each such termination.

6.12 _Stockholder Approvals; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to call and hold
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date a meeting of
the stockholders of the Buyer to obtain the Stockholder Approvals (the "
_Stockholder Meeting_ "), and as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement to be sent to the Buyers stockholders in connection with the
Stockholder Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to filing the Proxy Statement with the SEC, the Buyer shall provide the
Representative the opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement,
which comments shall reasonably be considered by the Buyer. Subject to the
directors fiduciary duties as determined in good faith by the Buyers Board
of Directors after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Buyers Board of Directors recommendation that
the stockholders vote in favor of the Stockholder Approvals and the Buyers
Board of Directors shall not



 

49  withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
the Company or its Stockholders, such recommendation. If the Stockholder
Approvals are not obtained at the Stockholder Meeting, then the Buyer will
use its commercially reasonable efforts (including continuing to include the
recommendation of the Buyers Board of Directors subject to the directors
fiduciary duties as determined in good faith by the Buyers board of
Directors after consultation with outside legal counsel) to obtain the
Stockholder Approvals at the next occurring annual meeting of the stockholders

53 ARTICLE VII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

7.1 _Consistent Tax Reporting_. None of the parties herein nor any of their
Affiliates will (i) take any position on an applicable income Tax Return that

characterized as a merger of Company into Buyer that constitutes a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) the Code, other
than in connection with a Final Determination following a challenge by a
Taxing Authority; (ii) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any
action which action or failure to act would prevent, or would be reasonably

7.2 _Tax Covenants_. From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:

material amended Tax Returns;

(h) effective as of the Closing Date, terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements to
which it is a party such that there is no further liability thereunder other
than any Tax Sharing Agreements solely among the Company and any of its

Loss_ " and collectively, the " _Tax Losses_ ") arising out of (i) Taxes of
the Company or its Subsidiaries for periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") in excess of the amount of

Liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6, Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-78 or comparable provision of Law, (iv) without duplication,

another entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no right to
indemnification for any Tax to the extent such Tax was paid or deposited on

of the Aggregate Exchange Buyer Series A Preferred Stock. The obligation under
this Section 7.3(a) shall continue in full force and effect for 24 months
following the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this
Section 7.3(a), if the Buyer or the Representative, as applicable, delivers
written notice to the other party of a claim for indemnification for a breach

or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement within the applicable
Expiration Date, such claim shall survive until finally resolved or

(" _Post-Closing Taxes_ "), other than amounts for which a Tax Indemnified
Buyer Party is indemnified under Section 7.3(a).

parties hereto to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the consideration payable pursuant to Article III for all Tax

determination.

 

7.4 _Tax Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) After the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the
other party (or the Representative as the case may be) in writing of any
demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit received by such party
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person with respect to Taxes for
which such other party is liable pursuant to Section 7.3; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not affect such other
partys rights to indemnification under this Article VII, except to the extent
that such party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax
Liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or
other document received from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person in respect of any such asserted Tax Liability.

(b) Payment by an indemnitor of any amount due to an indemnitee under Article
VII shall be made within ten days following written notice by the indemnitee
that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority or

applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with Section 7.5, payment of such contested Tax will not be considered due
earlier than the date



 

55  a "final determination" to such effect is made by such Governmental
Authority or a court. For this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a
settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Governmental
Authority, whether contained in an IRS Form 870 or other comparable form, or
otherwise, or such procedurally later event, such as a closing agreement with
the relevant Governmental Authority, an agreement contained in IRS Form
870-AD or other comparable form, an agreement that constitutes a
"determination" under Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a deficiency notice with
respect to which the period for filing a petition with the Tax court or the
relevant Government Authority has expired or a decision of any court of
competent jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time
for appeal has expired.

 

(c) Any payments required pursuant to this Article VII that are not made
within the time period specified in this Section 7.4 shall bear interest at a
rate and in the manner provided in the Code for interest on underpayments of

(a) After the Closing, the Buyer shall control the conduct, through counsel of
its own choosing, of any audit, claim for refund or administrative or

refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax Liability referred to herein
as a " _Contest_ "). Buyer shall promptly notify the Representative upon
receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) of written notice of any inquiries,
claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating
to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which the
Company may be liable under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim,
assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Neither the Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any Tax Matter that adversely affects or may adversely affect the
Tax liability of the Representative, the Stockholders of the Company (as of
prior to the Closing) or any Affiliate of the foregoing for any period ending
after the Closing Date without the consent of the Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Buyer shall keep
the Representative fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of any Tax Matter. The Buyer shall, in good faith, allow the
Representative to make comments to the Buyer regarding the conduct of
or positions taken in any such proceeding.

(b) The Representative shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Buyer,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access
to books and records) and assistance relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and
the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyer in the
conduct of any Contest or other proceeding involving or otherwise relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their income or assets) with respect to
any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other
documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 7.5(b). Any
information obtained under this Section 7.5(b) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax Action.

 

7.6 _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file (or
cause to be filed) all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
required to be filed with any Governmental Authority after the Closing Date,
and shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. With respect to any Tax Returns filed with respect to any taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (the "
_Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_ "), the Stockholders shall be responsible for
the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, to the extent that
the aggregate amount of Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of all such Tax
Returns exceeds the amount of Taxes that are included as Current Liabilities,
paid or deposited (net of any Taxes that are included as Current Assets), on
the Closing Balance Sheet. The Buyer shall notify the Representative of any
amounts due from the Stockholders in



 

56  respect of any such Tax Return no later than ten Business Days prior to the
date on which such Tax Return is due, and the Stockholders shall remit such
payment to the Buyer no later than five Business Days prior to the date such
Tax Return is due.

(b) In the case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to a taxable
period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare such
Tax Returns and shall deliver any such Tax Return to the Representative for
its review at least 30 days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to
be filed. If the Representative disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall
notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its
objection, and the Representative and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith
for 15 days following the Buyers receipt of such notice to resolve such
objections. If the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve all
objections during such 15-day period, then any remaining disputes, and only
such remaining disputes, shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining Disputes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30 days after its
appointment. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Representative,
on the other hand.

(c) In the case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to Straddle
Periods, the Buyer shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by Law; _provided_ that the
provisions of this Section 7.6(c) shall apply only to the extent that the
Company is responsible for Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period.

 

7.7 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are payable with respect
to any Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-
Closing Taxes shall (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon
or related to income or receipts, or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount
that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date, and
(b) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in Section 7.7) that are
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period), _multiplied by_ a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of
clause (a) of this Section 7.7, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
(including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that is calculated on an
annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total
amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax
based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section
7.7 shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority to treat a
portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

7.8 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Stockholders shall pay all sales, use, value
added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real property
transfer or gains, or similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and the Stockholders and the Buyer shall

on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such
claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 11.1,
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall
have occurred before or after such date; provided that the failure of the
indemnified party to provide reasonable details of the facts and circumstances

the indemnifying party of its obligations under Article XI.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Losses may be
claimed under Section 11.2(a) (other than with respect to Sections 4.2
(Authorization; Enforceable Agreement), 4.6 (other than the last sentence)

aggregate amount of all individual Losses incurred or sustained by all
Stockholder Indemnified Parties with respect to which the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section 11.4(a)
exceeds the Threshold Amount, in which event, the Buyer shall be liable only
with respect to such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ ,

from special or unique circumstances relating to the Indemnified Party
that could not be reasonably foreseen; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limitation in clause (ii) regarding reasonable foreseeability shall be
disregarded when determining the amount of any Loss based upon, arising out of
or incurred as a result of any breach of, or any inaccuracy in the
representation and warranty in Section 4.35 of this Agreement.

11.6  _Limitation on Remedies_. From and after the Closing, and except
with respect to claims arising from fraud, the enforcement of any covenant
requiring performance following the Closing or claims for equitable relief,

covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

11.7 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the
commencement of any Action involving a third party (such Action, a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto
is to be made against any party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to such
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice
shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Buyer shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of any
Third Party Claim (whether the Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party is
an Indemnified Party or an Indemnifying Party).

 

(c) The Buyer, as an Indemnifying Party in any Third Party Claim, (i) shall
not settle the Third Party Claim unless (A) the settlement does not entail
any admission of liability on the part of any Stockholder Indemnified Party,
and (B) the settlement includes an unconditional release of each Stockholder
Indemnified Party, reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholder Indemnified
Party, from all Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii) shall
indemnify and hold the Stockholder Indemnified Party harmless from and against
any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any settlement or judgment of
such claim and may not claim that it does not have an indemnification
obligation with respect thereto.

 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Any
consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this



 

64  Section 11.7 shall be given by the Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and any consent to be given by the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties under this Section 11.7 shall be given by the Representative acting
on behalf of the Stockholder Indemnified Parties.

11.8 _Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition_. The right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies based on any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in any
Transaction Document or in any document delivered with respect hereto or
thereto will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to,
or any Knowledge or information acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (other than
disclosures made in the Schedules hereto). The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect
the right to indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

11.9 _Additional Matters_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any amounts payable under this
Article XI shall be treated by the Buyer and the Stockholders as adjustments
to the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration.

(b) The amount of any indemnification payment to be made by any Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement shall be reduced to take into account (in assessing
the Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party) any insurance recoveries that
such Indemnified Party has actually received and realized as a result of the
circumstance, event or occurrence giving rise to such underlying claim (net of
any deductible or increase in insurance premiums resulting from such insurance
claim or any other expense incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining
such recovery), and any such recoveries (net of such expenses) received by an
Indemnified Party hereunder following its receipt of indemnification payments
hereunder shall be reimbursed to the Indemnifying Parties to the extent
failure to do so would result in a recovery by the Indemnified Parties of more
than 100% of their Losses.

 

(c) All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article XI shall be
made on an after-Tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the amount of any
indemnification payment for a Loss suffered or incurred by an Indemnified
Party, the amount of such Loss shall be (i) increased to take into account any
additional Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the
receipt of indemnification payments hereunder (" _Tax Costs_ ") and (ii)
decreased to take into account any deduction, credit or other Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss (" _Tax
Benefits_ "). In computing the amount of any such Tax Cost or Tax Benefit, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment
of any indemnified Loss.

66 12.5 _Waiver_. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by any

waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.

rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party
without the prior written consent of the Buyer (in the case of any assignment
by the Company) or the Representative (in the case of any assignment by the
Buyer), and any purported assignment or other transfer without such consent
shall be void and unenforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , that without written
consent of any party hereto, (i) the Buyer may assign its rights and
obligations to any of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Buyer may assign its
rights hereunder as collateral security to any lender to the Buyer or an
Affiliate of the Buyer, but no assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any
Liability hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

12.7 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
any rights, remedies or claims upon any Person not a party or a permitted
assignee of a party to this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 6.10
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers) and Article XI (Indemnification).

 

12.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware.

 

12.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_.

 

(a) Other than an Action by the Buyer for equitable relief as set forth in
Section 12.9(b), any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or, directly
or indirectly arising out of or in any way relating to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any Delaware state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in
any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such Action brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
12.4 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

(b) Nothing contained in Section 12.9(a) shall limit the right of the Buyer to
take any Action against the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction
for the purposes of seeking any equitable remedy or relief, including
injunctions, rescission, or specific performance, nor shall the taking of any
such Action by the Buyer in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of
any such Action in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not) if and
to the extent permitted by Law.

 

12.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



 

67 12.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by it in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that the other parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity.

 

12.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Buyer, the Company and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 

12.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts (and by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)
transmission) with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be
deemed an original of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when, and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

 

12.14 _The Representative_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to
applicable Law and execution of the Stockholder Consent:

(a) _Appointment of the Representative_. Each Stockholder hereby
irrevocably appoints the Representative as such Stockholders true and lawful
attorney-in-fact, proxy and agent, with full powers of substitution and
resubstitution, in such Stockholders name, place and stead, in any and
all capacities, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact, proxy and
agent, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing
requisite and necessary to be done in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as fully to all intents and
purposes as such Stockholder might or could do in person, including for the
purposes of:

 

(i) taking any action on behalf of the Stockholders or any individual
Stockholder that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the
Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with the indemnification
provisions set forth in Article VII or Article XI and the amendment of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 12.2;

 

(ii) taking any action on behalf of the Stockholders or any individual
Stockholder that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the
Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or
entering into settlements, resolutions and compromises with respect to the
adjustments or consideration payable under this Agreement;

 

(iii) accepting notices on behalf of the Stockholders or any individual
Stockholder in accordance with Section 12.4; 

(iv) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Stockholders or any individual
Stockholder, any notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the
Stockholders or any individual Stockholder in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(v) granting any consent or approval on behalf of the Stockholders or any
individual Stockholder under this Agreement. As the representative of the
Stockholders or any individual Stockholder under this Agreement, the
Representative shall act as the representative, agent and proxy for each
Stockholder and shall have authority to bind each Stockholder in accordance
with this Agreement, and no Stockholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.



 

68 The Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including
any fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties and
obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Buyer Reliance_. The Buyer may rely exclusively, without independent
verification or investigation, upon all decisions, communications or writings
made, given or executed by the Representative in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer is
entitled to deal exclusively with the Representative on all matters relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made, given
or executed by the Representative, for or on behalf of any Stockholder, shall
be deemed an action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or
writings made, given or executed by such Stockholder. Any notice or
communication delivered by the Buyer to the Representative shall be deemed to
have been delivered to all the Stockholders. The Buyer shall be entitled to
disregard any decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by
any Stockholder in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless the same is made, given or executed by
the Representative.

(c) _Limitation on the Representative s Liability_. Other than in its
capacity as a Stockholder hereunder and without limitation to its obligations
hereunder in its capacity as the Representative, the Representative shall have
no liability to the Buyer for any default under any this Agreement by any
other Stockholder. Except for fraud, criminal activity, gross negligence or
willful misconduct on its part, the Representative shall have no liability to
any other Stockholder under this Agreement for any act or omission by the
Representative on behalf of the other Stockholders.

(d) _Retention of Counsel_. The Representative shall be entitled to retain
counsel and to incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Representative deems
to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement. The Representative shall be reimbursed for
all such third party fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and expenses) by the Stockholders (other than holders of Company
Series C Preferred Stock), pro rata based on their respective Consideration
Percentage.

(e)  _Survival_. All of the immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement. The Stockholders, by approving this Agreement,
further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Stockholder.

 

(f) _Limitation on the Buyer s Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the Buyer shall not be liable for any Loss to any
Person, including any Stockholder, for any action taken or not taken by the
Representative or for any act or omission taken or not taken in reliance upon
the actions taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by the Representative, including any failure of the
Representative to distribute, or to distribute or sub divide in the correct
consideration payments made to the Representative by the Buyer for delivery
to any Stockholder, among the Stockholders or any other Person; it being
understood that that once the Buyer has made such a consideration payment to
the Representative for delivery to any Stockholder, among the Stockholders or
to such other Person, such consideration payment shall constitute a complete
discharge of the relevant payment obligation of the Buyer.

 

(g) _Replacement of the Representative_. The Representative may be removed
by action of those Stockholders representing a majority of the Consideration
Percentage and such removal shall be effective upon written notice to the
Representative and the Buyer. If the Representative (i) is removed by the
Stockholders, (ii) dies or terminates its legal existence (if not an
individual), (iii) becomes legally incapacitated, or (iv) resigns from its
position as Representative, then the Stockholders (other than holders of
Company Series C Preferred Stock) shall, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, appoint a replacement Representative, which replacement
Representative shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Such

 



 

69  appointment shall be effective upon delivery of at least two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to the Buyer and, thereafter, the replacement
Representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement. Any obligation of the Buyer to take any action in respect of
the Representative shall be suspended during any period that the position of
Representative is vacant.

 

12.15 _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the parties has been represented
by and has had an opportunity to consult legal counsel in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party by
any Governmental Authority by reason of such party having drafted or being
deemed to have drafted such provision.

2\. _General; Securities Subject to this Agreement_.

 

(a) _Grant of Rights_. The Company hereby grants registration rights to the
Designated Stockholders upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

(b) _Registrable Securities_. For the purposes of this Agreement,
Registrable Securities held by any Designated Stockholder will cease to be
Registrable Securities, when (i) a Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities has been declared effective under the Securities Act
by the Commission and such Registrable Securities have been disposed of
pursuant to such effective Registration Statement, (ii) in the opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the entire amount of the
Registrable Securities held by any Designated Stockholder may be sold in a
single sale, without any limitation as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or (iii) the Registrable
Securities have ceased to be outstanding.

(c) _Holders of Registrable Securities_. A Person is deemed to be a holder
of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns of record Registrable
Securities, or holds an option to purchase, or a security convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for, Registrable Securities whether or not such
purchase, conversion, exercise or exchange has actually been effected. If the
Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or
more Persons with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company may
act upon the basis of the instructions, notice or election received from the
registered owner of such Registrable Securities. Registrable Securities
issuable upon exercise of an option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of another security shall be deemed outstanding for the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Transfer of Registration Rights_.

 

(i) Each Designated Stockholder may transfer or pledge Registrable Securities
with the associated registration rights under this Agreement (including
transfers occurring by operation of law or by reason of intestacy) to a
Permitted Assignee or a pledgee (" _Pledgee_ ") only if (1) such Permitted
Assignee or Pledgee agrees in writing to be bound as a Designated Stockholder
by the provisions of this Agreement, such agreement being substantially in the
form of _Annex A_ hereto, and (2)(A) immediately following such transfer or
pledge, the further disposition or transfer of such Registrable Securities by
such Permitted Assignee or Pledgee would be restricted under the Securities
Act and, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the
entire amount of all such Registrable Securities could not be sold in a
single sale, without any limitation as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or (B) such Permitted Assignee
or Pledgee, together with its Affiliates, beneficially owns
Registrable Securities representing more than 5% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock as of the date of such transfer or pledge. Upon any transfer or
pledge of Registrable Securities other than as set forth in this Section 2(d),
such securities shall no longer constitute Registrable Securities.

(ii) Subject to Section 2(b) hereof, if a Designated Stockholder assigns its
rights under this Agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all
of its Registrable Securities, the Designated Stockholder shall retain its
rights under this Agreement with respect to its remaining
Registrable Securities. If a Designated Stockholder assigns its rights under
this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all of its Registrable
Securities, such Designated Stockholder shall have no further rights or
obligations under this Agreement, except under Section 8 hereof in respect of
offerings in which it participated.



 

5 3\. _Demand Registration_.

 

(a) _Request for Demand Registration_. To the extent permitted by
applicable law and regulations, at any time that the Company is not eligible
to use Form S-3 under the Securities Act in connection with a secondary public
offering of its equity securities after [ _date that is 6 months from date of
this Agreement_ ], the Initiating Holders may make a written request to the
Company to register, and the Company shall

register, under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 or S-8), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(a " _Demand Registration_ "), the number of Registrable Securities stated in
such request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect (i) more than two such Demand Registrations, (ii) a Demand
Registration if the Initiating Holders propose to sell Registrable Securities
in such Demand Registration at an anticipated aggregate offering price
(calculated based upon the Market Price of the Registrable Securities on the
date on which the Company receives the written request for such Demand
Registration) to the public of less than $20,000,000 unless such Demand
Registration includes all of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities or
(iii) any such Demand Registration within the Specified Period (or such
shorter period as the Company may determine in its sole discretion) after the
effective date of any other Registration Statement of the Company (other than
a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, two or more Registration Statements related to the same offering by
virtue of Rule 462(b) filed in response to one demand shall be counted as one
Demand Registration. In addition, if (1) the Board of Directors, in its good
faith judgment, determines that any registration of Registrable Securities
should not be made or continued because it would materially impede, delay or
interfere with any material financing, offer and sale of securities,
acquisition, merger, tender offer, business combination, corporate
reorganization or other significant transaction involving the Company or
because such registration would require the Company to disclose material
nonpublic information that would not otherwise be required to be disclosed
under applicable law and (2) the Company has a bona fide business purpose
for preserving the confidentiality of such proposed transaction or
information (a " _Valid Business Reason_ "), (x) the Company may postpone
filing a Registration Statement (but not the preparation of the Registration
Statement) relating to a Demand Registration until such Valid Business Reason
no longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety days after the date
when the Demand Registration was requested or, if later, after the occurrence
of the Valid Business Reason and (y) in case a Registration Statement has
been filed relating to a Demand Registration, the Company may postpone
amending or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the
Valid Business Reason no longer exists or if more than ninety days have
passed since such postponement, the Initiating Holders may request a new
Demand Registration (which request shall not be counted as an additional
Demand Registration for purposes of clause (i) above) or request the
prompt amendment or supplement of such Registration Statement). The Company
shall give written notice to all Designated Stockholders of its determination
to postpone filing, amending or supplementing a Registration Statement and of
the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement no longer
exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may not postpone a
filing, amendment or supplement under this Section 3(a) due to a Valid
Business Reason more than once in any six-month period. Each request for a
Demand Registration by the Initiating Holders shall state the type and amount
of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of
disposition thereof.

(b) _Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Rights with Respect to a Demand
Registration_. Any Designated Stockholder which has not requested a
registration under Section 3(a) hereof may, pursuant to this Section 3(b),
offer its Registrable Securities under any Demand Registration. The Company
shall (i) as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five Business
Days after the receipt of a request for a Demand Registration from the
Initiating Holders, give written notice thereof to all of the
Designated Stockholders (other than Initiating Holders which have requested a
registration under Section 3(a) hereof), which notice shall specify the type
and number of Registrable Securities subject to the request for Demand
Registration, the names of the Initiating Holders and the intended method of
disposition of such Registrable Securities, and (ii) subject to Section 3(e)
hereof, include in the Registration Statement filed pursuant to the Demand
Registration all of the Registrable Securities held by such Designated
Stockholders from whom the



 

6  Company has received a written request for inclusion therein within five
Business Days of the date on which such Designated Stockholders received the
written notice referred to in clause (i) above. Each such request by such
Designated Stockholders shall specify the type and number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be registered. The failure of any Designated
Stockholder to respond within such five Business Day period referred to in
clause (ii) above shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Designated
Stockholders rights under this Section 3(b) with respect to such Demand
Registration. Any Designated Stockholder may waive its rights under
this Section 3(b) by giving written notice to the Company.

(c) _Effective Demand Registration_. Subject to Section 3(a), the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among
other things, accounting and regulatory matters) to file a Registration
Statement relating to the Demand Registration and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than one hundred twenty days
after it receives a request under Section 3(a) hereof and to remain
continuously effective for the lesser of (i) the period during which all
Registrable Securities registered in the Demand Registration are sold or (ii)
one hundred twenty days; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a registration shall
not constitute a Demand Registration if (x) after such Demand Registration has
become effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or distribution
of Registrable Securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or other
governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the Designated
Stockholders and such interference is not thereafter eliminated or (y) the
conditions specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in
connection with such Demand Registration are not satisfied or waived as a
result of an action or inaction by the Company.

 

(d) _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 3(g) or 7(d) hereof, the
Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with a Demand
Registration, whether or not such Demand Registration becomes effective.

 

(e) _Underwriting Procedures_. If the Majority Initiating Holders so elect,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
offering made pursuant to such Demand Registration pursuant to this Section 3
to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten public offering and the
managing

 

underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be the Approved
Underwriter selected in accordance with Section 3(f) hereof. In connection
with any Demand Registration under this Section 3 involving an underwritten
public offering, none of the Registrable Securities held by any Designated
Stockholder making a request for inclusion of such Registrable Securities
pursuant to Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof shall be included in such underwritten
public offering unless such Designated Stockholder accepts the terms of the
offering as agreed upon by the Company, the Majority Initiating Holders
and the Approved Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price,
underwriting commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms), and then
only in such quantity as set forth below. If the Approved Underwriter advises
the Company that the aggregate amount of such Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a
material adverse effect on the distribution or sales price of the Registrable
Securities in such offering, then the Company shall include in such Demand
Registration, to the extent of the amount that the Approved Underwriter
believes may be sold without causing such material adverse effect, _first_ ,
such number of Registrable Securities of the Designated Stockholders that are
participating in such offering pursuant to Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, which
Registrable Securities shall be allocated pro rata among such Designated
Stockholders participating in the offering, based on the number
of Registrable Securities held by each such Designated Stockholder, _second_
, any other securities of the Company requested by any other holders thereof
to be included in such registration, pro rata among such other holders based
on the number of securities held by each such holder, and _third_ ,
securities offered by the Company for its own account.

 

(f) _Selection of Underwriters_. If any Demand Registration or S-3
Registration, as the case may be, of Registrable Securities is in the form of
an underwritten public offering, the Company shall select and obtain one or
more investment banking firms of national reputation to act as the managing
underwriter or underwriters of the offering;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
such firm or firms shall, in any case, also be approved



 

7  by the Majority Initiating Holders or Majority Shelf Take-Down Stockholders,
as the case may be, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
An investment banking firm or firms selected pursuant to this Section 3(f)
shall be referred to as the " _Approved Underwriter_ " herein.

 

(g) _Withdrawal_. The Majority Initiating Holders shall be entitled to
withdraw or revoke a request for a Demand Registration without the prior
written consent of the Company if (i) such withdrawal or revocation is as a
result of facts or circumstances arising after the date on which a request for
a Demand Registration was made and the Majority Initiating Holders reasonably
determine that participation in such registration would have a material
adverse effect on the Initiating Holders or (ii) the Initiating Holders agree
to pay all fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such
withdrawn registration (each, a " _Permitted Withdrawal_ "). If a Permitted
Withdrawal occurs under clause (i) above, the related Demand Registration
shall be counted as a Demand Registration for purposes of Section 3(a)
hereof, and if a Permitted Withdrawal occurs under clause (ii) above, the
related Demand Registration shall not be counted as a Demand Registration for
purposes of Section 3(a) hereof. Any Permitted Withdrawal shall constitute
and effect an automatic withdrawal by all other Initiating Holders and any
other Designated Stockholder participating in such Demand Registration
pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof.

 

4\. _Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration_.

 

(a) _Request for Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration_. After [ _date
that is 6 months from date of this Agreement_ ], if the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement with respect to an offering of Common Stock by
the Company for its own account (other than a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 or S-8) or for the account of any stockholder of the Company other than
Designated Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3 and 5 hereof, then the Company
shall give written notice (an " _Incidental Registration Notice_ ") of such
proposed filing to each of the Designated Stockholders at least ten Business
Days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the
proposed registration and distribution and offer such Designated Stockholders
the opportunity to register the number of Registrable Securities that each
such Designated Stockholder may request (an " _Incidental Registration_ ").
Any such request by a Designated Stockholder must be made in writing and
received by the Company within five Business Days of the date on which the
Designated Stockholder received the Incidental Registration Notice. The
failure of any Designated Stockholder to respond to an Incidental Registration
Notice within five Business Days shall be deemed a waiver of such
Designated Stockholders rights under this Section 4(a) with respect to such
Incidental Registration. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of a
proposed underwritten public offering (the " _Company Underwriter_ ") to
permit each Designated Stockholder who has requested in writing to participate
in the Incidental Registration pursuant to this Section 4(a) to include the
number of such Designated Stockholders Registrable Securities indicated by
such Designated Stockholder in such offering on the same terms and conditions
as the Common Stock of the Company or the account of such other stockholder,
as the case may be, included therein. Any withdrawal of the Registration
Statement by the Company for any reason shall constitute and effect an
automatic withdrawal of any Incidental Registration related thereto. In
connection with any Incidental Registration under this Section 4(a) involving
an underwritten public offering, the Company shall not be required to include
any Registrable Securities in such underwritten public offering unless the
Designated Stockholders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten public
offering as agreed upon between the Company, such other stockholders, if any,
and the Company Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price,
underwriting commissions or discounts and lock-up agreement terms), and then
only in such quantity as set forth below. If the Company Underwriter
determines that the aggregate amount of the securities requested to be
included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse
effect on the distribution or sales price of the securities in such offering,
then the Company shall include in such Incidental Registration, to the extent
of the amount that the Company Underwriter believes may be sold without
causing such material adverse effect, _first_ , (i) all of the securities to
be offered for the account of the Company, in the case of a Company initiated
Incidental Registration or (ii) all of the securities to be offered for the
account of the stockholders who have requested such Incidental Registration,
in the case of a stockholder initiated Incidental Registration, _second_ , any
Registrable Securities and any

 



 

8  other shares of Common Stock requested by holders thereof (including the
Designated Stockholders) to be included in such registration (to the extent
that the holders of such securities do not have priority to be included in
such registration), pro rata among the Designated Stockholders and such other
holders based on the number of securities held by each such holder, and
_third_ , all of the securities to be offered for the account of the Company,
in the case of an Incidental Registration initiated by any stockholder of the
Company.

(b)  _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7(d) hereof, the Company
shall bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any Incidental
Registration pursuant to this Section 4, whether or not such
Incidental Registration becomes effective.

5\. _Form S-3 Registration_.

 

(a) _Form S-3 Registration_. On the date that is 120 days following the
date of this Agreement, (the " _Target Filing Date_ "), if the Company is
eligible to use Form S-3 under the Securities Act in connection with a
secondary public offering of its equity securities, the Company shall register
under the Securities Act on Form S-3 (an " _S-3 Registration_ ") the sale of
all of the Registrable Securities owned by the Designated Stockholders on the
date hereof (which S-3 Registration shall be a shelf registration pursuant to
Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act). Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a
Registration Statement relating to the S-3 Registration (taking into account,
among other things, accounting and regulatory matters) and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective, in each case, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
one hundred twenty days after the Target Filing Date. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, if the Registration Statement for an S-3 Registration ceases
to be effective after the third anniversary of its effectiveness, if the
Company is eligible to use Form S-3 under the Securities Act in connection
with a secondary public offering of its equity securities, at the written
request of the Majority Designated Stockholders, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file a new Registration Statement relating
to the S-3 Registration (taking into account, among other things, accounting
and regulatory matters) and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Registration Statement to become effective, in each case, as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than one hundred twenty days
after the prior Registration Statement ceases to be effective; _provided_ ,
that the Designated Stockholders request for inclusion in the new Registration
Statement relating to such S-3 Registration at least $20,000,000 of
Registrable Securities (calculated based upon the Market Price of the
Registrable Securities on the date which the Majority Designated Stockholders
make such request). If the Majority S-3 Participating Stockholders
request, and if the Company is a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer, the Company
shall cause such S-3 Registration to be made pursuant to an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement and may omit the names of the S-3 Participating
Stockholders and the amount of the Registrable Securities to be offered
thereunder. Any Registration Statement filed under this Section 5(a) shall be
referred to as a " _Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement_."

 

(b) _Form S-3 Underwriting Procedures_. In an Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down, the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering
shall be the Approved Underwriter selected in accordance with Section 3(f)
hereof. In connection with an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, none of the
Registrable Securities held by any Designated Stockholder having such
Registrable Securities included pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof shall be
included in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down unless such Designated
Stockholder accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the Company,
the Majority Shelf Take-Down Stockholders and the Approved Underwriter
(including, without limitation, offering price, underwriting commissions and
discounts and lock-up agreement terms) and then only in such quantity as set
forth below. If the Approved Underwriter advises the Company that the
aggregate amount of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the
distribution or sales price of the Registrable Securities in such offering
then the Company shall include in such offering, to the extent of the amount
that the Approved Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such
material adverse effect, _first_ , such number of Registrable Securities of
the Designated Stockholders that are participating in such Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down, which Registrable

 



 

9  Securities shall be allocated pro rata among such Designated Stockholders
participating in such Undewritten Shelf Take-Down, based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by each such Designated Stockholder, _second_ ,
any other securities of the Company requested by any other holders thereof to
be included in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and _third_ , securities
offered by the Company for its own account. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
immediately upon determination of the price at which such Registrable
Securities are to be sold in an offering in an S-3 Registration that is an
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, if such price is below the price which
the Majority Shelf Take-Down Stockholders find acceptable, then such Majority
Shelf Take-Down Stockholders shall then have the right, by written notice to
the Company, to withdraw their Registrable Securities from being included in
such offering;  _provided_ , that such a withdrawal by such Majority Shelf
Take-Down Stockholders shall constitute and effect an automatic withdrawal by
all other S-3 Participating Stockholders.

 

(c) _Limitations on Form S-3 Registrations_. If the Board of Directors
determines that a Valid Business Reason exists, (x) the Company may postpone
filing a Registration Statement relating to an S-3 Registration (but not the
preparation of the Registration Statement) until such Valid Business Reason no
longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety days after the Target
Filing Date or, if later, after the occurrence of the Valid Business Reason
and (y) in case a Registration Statement has been filed relating to an S-3
Registration, the Company may postpone amending or supplementing such
Registration Statement (in which case, if the Valid Business Reason no longer
exists or if more than ninety days have passed since such postponement, the
Majority S-3 Participating Stockholders may request the prompt amendment or
supplement of such Registration Statement or a new S-3 Registration). The
Company shall give written notice to all Designated Stockholders of its
determination to postpone or delay amending or supplementing a Registration
Statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such
postponement or delay no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the
occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may not postpone a filing or delay amending or supplementing a
filing under this Section 5(c) due to a Valid Business Reason more than once
in any six-month period.

 

(d) _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7(d) hereof, the Company
shall bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any S-3 Registration
pursuant to this Section 5, whether or not such S-3 Registration becomes
effective.

 

(e) _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement_. After the Registration
Statement with respect to an S-3 Registration that is an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement becomes effective, upon written request by the S-3
Participating Stockholders, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
after receiving such request, (i) file with the Commission a prospectus
supplement naming the S-3 Participating Stockholders as selling stockholders
and the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered and include, to the
extent not included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, any other information omitted from the Prospectus
used in connection with such Registration Statement as permitted by Rule 430B
promulgated under the Securities Act (including the plan of distribution and
the names of any underwriters, placement agents or brokers) and (ii) pay any
necessary filing fees to the Commission within the time period required.

 

(f) _Shelf Take-Downs_. (i) Any Designated Stockholder (an " _Initiating
Shelf Holder_ ") that holds Registrable Securities included in a Form S-3
Shelf Registration Statement may initiate an offering or sale of all or part
of such Registrable Securities (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ "), in which case
the provisions of this Section 5(f) shall apply.

(ii) If in connection with any Shelf Take-Down, the Majority Shelf Take-Down
Stockholders so elect in a written request delivered to the Company (an "
_Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ "), a Shelf Take-Down may be in the form
of an underwritten public offering (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ ")
and, subject to the limitations set forth in the proviso to Section 5(b), the
Company shall file and effect an amendment or supplement to its Form S-3 Shelf
Registration Statement for such purpose as soon as practicable. Such Majority
Shelf Take-Down Stockholders shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down Notice whether it intends for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to
involve a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show") or
other substantial marketing



 

10  effort by the underwriters (a " _Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ ").
Upon receipt of an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice indicating that such
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down will be a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than ten Business Days
prior to the expected date of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down) give
written notice of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to all other S-3
Participating Stockholders and shall permit the participation of all such S-3
Participating Stockholders that request inclusion in such Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down who respond in writing within five Business Days
after the receipt of such notice of their election to participate. The
provisions of Section 5(b) shall apply with respect to the right of the
Initiating Shelf Holder and any other Shelf Holder to participate in any
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down.

(iii) If any Initiating Shelf Holder desires to effect a Shelf Take-Down that
does not constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (a " _Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), such Initiating Shelf Holder shall
so indicate in a written request delivered to the Company no later than two
Business Days prior to the expected date of such Non-Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total number of
Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such
Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions
required (including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (including the delivery of one or more stock
certificates representing shares of Registrable Securities to be sold in such
Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down), and, subject to the limitations
set forth in Sections 5(a) and (b), the Company shall file and effect
an amendment or supplement to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement for
such purpose as soon as practicable.

6\. _Holdback Agreements_.

(a) _Restrictions on Public Sale by Designated Stockholders_.

 

(i) To the extent requested by the Approved Underwriter or the Company
Underwriter, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten public
offering, each Designated Stockholder (other than any Pledgee) agrees (x) not
to effect any public sale or distribution of any Registrable Securities or of
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
Registrable Securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 (or any
successor rule or regulation) promulgated under the Securities Act, or offer
to sell, contract to sell (including, without limitation, any short sale),
grant any option to purchase or enter into any hedging or similar transaction
with the same economic effect as a sale of, any Registrable Securities and (y)
except as otherwise consented to by the Company, not to make any request for a
Demand Registration or S-3 Registration under this Agreement, in each case,
during the Specified Period following the effective date of such Registration
Statement, except in each case as part of such underwritten public offering.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Pledgee shall be
required to agree to any restriction on its ability to trade in any
securities, including the restrictions set forth in this Section 6(a). The
Designated Stockholders hereby agree that they shall act in good faith with
respect to the restrictions set forth in this Section 6(a) and shall take no
action or omit to take any action with the intention of circumventing or
evading the restrictions applicable to them under this Section 6(a).

 

(b) _Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company_. Unless the Company shall
have received the prior written consent of the Majority Designated
Stockholders, the Company agrees not to (i) effect any public sale or
distribution of any of its securities, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such securities (except pursuant to
registrations on Form S-4 or S-8), (ii) file any Registration Statements
relating to the registration of securities for the Companys account (except
pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or S-8) or (iii) make any public
announcements related to clause (i) or (ii), in each case, during the period
beginning on the effective date of any Registration Statement relating to an
underwritten public offering in which the Designated Stockholders of
Registrable Securities are



 

11  participating pursuant to Section 3 or 5 hereof and ending on the earlier of
(x) the date on which all Registrable Securities registered on such
Registration Statement are sold and (y) the Specified Period after the
effective date of such Registration Statement (except as part of such
registration).

 

7\. _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a) _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever registration of Registrable
Securities has been requested or required pursuant to Section 3, Section 4 or
Section 5 hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable,
and in connection with any such request, the Company shall:

 

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among other
things, accounting and regulatory matters) to prepare and file with the
Commission a Registration Statement on any form for which the Company then
qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which
form shall be available for the sale of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) before filing a
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto
(including, without limitation, any documents incorporated by reference
therein), or before using any Free Writing Prospectus, the Company shall
provide one firm of legal counsel selected by the Designated Stockholders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities being registered in such
registration (" _Designated Stockholders  Counsel_"), any managing
underwriter or broker/dealer participating in any disposition of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and any attorney
retained by any such managing underwriter or broker/dealer (each, an "
_Inspector_ " and collectively, the " _Inspectors_ ") with an opportunity to
review and comment on such Registration Statement and each Prospectus included
therein (and each amendment or supplement thereto) and each Free Writing
Prospectus to be filed with the Commission, subject to such documents being
under the Companys control, and (y) the Company shall notify the Designated
Stockholders Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened by
the Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry
of such stop order or to remove it if entered;

 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the
Commission such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and
the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement effective for the lesser of (x) one hundred twenty days
(or, in the case of an S-3 Registration, three years from the effective date
of the Registration Statement if such Registration Statement is filed pursuant
to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act) and (y) such shorter period
which will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold (or, if such Registration Statement is
an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, on the third anniversary of the
date of filing of such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement); and comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by such Registration Statement during such period in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
forth in such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall be entitled at all reasonable times to suspend a Registration
Statement that includes Registrable Securities during the pendency of any
amendments required by this Section 7(a)(ii). Such suspension or suspensions
shall be effective upon the transmittal of notice to an affected Designated
Stockholder in compliance with, and using the most expeditious practical means
of communication permitted by, Section 10(e) below;

(iii) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities such number of copies
of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in
each case including all exhibits thereto), the Prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), any Prospectus
filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act and any Free Writing Prospectus
as each such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller;

 



 

12 (iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify
such Registrable Securities under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of
such jurisdictions as any seller of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, and continue such registration or qualification in effect in such
jurisdiction for as long as permissible pursuant to the laws of such
jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller requests or until all of such
Registrable Securities are sold, whichever is shortest, and do any and all
other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable any such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of
the Registrable Securities owned by such seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in
any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (y) subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general service of process
in any such jurisdiction;

 

(v) promptly following its actual knowledge thereof, notify each seller of
Registrable Securities: (A) when a Prospectus, any Prospectus supplement, any
Free Writing Prospectus, a Registration Statement or a post-effective
amendment to a Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, and,
with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment,
when the same has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission or
any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or
supplements to a Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus or for additional information; (C) of the receipt by the Company of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such
purpose; and (D) of the existence of any fact or happening of any event of
which the Company has knowledge which makes any statement of a material fact
in such Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference
untrue or which would require the making of any changes in the Registration
Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus in order that, in the case
of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the
case of such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, upon the occurrence of any
event contemplated by Section 7(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Sections 3(a)
and 5(c) hereof, the existence of a Valid Business Reason, prepare a
supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement, related Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus and furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a
reasonable number of copies of such supplement to, or amendment of, such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus as may be
necessary so that, after delivery to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and that in the case of such Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

(vii) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Approved Underwriter or Company
Underwriter, if any, selected as provided in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5
hereof, as the case may be) and take such other commercially reasonable
actions as are reasonably required in order to facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities, including causing its officers to participate in
"road shows" and other information meetings organized by the Approved
Underwriter or Company Underwriter;

 

(viii) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any Inspector all
pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and

13  (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Companys
and its subsidiaries officers, directors and employees, and the independent
public accountants of the Company, to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such Inspector in connection with such Registration
Statement. Records that the Company determines, in good faith, to be
confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not
be disclosed by the Inspectors (and the Inspectors shall confirm their
agreement in writing in advance to the Company if the Company shall so
request) unless (x) the disclosure of such Records is necessary, in the
Companys judgment, to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the
Registration Statement, (y) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant
to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction after
exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the information in such Records was
known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure
by the Company or has been made generally available to the public. Each
seller of Registrable Securities agrees that it shall, upon learning that
disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction,
promptly give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at the Companys
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records
deemed confidential. In the event that the Company is unsuccessful in
preventing the disclosure of such Records, such seller agrees that it shall
furnish only such portion of those Records that it is advised by counsel is
legally required and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to those Records;

(ix) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, obtain a "cold
comfort" letter dated the effective date of the Registration Statement and
the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the Companys
independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as the managing
underwriter reasonably requests;

(x) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, furnish, at the
request of any seller of Registrable Securities on the date such securities
are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration, an
opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the
purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, covering such
legal matters with respect to the registration in respect of which such
opinion is being given as the underwriters may reasonably request and are
customarily included in such opinions;

(xi) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and
make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable but
no later than fifteen months after the effective date of the Registration
Statement, an earnings statement covering a period of twelve months
beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, in a manner
which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 promulgated under the Securities Act;

 

(xii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, within thirty (30)
days of the effective date of the Registration Statement, any shares of
Common Stock included in the Registration Statement to be listed on each
securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, including but
not limited to the New York Stock Exchange, _provided_  that the applicable
listing requirements are satisfied;

(xiii) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each
underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be
made with FINRA;

 

(xiv) cause the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities, as may be reasonably necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the seller or sellers of Registrable
Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(xv) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filings of all Prospectuses and
Free Writing Prospectuses with the Commission;



 

14 (xvi) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the
rules promulgated thereunder, make all required filing fee payments in
respect of any Registration Statement or Prospectus used under this Agreement
(and any offering covered thereby); and

 

(xvii) take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration of
the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby and reasonably cooperate with
the holders of such Registrable Securities to facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities pursuant thereto.

 

(b) _Seller Requirements_. In connection with any offering under any
Registration Statement under this Agreement, each Designated Stockholder (i)
shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect
to such Designated Stockholder and the intended method of disposition of its
Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request or as may be
required by law or regulations for use in connection with any related
Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) and
all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information
previously furnished to the Company by such Designated Stockholder not contain
a material misstatement of fact or necessary to cause such Registration
Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) not to omit
a material fact with respect to such Designated Stockholder necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) shall comply with
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and all applicable state securities
laws and comply with all applicable regulations in connection with the
registration and the disposition of the Registrable Securities; and (iii)
shall not use any Free Writing Prospectus without the prior written consent of
the Company. If any seller of Registrable Securities fails to provide such
information required to be included in such Registration Statement by
applicable securities laws or otherwise necessary or desirable in connection
with the disposition of such Registrable Securities in a timely manner after
written request therefor, the Company may exclude such sellers Registrable
Securities from a registration under Sections 3, 4 or 5 hereof.

 

(c) _Notice to Discontinue_. Each Designated Stockholder agrees that, upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the
kind described in Section 7(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Section 3(a) and

Stockholder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities
until such Designated Stockholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented
or amended Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section
7(a)(vi) hereof (or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus is required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted) and, if so
directed by the Company, such Designated Stockholder shall deliver to the
Company (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in such Designated Stockholders possession, of the Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities which is current
at the time of receipt of such notice. If the Company shall give any such
notice, the Company shall extend the period during which such
Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the period referred to in Section
7(a)(ii) hereof) by the number of days during the period from and including
the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 7(a)(v)(D) hereof
to and including the date when sellers of such Registrable Securities under
such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by and meeting
the requirements of Section 7(a)(v) hereof (or if no supplemental or amended
prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is required, upon confirmation from the
Company that use of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is once again
permitted).

(d) _Registration Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
including but not limited to the last sentence of this Section 7(d), the
Company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to its performance of,
or compliance with, this Agreement, including, without limitation (i) all

underwriting agreement), (v) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses,
(vi) the fees, charges and expenses of counsel to the Company and of its
independent registered public accounting firm and any other accounting fees,

incident to or required by any registration or qualification) and (vii) any
liability insurance or other premiums for insurance obtained in connection
with any Demand Registration or piggy-back registration thereon, Incidental
Registration or S-3 Registration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
regardless of whether such

Registration Statement is declared effective. All of the expenses described
in the preceding sentence of this Section 7(d) are referred to herein as "
_Registration Expenses_." The Designated Stockholders of Registrable
Securities sold pursuant to a Registration Statement shall bear the
expense of any brokers commission or underwriters discount or commission
relating to the registration and sale of such Designated Stockholders
Registrable Securities and shall bear the fees and expenses of their own

8\. _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 

(a) _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Designated Stockholder, its partners, directors, officers,
Affiliates, stockholders, members, employees, trustees and each Person who

Designated Stockholder from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses, or any action or proceeding in respect thereof
(including, but not limited to, reasonable costs and expenses of legal counsel
arising from any investigation, action or proceeding in respect of any of the
foregoing) (each, a " _Liability_ " and collectively, " _Liabilities_ "),

Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free
Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading under the circumstances such statements were made;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be held liable in any such case to the
extent that any such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission contained in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto in
reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning such Designated

hereof. The Company shall also provide customary indemnities to any
underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers, directors and

of Section 15 of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided
above with respect to the indemnification of the Designated Stockholders of
Registrable Securities.

(b)  _Indemnification by Designated Stockholders_. In connection with any

as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Designated Stockholders
(including indemnification of their respective partners, directors, officers,
Affiliates, stockholders, members, employees, trustees and Controlling
Persons), but only to the extent that Liabilities arise out of or are based
upon a statement or alleged statement or an omission or alleged omission that

behalf of such Designated Stockholder expressly for use in such Disclosure
Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such
amendment or supplement thereto, including,



 

16  without limitation, the information furnished to the Company pursuant to
Section 7(b) hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the total amount to be
indemnified by such Designated Stockholder pursuant to this Section 8(b)
shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such Designated Stockholders
in the offering to which such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto
relates.

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled to
indemnification or contribution hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees
to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any
written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the Indemnified
Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits
substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of
commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as
above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense,
with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid
by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the
same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the
named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties have
been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party.
In any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party,
it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all
Indemnified Parties and all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall,
without the consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party is a party and
indemnity has been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9
from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder
or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in
such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action
in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made
by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8(a),
8(b) and 8(c) hereof, any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal or
other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in

 



 

17  connection with any investigation or proceeding; _provided_ , that the total
amount to be contributed by any Designated Stockholder shall be limited to the
net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions)
received by such Designated Stockholder in the offering.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

9\. _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it shall take such action as
may be required from time to time to enable such Designated Stockholder to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any
similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the Commission. The Company
shall, upon the request of any Designated Stockholder, deliver to
such Designated Stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

10\. _Miscellaneous_. 

(a) _Stock Splits, etc_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits,
combinations recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof.

 

(b) _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company hereby represents and
warrants that it has not previously entered into any agreement granting
registration rights to any Person with respect to any securities of the
Company. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its
securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Designated
Stockholders in this Agreement or grant any additional registration rights to
any Person or with respect to any securities that are not Registrable
Securities which rights are inconsistent with the rights granted in
this Agreement.

(c) _Remedies_. The Designated Stockholders, in addition to being entitled
to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be
entitled to specific performance of their rights under this Agreement. The
Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for
any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 

(d) _Amendments and Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given unless consented to in writing by the Company and the Majority
Designated Stockholders; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver or consent to depart from the provisions
hereof shall be effective if such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver
or consent to depart from the provisions hereof materially and adversely
affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Designated Stockholder,
or group of Designated Stockholders, without a similar and proportionate
effect on the substantive rights or obligations of all Designated
Stockholders, unless each such disproportionately affected Designated
Stockholder consents in writing thereto.

(e)  _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications provided for

annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors of

as of such date.

 

(b) At the first annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company
after the Effective Time at which directors of the Company are to be elected
and at any subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company
at which directors of the Company are to be elected, for so long as the
Representatives Ownership Percentage is equal to or greater than 10%, the
Representative, on its own behalf, shall have the right to nominate for
election to the Board one director (the " _Designee_ "), and the Company
shall, at any such annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Company, subject to the fulfillment of the requirements set forth in Section
2.1(c), nominate the Designee for election to the Board and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Designee to be elected as a director of the
Board.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2.1(b), on the date following a
mandatory conversion of the Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of the Certificates of Designations governing the
Company Preferred Stock, the Representative,

 



 

2  on its own behalf, shall cease to have any right to nominate a Designee for
election to the Board and the Company shall have the right to remove such
Designee serving on the Board effective immediately as of such date.

(c) Any designee for election to the Board in accordance with this Section
2 shall (i) be reasonably acceptable to the Board and the Boards Corporate
Governance Committee (the " _Governance Committee_ "), it being agreed that
Wyche H. Walton and Martin Chavez are so acceptable, and (ii) shall comply in
all respects with the Companys corporate governance guidelines and the
Companys code of business conduct and ethics as in effect from time to time.
The Representative shall notify the Company of any proposed Designee in
writing no later than the latest date on which stockholders of the Company
may make nominations to the Board in accordance with the Bylaws, together with
all information concerning such nominee required to be delivered to the
Company by the Bylaws then in effect and such other information reasonably
requested by the Company; _provided_ that in each such case, all such
information is generally required to be delivered to the Company by the other
outside directors of the Company (the " _Nominee Disclosure Information_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ that in the event the Representative fails to provide
any such notice, the Designee shall be the person then serving as the Designee
as long as the Representative provides the Nominee Disclosure Information to
the Company promptly upon request by the Company.

2.2  _Compensation and Benefits_. Each director contemplated by Section
2.1 will be entitled to receive similar compensation, benefits, reimbursement,
indemnification and insurance coverage for their service as directors as the
other outside directors of the Company. Following the Effective Time, for so
long as the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance, the
Company shall include each director contemplated by Section 2.1 as "insured"
for all purposes under such insurance policy for so long as such person is a
director of the Company and for the same period as for other former directors
of the Company when such person ceases to be a director of the Company. 

2.3 _Voting_.

 

(a) In connection with any proposal submitted for Company stockholder approval
(at any annual or special meeting called, or in connection with any other
action (including the execution of written consents)) related to the election
or removal of directors of the Board, each of the Preferred Stockholders will
(i) cause all of its respective shares of Company capital stock that are
entitled to vote, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the "
_Voting Securities_ "), to be present in person or represented by proxy at all
meetings of stockholders of the Company, so that all such shares shall be
counted as present for determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings,
(ii) vote all of its Voting Securities: (x) in favor of any nominee or
director nominated by the Board and/or the Governance Committee ( _provided_
that the Board and the Governance Committee adheres to the terms of Section
2.1) and (y) against the removal of any director nominated by the Board and/or
the Governance Committee and (iii) with respect to any other business or
proposal, vote all of its Voting Securities in accordance with the
recommendation of the Board, other than with respect to the approval of any
proposed business combination (including, without limitation, any
reorganization, merger, tender offer, exchange offer, consolidation, sale of
assets or other similar agreement between the Company and any other Person).

 

(b) Following the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 2.3 shall
terminate, as to any Voting Securities owned by any Preferred Stockholder, on
the first to occur of (x) the date on which such Preferred Stockholders
Ownership Percentage shall fall below 3% and (y) the date on which any
Preferred Stockholder which is a limited partnership Transfers, in accordance
with a plan of distribution or liquidation, the Voting Securities owned by
such Preferred Stockholder to its partners; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such Transfer will result in any transferee owning 3% or more of the
issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company such Preferred Stockholder
will not make a Transfer to such transferee unless and until such transferee
executes a written joinder agreement in a form approved by the Company
pursuant to which such transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of Section
2.3.



 

3 (c) Each Preferred Stockholder covenants and agrees to be present (in
person or by proxy) and vote, for purposes of determining a quorum, all of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such Preferred Stockholder at
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which receipt of the
Stockholder Approval will be sought.

3\. _Restrictions on Transfer_.

 

3.1 _No Transfer of Capital Stock_. Prior to the date that is six (6)
months following the Closing, each of the Preferred Stockholders agrees that
it will not, directly or indirectly, Transfer any portion of any shares of
Company Preferred Stock or shares of Company Common Stock issued upon a
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock to any Person without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent may be given or withheld, or
made subject to such conditions as are determined by the Company, in its sole
discretion) other than (i) to its Affiliates who execute a written joinder
agreement in a form approved by the Company pursuant to which such Affiliate
agrees to be bound by the terms of Sections 2.3, 3 and 4, (ii) pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer recommended by the Board or (iii) pursuant to a
merger or consolidation recommended by the Board. Any purported Transfer which
is not in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 3.1 shall
be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, null and void _ab initio_ and, in
addition to other rights and remedies at law and in equity, the Company shall
be entitled to injunctive relief enjoining the prohibited action. For the
avoidance of doubt, the restrictions contained in this Section 3.1
shall expire and be of no force and effect from and after the date that is
six (6) months following the Closing.

 

3.2 _No Transfer to Competitors_. Each Preferred Stockholder agrees that it
will not at any time directly or knowingly indirectly Transfer any shares of
Company Preferred Stock or any shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock to any Competitor of the Company
without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent may be given
or withheld, or made subject to such conditions as are determined by the
Company, in its sole and absolute discretion); _provided_ , that the
provisions of this Section 3.2 shall not apply to any tender or exchange
offer with respect to a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock
of the Company made by any such Competitor or to any sales made pursuant to
open market transactions through a broker in which the Transferring
Preferred Stockholder does not know, after due inquiry, that the ultimate
purchaser of such Capital Stock is a Competitor.

 

3.3 _No Block Transfers to Individual Persons_. Each Preferred Stockholder
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, individually
or acting together with any other Preferred Stockholder or its Affiliates, at
any time knowingly (after reasonable inquiry), directly or indirectly,
transfer any shares of Company Preferred Stock or any shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Preferred Stock (a) to
any individual Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act) in an amount constituting 5% or more of the voting capital
stock of the Company then outstanding or (b) to any individual Person or
"group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) that,
immediately following such transfer, would beneficially own in the aggregate
more than 15% of the voting capital stock of the Company then outstanding
(other than, in each case of clauses (a) or (b), to (i) any of its Affiliates
(including commonly controlled or managed investment funds) who execute a
written joinder agreement in a form approved by the Company pursuant to which
such Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of Sections 2, 3 and 4 or (ii)
an underwriter in connection with a _bona fide_ public offering or
distribution or a person in a sale made pursuant to open market transactions
through a broker in which the Transferring Preferred Stockholder does not
know, after due inquiry, that the ultimate purchaser of such capital stock
would beneficially own in the aggregate more than 15% of the voting capital
stock of the Company then outstanding).

 

3.4 _Registration Rights Agreement_. Each Preferred Stockholder hereby
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, sell any of

or Section 5 of the Registration Rights Agreement, (i) twenty percent (20%)
of the Registrable Securities owned by such Preferred Stockholder as of the
Closing Date during the period beginning on the date that is six (6) months
from the Closing Date through the date that is twelve (12) months from the
Closing Date and (ii) an additional 20% of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Preferred Stockholder as of the Closing Date during each six-month period
thereafter (for the avoidance of doubt, each additional 20% shall be

Affiliates was otherwise permitted to sell pursuant to this Section 3.4 but
did not sell).

 

4\. _Standstill Restrictions_. Commencing at the Effective Time and
continuing until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, each of the Preferred
Stockholders shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates (including
commonly controlled or managed investment funds) not to, (i) directly or

ownership of any equity or debt securities of the Company, any warrant or

Stockholders and their respective Affiliates), (vi) seek the removal of any
directors from the Board or a change in the size or composition of the Board,

arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether written or oral) with any

5\. _Capital Stock of the Company_. Each Preferred Stockholder represents
and warrants to the Company that, as of the date of this Agreement, neither

therewith.

 

11\. _Confidentiality_.

 

11.1 The Representative and each Preferred Stockholder hereby agree to keep,
and to cause each of its Affiliates and each of their respective employees,
officers, directors, accountants, counsel, consultants,



 

6  advisors and agents to keep, confidential, any and all confidential
information of NF Investors, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries,
including non-public information relating to NF Investors, the Companys and
their respective Subsidiaries finances and results, trade secrets, know-how,
customers, business plans, marketing activities, financial data and other
business affairs that was disclosed by NF Investors or the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement or that is disclosed on or after the date
of this Agreement by NF Investors or the Company or the Designee to the
Representative, any Preferred Stockholder or their respective Affiliates
or representatives (each a " _Receiving Party_ "), (collectively, the "
_Company Proprietary Information_ "), and to utilize the Company Proprietary
Information only for purposes related to the purpose for which
such information was disclosed (the " _Utilization Restriction_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Utilization Restriction shall not restrict
the sale of the shares of Company Preferred Stock or the Company Common Stock
issued upon conversion of the Company Preferred Stock so long as such
Preferred Stockholder complies with the confidentiality restrictions of this
section; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Company Proprietary
Information shall not include any information that (i) is or subsequently
becomes publicly available without breach of this Section 11.1 or (ii) is or
subsequently becomes known or available to a Receiving Party from a source
other than the Company that, to such Receiving Partys knowledge, is not
prohibited from disclosing such Company Proprietary Information to the
Receiving Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation owed by such
other third party to the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
terms of this Section 11.1, any Preferred Stockholder may disclose Company
Proprietary Information to its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates
employees, officers, directors, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents. Each Preferred Stockholder shall be responsible for any failure of
its employees, officers, directors, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to keep confidential the Company Proprietary Information.
The obligation of each Preferred Stockholder to hold and to cause its
Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if it
exercises at least the same care with respect to such information as it would
take to preserve the confidentiality of its own information.

11.2 In the event that any Receiving Party is required by applicable law,
regulation or legal process to disclose any Company Proprietary Information,
then (to the extent reasonably practicable, before substantively responding to
any such request or requirement) such Receiving Party will provide the Company
with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the
Company may (at its sole cost and expense) seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, or both, or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 11.2 or other appropriate remedy, or if the Company so directs, such
Receiving Party will exercise its own commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Company in obtaining a protective order or other appropriate remedy
at the Companys sole cost and expense. If, failing the entry of a protective
order or other appropriate remedy or the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
disclosure of any Company Proprietary Information is required by law,
regulation or legal process then such Receiving Party may furnish only that
portion of the Company Proprietary Information that is required to be so
furnished pursuant to law, regulation or legal process. In any event, such
Receiving Party will, to the extent practicable and permissible by law
cooperate fully with any action by the Company (at its sole cost and expense)
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Company Proprietary Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to
provide the Company with notice of any request for Company Proprietary
Information from any Governmental Authority if disclosing such request would
be in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation or if such request
is received pursuant to regulatory oversight (and the Receiving Party shall be
entitled to comply with any such request without providing such notification).
Furthermore, the provisions of this Section 11.2 shall not apply to any
confidential information of NF Investors or any of its Subsidiaries until the
Effective Time.

12.  _HSR Filings_. Each Preferred Stockholder hereto agrees, if
applicable, to make an appropriate filing of a Pre-Merger Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, to
request early termination of the applicable waiting period and to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each Preferred Stockholder shall pay its
own HSR Act filing fees. Each



 

7  Preferred Stockholder shall use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to secure the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under
the HSR Act and to obtain such other approvals of, and take such action with
respect to, any Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority, as may
be necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall
any Preferred Stockholder or any of its Affiliates be required to (a) commence
or threaten to commence litigation; (b) agree to hold separate, divest,
license or cause a third party to purchase, any of the assets or businesses
of such Preferred Stockholder or any of its Affiliates; or (c) otherwise agree
to any restrictions on the businesses of such Preferred Stockholder or any of
its Affiliates in connection with avoiding or eliminating any restrictions to
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions under any applicable Law or
Order. The Company and any such Preferred Stockholder shall coordinate and
cooperate with one another in exchanging and providing such information to
each other and in making the filings and requests contemplated by this
Section 12\.

it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or similar instrument. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits with

property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the

commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior

or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereby consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 13.7 and agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
(return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 13.7 shall be effective service of process for
any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Paragraph 10.

 

1\. _Employment at Will_.

 

The Company agrees to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to be
employed by the Company upon such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed
upon. Executives employment with the Company shall be at the discretion of
the Company. Executive hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Company may
terminate Executives employment at any time, for any reason, with or without
cause, and without notice. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a)
confer on Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Company, (b)
constitute any contract or agreement of employment, or (c) interfere in
any way with the at-will nature of Executives employment with the Company.

2\. _Severance Benefits_.

 

(a) In the event that the Company terminates Executives employment without
"Cause" (as defined below), the Company agrees to pay to Executive severance
payments in an amount equal to (i) the sum of eighteen (18) months base salary
at the rate in effect on the Termination Date, plus, the prorated portion of
Executives "Average Bonus" (an amount equal to the average of the
performance bonus payments received by the Executive for the three most recent
Fiscal Years, multiplied by the product of the number of days during the
Performance Period that Executive was employed, divided by 365 ("Severance
Benefits"). For purposes of this Average Bonus calculation, if any of the most
recent Fiscal Years used for the calculation is prior to 2010, Executives
bonus for such year(s) will be set at eighty percent (80%) of Executives
target bonus on the Termination Date. For all years after 2009, the actual
Bonus paid will be used for the calculation. The Severance Benefits shall be
payable by mail or direct deposit in equal installments commencing on the
first payroll date after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 4 below and continuing for eighteen (18) months in accordance with the
Companys normal payroll schedule, practices and applicable law. All
withholding taxes and other deductions that the Company is required by law to
make from wage payments to employees will be made from such severance
payments. If Executives employment terminates as a result of death
or disability, such termination shall not be considered a termination without
"Cause" that will entitle Executive to any severance payment.

 

(b) If Executive makes an election to continue Executives coverage under the
Companys group health plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), during the period beginning
on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the eighteenth month
anniversary of the Termination Date or (ii) the date upon which Executive
becomes eligible for comparable coverage under another employers group health
plans, Executive shall continue to pay premiums with respect to such coverage
to the same extent that Executive was paying such premiums immediately prior
to such termination. Such period shall run concurrently with the period of
Executives rights under COBRA.

 

(c) If the Company relocates Executives position to a locale beyond a 50 mile
radius from the Dallas Fort-Worth International Airport, it shall be
considered a termination of Executive without "Cause," entitling Executive to
resign and receive the Severance Benefits.

 

Notwithstanding the following, in order to be eligible to receive the
Severance Benefits under this subsection 2(c), (i) Executive shall provide
notice to the Company no more than 90 days after the occurrence of such
relocation, (ii) such notice states the grounds for such voluntary resignation
and an effective date no earlier than 30 days after it is given, and (iii)
the Company has 30 days from the giving of such notice within which to cure
and, in the event of such cure, such notice shall be of no further force or
effect. (d) In the event a termination without "Cause" occurs within one year after a
"Change in Control," in lieu of the Severance Benefits payable under
subsection 2(a) or (c), as the case may be, Executive shall be entitled to
receive a lump sum equal to two (2) times the sum of Executives twelve (12)
months base salary at the rate in effect on the Termination Date plus the
Average Bonus. Such amount shall be payable on the first payroll date after
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4 below.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as
follows:

 

(i) "Cause" for termination of Executive shall mean (A) Executives failure to
perform in any material respect his or her duties as an employee of the
Company, (B) violation of the Companys Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Principal Executive Officer,
and/or Securities Trading Policy, (C) the engaging by Executive in willful
misconduct or gross negligence which is injurious to the Company or any of its
affiliates, monetarily or otherwise, (D) the commission by Executive of an act
of fraud or embezzlement against the Company or any of its affiliates, or (E)
the conviction of Executive of a crime which constitutes a felony or any
lesser crime that involves Company property or a pleading of guilty or nolo
contendere with respect to a crime which constitutes a felony or any lesser
crime that involves Company property.

(ii) "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon:



     | (A) | The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within
the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a
majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the dissolution or liquidation of the Company; 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the sale of all or substantially all of the business or
assets of the Company; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (D) | the consummation of a merger, consolidation or similar form
of corporate transaction involving the Company that requires the approval of
the Companys stockholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of
securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), if immediately
following such Business Combination: (x) a Person is or becomes the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the combined voting power of
the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent
Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation), or (y) the Companys shareholders cease to beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they owned the
then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to the Business
Combination, a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding
voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or,
if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation). "Surviving
Corporation" shall mean the corporation resulting from a
Business Combination, and "Parent Corporation" shall mean the ultimate parent
corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of a majority
of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the
Surviving Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors. 
---|---|--- 

3\. _No Other Payments_.

 

Executive understands and agrees that the payments and benefits described
above are in lieu of, and discharge, any obligations of the Company to
Executive for compensation, incentive or performance payments, or any other
expectation or form of remuneration or benefit to which Executive may be
entitled, including severance benefits under any Company plan or program,
except for: (i) any unpaid wages due for work performed during any pay
period(s) prior to the Termination Date; (ii) the continuation of Executives
coverage under the Companys group health plans pursuant to COBRA, and (iii)
any amounts payable to Executive under any retirement or savings plan of the
Company in accordance with the terms of any such plan as in effect on the
Termination Date.

 



 

2 4\. _Severance Benefits Conditioned Upon Release_.

 

Executive acknowledges and understands that Executives eligibility for
severance pay and other benefits hereunder is contingent upon Executives
execution and acceptance of the terms and conditions of, and the effectiveness
of the Companys standard Covenant and General Release of All Claims (the
"Release") as in effect on the Termination Date. The Companys standard
Release may be modified from time to time in the Companys discretion as it
deems appropriate. If Executive fails to execute a Release within twenty-one
(21) days of receipt of such Release (or if Executive revokes such Release in
a manner permitted by law or the applicable Release), then Executive shall not
be entitled to any severance payments or other benefits to which Executive
would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement.

 

5\. _Section 409A_.

 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of
Executives separation from service, the Company determines Executive is a
"specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and if any payment
that Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement would be considered
deferred compensation subject to interest and additional tax imposed pursuant
to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section
409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then no such payment shall be payable prior to
the date that is the earlier of (1) six months and one day after Executives
separation from service, or (2) Executives death. If any such delayed cash
payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall
include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been
paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision,
and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their
original schedule. The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered
in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The parties agree that this
Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may
be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related
rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided
hereunder without additional cost to either party. The Company makes no
representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Executive or any
other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy
an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

6\. _Additional Limitation_.

 

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event
that any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Severance
Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code, the following provisions shall apply:

(i) If the Severance Payments, reduced by the sum of (A) the Excise Tax and
(B) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment taxes
payable by Executive on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in
excess of the Threshold Amount, are greater than or equal to the Threshold
Amount, Executive shall be entitled to the full benefits payable under this
Agreement.

 

(ii) If the Threshold Amount is less than (A) the Severance Payments, but
greater than (B) the Severance Payments reduced by the sum of (1) the Excise
Tax and (2) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment
taxes on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in excess of the
Threshold Amount, then the benefits payable under this Agreement shall be
reduced (but not below zero) to the extent necessary so that the sum of all
Severance Payments shall not exceed the Threshold Amount.

 

(b) For the purposes of this Section 6, "Threshold Amount" shall mean three
times Executives "base amount" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder less one dollar ($1.00);
and "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code, and any interest or penalties incurred by Executive with respect to
such excise tax.



 

3 (c) The determination as to which of the alternative provisions of Section
6(a) shall apply to Executive shall be made by a nationally recognized
accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall
provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the
Executive within 15 business days of the Termination Date, if applicable, or
at such earlier time as is reasonably requested by the Company or Executive.
For purposes of determining which of the alternative provisions of Section
6(a) shall apply, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals
for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, and state and
local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of individual taxation in
the state and locality of the Executives residence on the Date of
Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. Any determination
by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive.

7\. _Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Covenants_.

(a) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Section 7, the following terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

(i) " _Business_ " shall mean the business of the Company, the Parent and all

employment.

 

(ii) " _Competitive Business_ " shall mean any business that recruits and

limitation, business, financial and marketing plans and projections.

(iv) " _Non-Competition Period_ " shall mean the greater of (i) the eighteen
month period following the date of the termination of Executives employment,
for any reason other than a Change In Control and regardless of whether
Executive is entitled to any Severance Benefits, or (ii) in the event
a termination without "Cause" occurs within one year after a "Change in
Control, the (2) year period following the date of the termination of
Executives employment.

 

(v) " _Person_ " shall mean an individual, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, association, trust or other entity or organization

resources.



 

4 The parties acknowledge that references to the Company in this Section 7 shall
be deemed be references to the Company and its subsidiaries.

(b) _Consideration_. The Executive acknowledges that the provisions of
this Section 7 are in consideration of (i) employment with the Company; (ii)
the Companys agreement to pay severance benefits as set forth in Section
2; (iii) Executives access to the Companys Confidential Information and
Trade Secrets, (iv) Executives access to specialized training and knowledge
pertaining to products, services, business practices and procedures developed
and/or used by the Company; (v) access to Company relationships, and (vi)
additional good and valuable consideration as set forth in this Agreement.

stated above is sufficient, individually, to support the covenants set forth
in this Section 7\. Executive also hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (a)
Executive will simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement and will
frequently be exposed to certain Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
during his Employment; (b) Executives responsibilities on behalf of the
Company may extend to all geographical areas of the Restricted Territory; and
(c) any competitive activity on Executives part from the date hereof until
the Termination Date, or any competitive activity on Executives part in the
Restricted Territory for a reasonable period thereafter, would necessarily
involve Executives use of the Companys Trade Secrets and Confidential
Information and would unfairly threaten the Companys legitimate business
interests, including its substantial investment in the proprietary aspects of
its business and its associated goodwill. Moreover, Executive acknowledges
that, in the event of the termination of this Agreement, Executive would have
sufficient skills to find alternative, commensurate work in his field of
expertise that would not involve a violation of any of the provisions of this
Section 7\. Therefore, Executive acknowledges and agrees that it is reasonable
for the Company to require Executive to abide by the covenants set forth in
this Section 7\.

 

(c) _Ownership of Proprietary Property_. To the greatest extent possible,

the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.A. § 101 _et seq_., as amended) and owned
exclusively by the Company. Executive hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
transfers and assigns to the Company all rights, title and interest Executive
currently has or in the future may have, by operation of law or otherwise, in
or to any Work Product, including, without limitation, all patents,
copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights.
Executive agrees to execute and deliver to the Company any transfers,
assignments, documents or other instruments which the Company may deem
necessary or appropriate to vest complete title and ownership of any
Work Product, and all rights therein, exclusively in the Company.

(d)  _Non-Competition_. Executive covenants and agrees that during the

of a corporation (engaged in a Competitive Business) whose shares are listed
on a national stock exchange or traded in the NASDAQ over-the-counter market.

 

(e) _Non-Solicitation of Customers and Suppliers_. During the Non-
Competition Period, Executive shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent, (a) solicit, raid, entice, induce or contact any Person that is a
Customer (as hereinafter defined) of the Company to become a customer or a
client of any Competitive Business; or (b) solicit, entice, divert,

prior to the Termination Date, committed verbally or in writing to using the
services of the Company.

 

(f) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. During the Non-Competition Period,
Executive shall not, without the Companys prior written consent, (a)
solicit, recruit, hire or attempt to solicit, recruit or hire away any

 



 

5  employee, current, former or prospective contract healthcare professional,
consultant, contractor or other personnel of the Company or solicit or induce
any such Person to termination or otherwise diminish in any respect his, her
or its relationship with the Company; or (b) employ, engage or seek to employ
or engage any Person who within the twelve (12) months prior to the
Termination Date had been an employee of the Company provided, however, that
this provision does not preclude Executive from accepting a position in
organization that does not otherwise violate any provision of this Agreement,
on the grounds that the organization employs a Person who previously worked
for the Company. For purposes of this Section 7(g), a Person shall be deemed
to have been a "prospective" contract healthcare professional, consultant,
contractor or other personnel of the Company if the Company shall have had
prior contact with such Person but shall not have hired, retained or engaged
such Person.

(g)  _Non-Disclosure_.

(i) Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, as to Confidential Information
and Trade Secrets, at all times during the Non-Competition Period, and
thereafter for such time as the same shall remain confidential (except if such
information is no longer confidential due to Executives breach of this
Agreement), Executive will not, other than in connection with his provision
of services to the Company hereunder, either directly or indirectly, use,
distribute, sell, license, transfer, assign, disclose, disseminate, copy,
appropriate or otherwise communicate any Trade Secrets or Confidential
Information to any Person nor shall Executive make use of any such Trade
Secrets or Confidential Information for his own purposes in a Competitive
Business or otherwise or for the benefit of any other Person engaged
in Competitive Business.

(ii) Executive shall cooperate fully with the Company in the procurement of
any protection of the Companys right to or in any of the Trade Secrets or
Confidential Information; provided, however, any out of pocket costs
associated with such procurement or protection shall be borne by the Company.

 

(iii) Immediately on the Termination Date, or at any time before the
Termination Date upon the specific request of the Company, Executive shall
return to the Company all written or descriptive materials of any kind in
Executives possession or to which Executive has access that constitute or
contain any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, and
the confidentiality obligations described in this Agreement shall continue
until their expiration under the terms of this Agreement.

 

(h) _Goodwill_. During the Non-Competition Period, Executive shall not (i)
make any statement or other communication that impugns or attacks the
reputation or character of the Company, or (ii) take any action that would
interfere with any Customer or other relationships of the Company.

 

(i) _Additional Acknowledgments of Executive_. Executive acknowledges that
a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 7 will cause
irreparable damage to AMN, the exact amount of which will be difficult to
ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach will be
inadequate. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if Executive breaches or
threatens to breach any covenant contained in this Section 7, in addition to
any other remedy that may be available at law or in equity, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief and Executive
hereby waives any defense that the Company would have an adequate remedy at
law. In the event any covenant or agreement in this Section 7 shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by
reason of its extending for too great a period of time or over to great a
geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other
respect, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of
time for which it may be enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical
area as to which it may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all
other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such
court in such action.

 

(j) _Survival_. Notwithstanding any expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7 shall survive and remain in full
force and effect until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period and any
other provision hereof that, by its terms or reasonable interpretation
thereof, sets forth obligations that extend beyond the termination of this
Agreement.



 

6 8\. _Term of Agreement for Severance Benefits_

 

The provisions of the Agreement relating to Executives entitlement to
Severance Benefits as described herein apply only to Executives employment
by the Company in an officer position with profit and loss responsibility,
collectively, for the Companys vendor management services, per diem and home
health service offerings. In the event Executive is offered and accepts a
change in position (employment with the Company in a position other than an
executive position with commensurate responsibilities as those stated above),
Executives entitlement to Severance Benefits hereunder and the provisions
of this Agreement related thereto, automatically terminate. The parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that the provisions set forth in Paragraph 1
above relating to Executives at will employment and Paragraph 7 relating to
Executives Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Covenants
remain in full force and effect as long as Executive remains employed by the
Company in any position, unless expressly revoked and /or amended by written
agreement.

 

9\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

 

(a) This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and may be amended, modified or changed
only by a written instrument executed by Executive and the Company. No
provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a writing executed and
delivered by the party sought to be charged. Executive acknowledges that this
Agreement replaces any prior severance agreement entered into by and between
the Company and Executive.

 

(b) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Texas, without reference to principles of conflict of
laws.

(c) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing; shall

any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in

2 American Stock Transfer and Trust Company

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned hereby surrenders to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), the certificates (or, with respect to Preferred
Options and Preferred Warrants, the Surrender Agreement) (the "
_Certificates_ ") listed above in Box 1 (Description of Certificate(s)
Surrendered) formerly representing outstanding shares, options and warrants of
some or all of the following: (i) shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Series A Preferred Stock_ "),
of NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), (ii) shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ("
_Series B Preferred Stock_ "), of the Company, (iii) shares of Series C
Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company ("
_Series C Preferred Stock_" and together with the Series A Preferred Stock
and the Series B Preferred Stock, the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), (iv)
options to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock (" _Preferred Options_
") and (v) warrants to purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock ("
_Preferred Warrants_ " and together with the Company Preferred Stock and the
Preferred Options, the " _Company Securities_ "). It is understood that this
Letter of Transmittal is subject to (i) the terms and conditions of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 28, 2010 (as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and
among AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _AMN_ "),
Nightingale Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of AMN (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company and the other parties
thereto, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the undersigned and (ii)
the accompanying Instructions. At the request of the undersigned, AMN agrees
to provide to the undersigned a conformed copy of the executed Merger
Agreement and all exhibits thereto.

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, each share of Company Securities was converted in the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
remaining as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), into
the right to receive that portion of the merger consideration (as set forth
in Article III of the Merger Agreement) allocated to such share of Company
Securities in accordance with Article III of the Merger Agreement, without
interest and subject to any required withholding taxes;  _provided_ , that in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), a portion of the merger consideration will
be deposited into escrow (the " _Escrowed Merger Consideration_ "), and the
Escrowed Merger Consideration will be released and delivered by the escrow
agent thereunder to the undersigned only in such amounts, if any, and at such
times, if at all, as provided for in the Merger Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The undersigned hereby irrevocably surrenders to the Exchange Agent
the Certificates for cancellation by AMN in exchange for the allocable portion
of the merger consideration in respect of each share of Company
Securities formerly represented by the Certificates, subject to the escrowed
holdback of a portion of such merger consideration as described above.

 

The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional
documents reasonably deemed by AMN to be necessary or desirable to complete
the exchange of the Certificates for the portion of the merger consideration
in respect of each share of Company Securities formerly represented by the
Certificates. The undersigned consents to AMN, the Surviving Corporation, any
of its successors or assigns and/or their respective board of directors (or
other corporate governance body) taking any corrective action necessary to
ensure that the Merger Agreement and related transactions and all actions
heretofore taken by the Company are properly approved by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any of their respective successors or assigns, their
respective boards of directors (or other corporate governance body) and
stockholders.

 

By delivering any Certificate, the undersigned hereby releases, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, the Company, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation and AMN, and their respective affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, partners, members, agents, advisors and representatives,
and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Releasees_
"), from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits, damages,
judgments, expenses, demands and other obligations or

 



 

3  liabilities whatsoever, in law or in equity, arising out of, in connection
with or by reason of, the purchase or ownership of the shares of Company
Securities held by the undersigned, the delivery of the Certificates hereby,
the sale of such Company Securities pursuant to the Merger Agreement or the
cancellation of the Certificates in exchange for the right to receive the
portion of the merger consideration allocated to the shares represented by
such Certificates, including, but not limited to, the allocation of the merger
consideration among the shares of Company Securities as described in Article
III of the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Released Matters_ ");
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not release the Releasees from (i) their
obligation to deliver the allocable portion of the merger consideration in
respect of each share of Company Securities formerly represented by the
Certificate in exchange therefor in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (less the allocable portion of the Escrowed
Merger Consideration), (ii) their obligation to deliver the Escrowed
Merger Consideration to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement or (iii)
any other right, obligation or liability any Releasee shall have to the
undersigned not related to the Released Matters, including with respect to the
undersigned being an officer, director, employee, agent, consultant or
advisor to any Releasee.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned is the
sole record, legal and beneficial owner of the shares of Company Securities
represented by the surrendered certificate(s) and has full power and authority
to surrender the Certificates formerly representing outstanding shares of
Company Securities and that, upon the delivery thereof to AMN, as the
Surviving Corporations agent for cancellation pursuant hereto, the Surviving
Corporation will acquire good and unencumbered title thereto, free and clear
of all liens, restrictions, charges, encumbrances and adverse claims.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned (select
one):

 is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "); or 

 

 has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the AMN Securities (as defined below) and of making an informed investment decision with respect thereto. 

 

The undersigned hereby:

 

(i) represents and warrants that it is aware that the issuance of the shares
of (a) common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AMN (the " _AMN Common
Stock_ "), (b) Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of AMN (the " _AMN Preferred Stock_ "), and (c) AMN Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of AMN Preferred Stock (together
with the AMN Common Stock and the AMN Preferred Stock, the " _AMN Securities_
") to it is being made in reliance on a private placement exemption from
registration under the Securities Act;

(ii) represents and warrants that it is receiving the AMN Securities, in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, for investment and not with a view
toward, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any
present intention of distributing or selling such AMN Securities;

 

(iii) acknowledges and agrees that the AMN Securities are being offered in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act, that the AMN Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act and that the AMN Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or
otherwise transferred only (a) in a transaction not involving a public
offering; (b) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act provided by Rule 144 thereunder (if available); (c) pursuant to any
effective registration statement under the Securities act; or (d) to AMN
or one of its subsidiaries, in each of cases (a) through (d) in accordance
with any applicable securities laws of any State of the United States;

 

(iv) represents and warrants that it is able to bear the economic risk of
holding the AMN Securities (including the risk of a complete loss of such
investment in the AMN Securities) for an indefinite period;



 

4 (v) represents and warrants that it has such knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters and is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the investment in the AMN Securities and of making an informed
investment decision with respect thereto;

 

(vi) represents and warrants that it (a) has had access to all the materials
relating to AMN and the AMN Securities required to be furnished under Rule
502(b)(2) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and (b) has been offered
the opportunity to conduct such review and analysis of the business, assets,
condition, operations and prospects of AMN and its subsidiaries and to ask
questions of AMN and its subsidiaries and received answers thereto, each as it
deemed necessary in connection with the decision to make the investment in the
AMN Securities;

 

(vii) represents and warrants that neither AMN nor any of its affiliates has
rendered or will render any investment advice, tax advice or securities
valuation advice to the undersigned, and that the undersigned is neither
subscribing for nor acquiring the AMN Securities in reliance upon, or with the
expectation of, any such advice;

 

(viii) represents and warrants that it is not acquiring the AMN Securities as
a result of or subsequent to any advertisement, article, notice or other
communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over television or radio, any seminar or meeting, or any
solicitation in connection with investments in securities generally; 

(ix) acknowledges and agrees that, unless sold pursuant to a registration
statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act or in
compliance with Rule 144 thereunder, AMN may require the implementation of
appropriate restrictions on the transfer of AMN Securities substantially to
give effect to the following:

 

"THIS SECURITY WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION NOT INVOLVING ANY PUBLIC
OFFERING WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT AND THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION
THEREFROM. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF AMN
HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC. THAT (A) THIS SECURITY MAY BE OFFERED, RESOLD,
PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ONLY (I) IN A TRANSACTION NOT INVOLVING
A PUBLIC OFFERING, (II) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE), (III) PURSUANT
TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (IV) TO AMN
HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC. OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN EACH OF CASES (I)
THROUGH (IV) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF
THE UNITED STATES, AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL NOTIFY ANY SUBSEQUENT PURCHASER OF
THIS SECURITY FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO IN (A) ABOVE;"
and

(x) understands and agrees that AMN will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
the representations, warranties and acknowledgements contained in this Letter
of Transmittal.

 

The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Exchange Agent
the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with
respect to the Certificates, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution (and such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable
power coupled with an interest) to deliver the Certificates, together with
all accompanying evidence of transfer and authenticity, to the Surviving
Corporation for cancellation upon receipt by the Exchange Agent, as the
undersigneds agent, of the portion of the merger consideration in respect of
each share of Company Securities formerly represented by the Certificates.
All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of
Transmittal and every obligation of the

 



 

5  undersigned hereunder will be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs,
executors, administrators, trustees in bankruptcy and legal representatives of
the undersigned (collectively, " _Successors-in-Interest_ ") and will not be
affected by, and will survive, the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of the
undersigned.

 

The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal in exchange for the
portion of the merger consideration in respect of each share of Company
Securities formerly represented by the Certificates (subject to the escrowed
holdback of a portion of such merger consideration as Escrowed Merger
Consideration as described above) will not be deemed to have occurred unless
and until the Exchange Agent has received the Certificates and this Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with all
accompanying evidence of authority in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation (which may delegate such power in
whole or in part to AMN), (ii) delivery of such Certificates will be effected
and risk of loss and title to such Certificates will pass only upon proper
surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent and (iii) all questions as to the
validity, form and eligibility of this Letter of Transmittal, any other
documentation delivered herewith or pursuant hereto, and any purported
surrender of Certificates hereunder will be determined in good faith by the
Surviving Corporation (which may delegate such power in whole or in part to
AMN), which determination will be final and binding on all parties.

 

The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints GSUIG, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Representative_ "), the true and
lawful agents and attorneys-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to the
Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, dated as of the closing date of the
Merger (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), by and among the escrow agent thereunder
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the Representative and AMN, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, with full power of substitution and resubstitution (and
such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with
an interest) to act on behalf of the undersigned in any litigation or
arbitration involving the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. All
authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal
and every obligation of the undersigned hereunder will be binding upon his,
her or its Successors-in-Interest and will not be affected by, and will
survive, the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of the undersigned.
The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that AMN, the Surviving Corporation,
the Escrow Agent and any other person may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any action of the Representative, as the action of the
undersigned in all matters referred to in the Merger Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. The undersigned agrees that the Representatives shall have full
power and authority to represent the undersigned, with respect to all matters
arising under the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and all actions
taken by the Representative thereunder shall be binding upon the undersigned,
as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by the undersigned. The
Escrow Agent, AMN and the Surviving Corporation may rely on the
Representative as the undersigneds exclusive agent and shall incur no
liability to any party with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in
reliance thereon.

 

The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for fraud,
criminal activity, gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the Representatives part, the Representative shall have no liability to the
undersigned under the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or this Letter of
Transmittal for any act or omission by the Representative on behalf of the
undersigned. 

The undersigned hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees with AMN and the
Surviving Corporation that, by executing and delivering this Letter of
Transmittal, (i) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including,
without limitation, the indemnification obligations and procedures set forth
in Article XI of the Merger Agreement, and Sections 7.3 and 7.4 of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, shall be
binding on the undersigned and his, her or its Successors-in-Interest to the
same extent as if the undersigned were a party to the Merger Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the
Merger, the undersigned has ceased to have any rights with respect to or
arising from the shares of Company Securities formerly represented by the
Certificates, except the right to receive the portion of the merger
consideration upon the surrender of such 



 

6  Certificates pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal in accordance with, in
the amounts of and at the times specified in, the Merger Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

 

Unless otherwise indicated below under Box 3 ("Special Issuance Instructions")

within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code (including,
among others, a U.S. resident alien) generally is required to provide the
Company and any other payor of Merger Consideration with a correct taxpayer
identification number (" _TIN_ ") on Substitute Form W-9, which is provided
under "Important Tax Information" in _Schedule B_ to this Letter of
Transmittal, and to certify that the surrendering stockholder (and, if
applicable, such other person) is not subject to backup withholding. If a
surrendering stockholder or such other person has been notified by the United
States Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") that such person is subject
to backup withholding, such person must cross out item (2) of the
Certification box of the Substitute Form W-9, unless such person has since
been notified by the IRS that such person is no longer subject to backup
withholding. Failure to provide the information on the Substitute Form W-9 may
subject the surrendering stockholder (and, if applicable, the other person
designated in Box 3 above to be issued any shares of AMN Preferred Stock or
AMN Common Stock in book-entry form) to backup withholding at the then-
applicable rate (which as of the date hereof is 28%) on any payments made in
respect of surrendered Certificates. The phrase "Applied for" may be written
in Part I of the Substitute Form W-9 if the surrendering stockholder or other
person designated in Box 3 above has not been issued a TIN and has applied for
a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If "Applied for" is
written in Part I, (i) the Company or other payor may subject payments made in
respect of surrendered Certificates to backup withholding and (ii) if a TIN is
not provided within 60 days, the Company or such other payor may subject the
stockholder to backup withholding on payments made until a TIN is provided.

(7) _Stock Transfer Taxes_. If issuance of shares of AMN Preferred Stock
or AMN Common Stock in book-entry form in respect of surrendered Certificates
are to be made to any person(s) other than the registered holder(s) of such
Certificates, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s) or such other person(s)) payable on account of such
transfer will be deducted from the consideration payable in exchange for the
surrendered Certificates unless satisfactory evidence of payment of such
taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted. Except as provided in this
Instruction 7, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed
to the Certificates surrendered herewith, or for funds to cover such stamps
to be provided with this Letter of Transmittal.

(8) _Mutilated, Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._ If any
certificate representing shares of Company Securities has been mutilated,
lost, stolen or destroyed, the former stockholder of the Company should
promptly complete the Affidavit Regarding Certificate attached to this Letter

documents cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing mutilated,
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates have been followed. 

(9) _Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies_. All questions relating
to procedures for surrendering Certificates, as well as requests for
assistance or additional copies of this Letter of Transmittal, should be
directed to the Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the first page of
this Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

11 IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

United States federal tax law generally requires that a stockholder that is a
U.S. person within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code
(including, among others, a U.S. resident alien) surrendering Certificates
provide the Company and any other payor of Merger Consideration with such
stockholders correct TIN on Substitute Form W-9, which, in the case of
a surrendering stockholder who is an individual, is his or her social
security number. If a stockholder does not provide the correct TIN or if any
other information is not correctly provided, such stockholder may be subject
to a penalty of up to $500 imposed by the IRS. In addition, such stockholder
may be subject to backup withholding at the then-applicable rate (which as of
the date hereof is 28%) on any payments received in respect of surrendered
Certificates.

 

Certain persons are not subject to backup withholding. An exempt stockholder,
other than a non-U.S. person, should enter the stockholders name, address,
status and TIN on the face of the Substitute Form W-9, check the "Exempt" box
in Part II of the Substitute Form W-9, and sign, date and return the
Substitute Form W-9. See the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of
Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 (the " _W-9 Guidelines_
") for additional instructions.

 

A surrendering stockholder that is not a U.S. person within the meaning of the
United States Internal Revenue Code (a " _non-U.S. stockholder_ ") should not
complete the Substitute Form W-9. A non-U.S. stockholder instead should obtain
the applicable IRS Form W-8 from the Exchange Agent or from the IRS website at
www.irs.gov. The non-U.S. stockholder should then complete, sign and return
the appropriate IRS Form W-8 in accordance with the instructions to such form
in order to avoid any applicable withholding taxes. Non-U.S. stockholders
should consult with their tax advisors regarding any questions they may have
with respect to the completion of the appropriate IRS Form W-8.

If backup withholding applies, AMN or such other payor, as applicable,
generally is required to withhold at the then-applicable rate on any
consideration to be received by a payee. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the United States federal income tax liability of
persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of such
withholding provided the required information is furnished to the IRS. If
backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to
the IRS.

To prevent backup withholding, each surrendering stockholder (other than
an exempt or non-U.S. stockholder subject to the requirements set forth
above) should provide such stockholders correct TIN by completing the
"Substitute Form W-9" set forth below, certifying that (i) the TIN provided is
correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN) and (ii) the stockholder
is not subject to backup withholding because (a) the stockholder is exempt
from backup withholding, (b) the stockholder has not been notified by the IRS
that such stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of a
failure to report all interest or dividends or (c) the IRS has notified the
stockholder that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding
and (iii) the stockholder is a U.S. person.

The surrendering stockholder (other than an exempt or non-U.S. stockholder
subject to the requirements set forth above) is required to give the TIN
(e.g., the social security number or employer identification number) of the
record holder of the Certificates. If the Certificates are in more than one
name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the W-9 Guidelines
for information on which TIN to report. If the stockholder has not been issued
a TIN and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the
near future, the stockholder may return a properly completed, signed
Substitute Form W-9 with "Applied for" written in Part I. If "Applied for" is
written in Part I, the stockholder must also complete the Certificate of
Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number in order to avoid backup withholding.
If "Applied for" is written in Part I, (i) AMN or other payor may subject the
consideration payable in respect of surrendered Certificates to backup
withholding and (ii) if a TIN is not provided within sixty (60) days, backup
withholding may begin with respect to the consideration payable and continue
until the stockholder furnishes its TIN.

 

For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger will be considered
to occur in the taxable period during which the Merger is effective,
regardless of whether the surrendering stockholder surrenders Certificates in
that taxable period.

furnish a taxpayer identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may
also apply.

Penalties

to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are subject to
a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to

make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.

AMN Healthcare to Acquire Medfinders

 

Expands Nations Largest Healthcare Staffing and Workforce Solutions Company

 

Increases Growing Clinical Workforce Managed Services Capability

 

SAN DIEGO, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.
(NYSE: AHS), the nations largest healthcare staffing and workforce solutions
company, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the parent company of
Arlington, Texas-based Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), one of the
nations leading providers of clinical workforce managed services
programs. Through its multi-brand strategy, Medfinders also provides travel
nurse and allied staffing, locum tenens, physician search services, and home
healthcare services, as well as local nurse and allied staffing in support of
its managed services programs.

"Bringing together the experience and diverse capabilities of both companies
in healthcare staffing and managed services will create significant short and
long-term benefits for our clients," said Susan Nowakowski, President and CEO
of AMN Healthcare. "The expansion of our service lines resulting from this
combination will substantially improve our ability to deliver an innovative,
total workforce management and staffing solution to our broad and growing
client base. This is a strategic opportunity for two leaders in healthcare
staffing to come together to achieve additional sales and
operating efficiencies while immediately enhancing and expanding our service
offerings."

"This is an ideal combination for our clients, healthcare professionals, and
team members," said Bob Livonius, CEO of Medfinders. "As an integrated and
increasingly diverse company, we will be even more effective and efficient in
delivering high quality and innovative workforce management solutions to our
clients across the full spectrum of clinical specialties and services."

Under the terms of the agreement, AMN will acquire all of the outstanding
equity of Medfinders parent company for approximately 6.3 million shares of
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. common stock, and approximately 5.7 million
shares of AMN Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock with a
liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and a dividend rate of 11% per
annum. Initially, the preferred stock will be non-voting and will not be
convertible into shares of AMN common stock. Following the closing of the
transaction, AMN shareholders will be asked to approve at a shareholders
meeting the voting rights of the preferred stock and the convertibility on a
one-for-one basis. AMN expects to file a proxy statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission following the closing. If AMNs
shareholders approve the conversion and the voting features of the preferred
stock within 180 days of the closing of the transaction, the preferred stock
shall cease to accrue dividends and any accrued dividends will be forgiven.

In connection with the transaction, AMN Healthcare is expected to refinance
its existing Term B facility of approximately $107 million and pay off
Medfinders existing debt facilities totaling approximately $132 million. AMN
Healthcare expects to amend and extend its current Term B loan and increase
its balance by an estimated $68 million to $175 million and issue a second
lien term loan of $50 million. In addition, AMN Healthcare expects to amend
and extend its existing revolving credit facility, which is expected to be
undrawn at closing.

 

Valuing all of the equity securities to be issued in the transaction using AMN
Healthcares closing share price on the day immediately preceding
the execution of the definitive agreement, and assuming conversion of the
preferred securities to be issued by AMN Healthcare, the transaction has a
value of approximately $220 million (including approximately $132 million of
Medfinders indebtedness to be refinanced). Upon consummation of the
transaction, former Medfinders shareholders will own approximately 26% of AMN
Healthcare Services, Inc. (on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis). The
transaction, which is expected to be accretive to full year earnings in 2011,
is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010, and is subject to customary
closing conditions, regulatory approvals and receipt of debt financing. "Our clients are seeking new, more sophisticated, value-added workforce
solutions, and they desire a partner who can deliver a broad suite of
offerings with their changing needs," noted Ms. Nowakowski. "The combined
capabilities of AMN Healthcare and Medfinders will provide immediate benefit
to our clients and position us to be a more capable, innovative partner.

"Expanding into home healthcare also represents an opportunity to capitalize
on future growth in a fragmented industry that we anticipate, similar to our
core staffing businesses, will be fueled by the long-term dynamics of an aging
population. This acquisition advances our long-term strategy of leveraging our
core competencies, operational infrastructure, and extensive network of
clinicians seeking career opportunities at a local and national level. We
believe the value, breadth and depth of services we can offer to our clients
will be unparalleled within the industry."

dissolution or winding up of the Company or Change of Control, as applicable
(whether or not such holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been
eligible to convert its shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date). To
the extent such amount is paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred
Stock and all the holders of Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock of the
Company shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company (or
proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences.

 

(b) _Partial Payment_. If, in connection with any distribution described in
Section 5(a) above, the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof are not
sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preferences in full to all holders of Series
A Preferred Stock and all holders of Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other
Parity Stock shall be paid _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective
aggregate Liquidation Preferences of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and the holders of all such other Parity Stock. 

Section 6\. _Conversion_.

 

(a) _Conversion at Option of Holders_. At any time after the receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted
on any date, from time to time, at the option of the holder thereof, into the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number obtained by _dividing_
(x) the sum of (A) the Liquidation Preference _plus_ (B) except to the extent
paid in cash as contemplated by Section 6(c) at the time of the conversion, an
amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the accrued but unpaid
dividends to which such holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4(b) through, but excluding, the
conversion date, if any, _by_ (y) the Conversion Rate in effect at such time.
The right of conversion attaching to any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
may be exercised by the holders thereof by delivering the shares to be
converted to the office of the Company, accompanied by a duly signed and
completed notice of conversion in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company. The conversion date shall be the date on which the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and the duly signed and completed notice of conversion are
received by the Company. The Person entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such Common Stock as of such conversion date, and such
Person or Persons shall cease to be a record holder of the Series A
Preferred Stock on that date. As promptly as practicable on or after the
conversion date (and in any event no later than five Trading Days thereafter),
the Company shall issue the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion. Any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be delivered by the Company to the
appropriate holder on a book-entry basis.

 

(b) _Mandatory Conversion_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
automatically converted, immediately at the Close of Business on the
Mandatory Conversion Date, with no further action required to be taken by the
Company or the holder thereof, into the number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the number obtained by _dividing _ (x) the sum of (A) the Liquidation
Preference _plus_ (B) except to the extent paid in cash as contemplated by
Section 6(c) at the time of the conversion, an amount per share of Series A
Preferred Stock equal to the accrued but unpaid dividends to which such
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 4(b) through, but excluding, the conversion date, if any, _by_ (y)
the Conversion Rate in effect at such time. Immediately upon conversion as
provided herein (i) each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such
holders shares of Series A Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the share
register of the Company shall then be closed or that book-entry evidence shall
not then actually be delivered to such Person and (ii) each converted shares
of Series A Preferred Stock as provided herein shall be retired and cancelled
automatically with no further action required to be taken by the Company or
the holder thereof. As promptly as practicable on or after the Mandatory
Conversion Date (and in any event no later than five Trading
Days thereafter), the Company shall provide notice to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date,
which notice shall set forth procedures for the surrender of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock which have been converted to the



 

6  office of the Company. The Company shall promptly issue the number of whole
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion against the surrender of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Any shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be delivered by the
Company to the appropriate holder on a book-entry basis.

 

(c) _Option to Pay Accrued Dividends in Cash_. When shares of Series A
Preferred Stock are converted pursuant to this Section 6, all dividends
accrued but not yet paid on the Series A Preferred Stock so converted from and
including the Original Issue Date to and including the date of conversion may,
at the election of the Company, be paid, in whole or in part, in cash; it
being understood that the amount of any accrued dividend so paid in cash shall
reduce the amount added to the Liquidation Preference pursuant to clause (B)
of Section 6(a) and clause B of Section 6(b).

(d) _Common Stock Reserved for Issuance_. The Company shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock,
solely for issuance upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such
number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon
the conversion of all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding. Any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be (i) duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid
and nonassessable and (ii) shall rank _pari passu_ with the other shares of
Common Stock outstanding from time to time.

 

(e) _Taxes_. The Company shall pay any and all transfer taxes that may be
payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. The Company shall not, however, be
required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered,
and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person
requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or
has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been
paid.

(f) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock but, in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable in
respect of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock so
converted at one time by the same holder, the Company shall pay in cash an
amount equal to the product of (i) the Closing Price of a share of Common
Stock on the last Trading Day before (x) the Mandatory Conversion Date in the
case of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 6(b) or (y) the date of
delivery of a notice of conversion to the Company pursuant to Section 6(a) and
(ii) such fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

Section 7\. _Conversion Rate Adjustments_. The Conversion Rate shall be
adjusted from time to time (successively and for each event described) by the
Company as follows:

 

(a) In the event that the Company shall at any time or from time to time after
the Original Issue Date (i) pay a dividend or make a distribution (other than
a dividend or distribution paid or made to holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock in the manner provided in Section 4(a)) on the outstanding
shares of Common Stock in capital stock (which, for purposes of this Section
7 shall include, without limitation, any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire Capital Stock) of the Company, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, (iv) issue any shares
of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock or (v) pay a
dividend or make a distribution (other than a dividend or distribution paid
or made to holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the manner
provided in Section 4(a)) on the outstanding shares of Common Stock in
securities of the Company pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison
pill" or similar arrangement, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Rate
in effect immediately prior to such event shall be increased or decreased, as
applicable, (and any other appropriate actions shall be taken by the Company)
so that the holder of any share of Series A Preferred Stock thereafter
surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares
of Common Stock or other securities of the Company that such holder would have
owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of



 

7  any of the events described above, had such share of Series A Preferred
Stock been converted immediately prior to the occurrence of such event
(whether or not such holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been
eligible to convert its shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date). An
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective
retroactively (i) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, to a date
immediately following the Close of Business on the Record Date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution or (ii) in the case of any such subdivision, combination
or reclassification, to the Close of Business on the day upon which such
corporate action becomes effective.

(b) In the event that the Company shall, at any time or from time to time
after the Original Issue Date distribute to all holders of shares of its
Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a
consolidation or merger in which the Company is the resulting or surviving
corporation and the Common Stock is not changed or exchanged) cash, evidences
of indebtedness of the Company or another issuer, securities of the Company or
another issuer or other assets (excluding (i) dividends or distributions paid
or made to holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the manner
provided in Section 4(a), and (ii) dividends payable in shares of Common Stock
(or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Common Stock) for which
adjustment is made under Section 7(a)) or rights or warrants to subscribe for
or purchase securities of the Company (excluding those in respect of which an
adjustment in the Conversion Rate is made pursuant to Section 7(a)), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Rate then in effect shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of
such distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the
Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date referred to below less
the then fair market value of the portion of the cash, evidences of
indebtedness, securities or other assets so distributed or of such
subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock (but
such numerator not to be less than zero) and (y) the denominator of which
shall be the Closing Price of the Common Stock on such Record Date. Such
adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall
become effective retroactively to a date immediately following the Close of
Business on the Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive such distribution.

 

(c) In the event that the Company, at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date, shall take any action affecting its Common Stock similar
to or having an effect similar to any of the actions described in Section 7(a)
or Section 7(b) (but not including any action described in any such Section
and without any duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to such
Sections) and the Board of Directors in good faith determines that it would be
equitable in the circumstances to adjust the Conversion Rate as a result of
such action, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall
be increased or decreased, as applicable, in such manner and at such time as
the Board of Directors in good faith determines would be equitable in the
circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in a resolution, a certified
copy of which shall be sent to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this
Section 7 need be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would
require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate then in
effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at
the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, which, together
with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an
increase or decrease of at least 1% of such Conversion Rate. Any adjustment to
the Conversion Rate carried forward and not theretofore made shall be made
immediately prior to the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
pursuant to Sections 6(a) and (b).

 

Section 8\. _Redemption_.

 

(a) _Optional Redemption_. In the event the Stockholder Approval has not
been obtained by the tenth anniversary of the Original Issue Date, the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time
on or after the tenth anniversary of the Original Issue Date, at the option of
the Company out of funds lawfully available therefor upon giving notice of
redemption pursuant to Section 8(b), at a redemption price per share of Series
A Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (x) the sum of (a) the Liquidation
Preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock _plus_ (b) an amount per
share of Series A



 

8  Preferred Stock equal to the declared but unpaid dividends to which such
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 4(a), if any, _plus_  (c) an amount per share of Series A
Preferred Stock equal to the accrued but unpaid dividends to which such holder
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 4(b) to but excluding the date fixed for such redemption, if any, and
(y) the product of (a) the Market Price per share of Common Stock and (b) the
number of shares of Common Stock that such holder of Series A Preferred Stock
would have been entitled to receive had it converted each such share of
Series A Preferred Stock (whether or not such holder of Series A Preferred
Stock had been eligible to convert its shares of Series A Preferred Stock on
such redemption date). For purposes of this Section 8(a), "Market Price"
means the average Closing Price for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days
immediately preceding, but not including, the date as of which the Market
Price is to be determined.

 

(b) _Notice of Redemption at the Option of the Company_. Notice of every
redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8(a)
shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders
of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses
appearing on the books of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days
and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice
mailed as provided in this Section 8(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have
been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure
duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the
mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each notice
of redemption given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the
number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less
than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of
such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4)
the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered
for payment of the redemption price.

(c) _Partial Redemption_. In case of any redemption of part of the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed
shall be selected pro rata. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Company
shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon
which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.

(d) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If notice of redemption has been duly
given, then, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue
on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption
shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except
only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such
redemption without interest.

 

Section 9\. _Voting Rights; Information Rights_.

 

(a) Prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote, except as otherwise
provided herein or as otherwise required by applicable law. The holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any
stockholders meeting in accordance with the Bylaws.

 

(b) At any time and from time to time after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to vote as required by applicable law and with the holders of shares of Common
Stock, as a single class, on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders
of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein or as required by
applicable law. Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to the number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held of record
by such holder could then be converted pursuant to Section 6 at the Record
Date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such
matters or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is
taken or any written consent of stockholders is first executed.

(c) Notwithstanding whether or not the Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to notice of any stockholders meeting delivered to the

 



 

9  holders of Common Stock in accordance with the Bylaws and to otherwise
receive all other notices and information made available or delivered by the
Company to the holders of Common Stock. 

Section 10\. _Record Holders_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Company may deem and treat the record holder of any share
of Series A Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all
purposes, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 

Section 11\. _Notices_.

 

(a) _General_. All notices or communications in respect of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be given to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
in any manner permitted by the Depository Trust Company or any similar
facility through which the Series A Preferred Stock is issued in book-entry
form.

 

(b) _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall, to the extent not
included in the Exchange Act reports of the Company, provide reasonable
written notice to each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock of any event the
occurrence of which would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate,
including the then applicable Conversion Rate.

not have any rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers or relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the
Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law and regulation.
