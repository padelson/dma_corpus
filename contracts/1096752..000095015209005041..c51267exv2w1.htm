In the event that Buyer and Seller fail to agree on the allocation of the Final Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities within sixty (60) days of the Closing, all allocation matters in dispute shall be referred for final determination to an independent accounting firm of national standing (the " _Allocation Arbiter_ ") selected by Seller, and reasonably acceptable to Buyer, the expense of which shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after its acceptance of appointment, the Allocation Arbiter shall determine (based solely on presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review) 

    ##### 

  

    

only those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the
disputed matters and the resulting allocation of the Final Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities, which report shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties. Neither Buyer nor Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
unless required to do so by applicable law, shall take any position (whether
in financial statements, audits, tax returns or otherwise) which is
inconsistent with the final allocation determined by Buyer and Seller or, if
applicable, the determination of the Allocation Arbiter.

 (iii) Certain of the Assets may be in the possession of third parties (such as contract manufacturers or warehousemen) or in transit on the Closing Date.

 (ii) Buyer shall use from and after the date hereof commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate an offering (the " _Offering_ ") in order to fund the Base Purchase Price with cash. In the event that Buyer is unable to complete the Offering by June 1, 2009, Buyer shall have the option, exercisable upon written notice to Seller no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing, to pay the Base Purchase Price with Stock Consideration;  _provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may re-elect in its sole discretion to pay the Base Purchase Price in cash. 

  

 (iii) The " _Stock Consideration_ " shall be the number of shares of Buyer Preferred Stock calculated by dividing the Base Purchase Price by the Original Series A Issue Price of the Buyer Preferred Stock (as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the Buyer Preferred Stock). 

  

 (c) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (i) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (in its final and binding form, the " _Statement_ ") setting forth the Inventory Amount. In connection with the preparation of the Statement, Seller and Buyer shall jointly take and prepare a physical count of the Transferred Inventory which shall take into account any Inventory sold between the Effective Time and such physical count. 

   ##### 

  

    

During the thirty (30) days immediately following Buyers receipt of the
Statement, Buyer shall be permitted to review the final working papers
relating to the Statement. The Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer
unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement
so asserted; _provided_ , that no such Notice of Disagreement shall
be provided unless the aggregate amount of disagreements noticed is at least
$100,000. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the
Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall
become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the date the
parties hereto resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date any
matters properly in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Firm.
During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in
the Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Seller shall have full access
to the final working papers of Buyer prepared in connection with Buyers
preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30)-day
period, Seller and Buyer shall submit to Deloitte LLP (the " _Firm_ ") for
review and resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Firm
shall make a final determination of the Inventory Amount, which determination
shall be binding on the parties (it being understood, however, that the
Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations
by Buyer and Seller (and not by independent review), only those matters which
remain in dispute and which were properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement). The Statement shall become final and binding on Buyer and
Seller on the date the Firm delivers its final resolution to the parties
(which final resolution shall be delivered as soon as practicable following
the selection of the Firm). The Firm shall be selected by Seller and Buyer
or, if the parties are unable to agree, by Sellers and Buyers
independent accountants. The fees and expenses of the Firm pursuant to this
_Section 2(b)_ shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent
(50%) by Seller. 

  

 (ii) The Base Purchase Price shall be either increased by the amount by which the Inventory Amount exceeds Base Inventory Amount or decreased by the amount by which the Base Inventory Amount exceeds the Inventory Amount (the Base Purchase Price, as so increased or decreased, being referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). If the Base Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Base Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five (5) business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment to the other party by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of such difference. Such payment shall be in cash notwithstanding the form of consideration utilized for the Base Purchase Price paid at the Closing.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller, and the Ancillary Agreements shall be duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute, or will, when duly executed and delivered, constitute valid and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective 

   ##### 

  

    

terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be limited by

generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity) and except
that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive relief and other forms
of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought. 

  

 (ii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4(a)(ii)_, the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Seller with the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien, claim, encumbrance, security interest, option, charge or restriction of any kind upon any of the Assets under, or require any filing, consent, authorization, permit or approval under (A) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Seller, (B) any Contract or (C) any judgment, order or decree or any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Business or the Assets, other than (I) any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or liens, claims, encumbrances, security interests, options, charges or restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in damages, fines or penalties in excess of $1,000,000, (II) any such consents, authorizations or approvals required under the HSR Act or listed or described on _Schedule 3(a)(iii)_ or that may be required solely by reason of Buyers participation in the transactions contemplated hereby, or (III) the matters disclosed on _Schedule 4(e)_.

Seller has made available to Buyer access to true, complete and correct copies of each material Contract, and no such Contract has been modified or amended in any material respect, except as reflected on _Schedule 4(e)_. To the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute, a default under or a violation of any Contract or Purchase Order in any material respect by Seller or any other party to such Contract or Purchase Order or would cause the acceleration or termination of, or provide any party the right to accelerate or terminate, any material obligation of any party thereto or the creation of a Lien other than a Permitted Lien upon any Asset, or would require any consent thereunder.

(each of which is a recently acquired independent Subsidiary of Seller), as well as their respective controlled Affiliates so long as no such entity, individually or collectively with the other entities, derives more than $5,000,000 of net revenues (the " _Revenue Limit_ ") from the Restricted Business during any given fiscal year during the Restricted Period, B) perform their respective obligations under the Ancillary Agreements, and (C) purchase or otherwise become affiliated with any enterprise engaged in the Restricted Business so long as Seller uses reasonable efforts, as soon as reasonably practicable, to divest or cease to engage in all or part of such enterprises Restricted Business to the extent that such enterprise derived more than the Revenue Limit from the Restricted Business for its most recently completed fiscal year such that the Revenue Limit would not be exceeded after giving effect to such divestiture or cessation of all or part of the Restricted Business. For purposes hereof, the term " _consumer product_ " means any product purchased by the ultimate consumer for use in the home. The running of the Restricted Period shall be tolled during any period of time during which Seller is in breach of its obligations under this _Section 5(c)_, as determined by a final order of a court. 

  

 (ii) Seller agrees that during the Restricted Period, it shall not to use or disclose to any other Person except (x) as necessary under this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, or (y) as required by law, regulation, or court order, any trade secrets or confidential matters concerning the Business that are included in the Assets, including any Primary Intellectual Property or any Other Intellectual Property which Seller currently deems to be confidential (whether or not a trade secret under applicable law). 

  

 (iii) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions in this _Section 5(c)_ are reasonable and agrees that in the event of any breach thereof the harm to Buyer and the Business will be irreparable and without adequate remedy at law and therefore that injunctive relief with respect thereto would be appropriate. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines, in an action brought by or on behalf of Buyer, that any of the foregoing provisions are unenforceable as stated, the parties intend that such restrictions be modified to permit the maximum enforceable restriction on Sellers and its Affiliates competition with the Business. 

  

 6\. _Representations and Warranties of Buyer_. Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows: 

   

 (a) _Authority; No Conflicts_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri. Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. All corporate acts and other proceedings, including approval by Buyers board of directors, required to be taken by Buyer to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and properly taken. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer, and the Ancillary Agreements shall be duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute, or will constitute, as the case may be, valid and binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity) and except that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive relief and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought. 

  

 (ii) The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Buyer with the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien, claim, encumbrance, security interest, option, charge or restriction of any kind upon any of the properties or assets of Buyer under, or require any consent, authorization or approval under any provision of (A) the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of Buyer, (B) any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, contract, commitment, agreement or arrangement to which Buyer is a party or by which any of its properties or assets are bound, or (C) any judgment, order or decree, or any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Buyer or its property or assets, other than any such consent, authorization or approval required under the HSR Act or listed or described on _Schedule 3(a)(iii)_. 

  

 (b) _Actions and Proceedings, etc_. There are no (i) outstanding judgments, orders, writs, injunctions or decrees of any court, governmental agency or arbitration tribunal against Buyer which have or could have a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) actions, suits, claims or legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer, which directly relate to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (c) _Availability of Funds; Issuance of Stock_. At the Closing, if Buyer elects to pay the Base Purchase Price in cash, Buyer will have sufficient funds to enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer elects to pay the Base Purchase Price with Stock Consideration, the Buyer Preferred Stock comprising the Stock Consideration shall be duly and validly authorized, and not subject to any preemptive or similar rights with respect to its issuance, and when issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Common Stock Outstanding_. Buyers Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to Three Hundred Million (300,000,000) shares of common stock and Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. As of May 4, 2009, there are 58,359,170, shares of Buyer common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock have been issued. All presently outstanding shares of Buyer common stock have been validly issued, fully paid and are non-assessable. Except as set forth in Buyers Financial Statements, there are (i) no options, warrants, calls or agreements for the issuance of Buyer common stock, (ii) no contracts for the authorization or issuance of any other class of securities of Buyer, and (iii) no outstanding securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Buyer common stock or other equity securities of Buyer. 

   

 (e) _Buyer Financial Statements; SEC Filings and Compliance with Laws_. The Buyer Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations of Buyer, as of the dates thereof, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. All required periodic filings have been made by Buyer in compliance with federal securities laws and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or by any other applicable law, rule or regulation within the past three (3) years, have been made and, as of their respective filing dates, such filings did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent information contained in any such filing has been revised or superseded by a document filed at a later date, no filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor the Buyer Financial Statements, currently contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. During such three (3) year period, Buyer has complied in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, both as to form and substance. 

   

 (f) _Shareholder Vote_. No vote or other action by the stockholders of Buyer is required by law, Buyers articles of incorporation and bylaws, or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which the Buyer common stock is listed or quoted in order for Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

   

 7\. _Covenants of Buyer_. Buyer covenants as follows: 

   

 (a) _Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to any of it and its Affiliates, agents and representatives by Seller and its Affiliates, predecessors, agents and representatives is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Seller and Buyer or one of its Affiliates or other beneficial owners (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only with respect to information provided to Buyer or its Affiliates, agents or representatives that relates exclusively to the Business, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. The Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect with respect to any and all information provided or made available to Buyer and its Affiliates, agents and representatives by or on behalf of Seller concerning Seller and its Affiliates (other than information relating exclusively to the Business, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _No Additional Representations_. 

   

 (i) Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business, except as expressly set forth in _Section 4_ , including any implied representation or warranty as to the condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose of any of the Assets and that, except for the express representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Section 4_, Buyer takes the Assets on an "as is" and "where is" basis, and Buyer further agrees that neither Seller nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyers use of, any such information, including the Confidential Information Memorandum prepared by Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the " _Information Memorandum_ ") and any information, document, or material made available to Buyer in any "data rooms," management presentations or supplemental due diligence information provided to Buyer, in connection with discussions or access to management of the Business or in any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as specifically provided in _Section 11_. 

  

 (ii) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Business, Buyer has received certain projections, including projected statements of revenue, gross profit and product contribution of the Business for the fiscal year ending in June 2009 and certain other business information for such fiscal year and succeeding fiscal years. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates and projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Buyer shall have no claim against Seller with respect thereto. Accordingly, Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to such estimates and projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates and projections and forecasts). In addition, Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to information relating to historical operating profit set forth in the Information Memorandum, in any "data room" or management presentation, in any supplemental due diligence information provided to Buyer, in connection with discussions or access to management of the Business, or otherwise except as specifically provided in _Section 11_, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is not relying on any of the information referred to in this Section in any manner whatsoever. 

  

 (c) _Customer Notification; UPC Codes_. Buyer shall (i) within thirty (30) days following the Closing, send all customers of the Business, detailed in the Commercial Information, a written notice (as approved by Seller) of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, and request that all such customers change their respective billing and invoicing codes as appropriate to reflect the change in ownership of the Business and (ii) within three (3) years following the Closing, change all universal product codes or similar bar codes (" _UPC Codes_ ") relating to the Products. Buyer agrees to promptly reimburse Seller for all Losses that Seller may incur due to Buyers use of the Sellers UPC Codes after the Closing. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Employees_. Buyer acknowledges that the employees of the Seller and the Seller Entities are a key component to the success of the Seller and the Seller Entities and that the preservation of the employee base of the Seller and the Seller Entities is critical to, among other things, the prospects of the Seller. Consequently, Buyer agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall solicit to leave employment, hire or otherwise engage (except as permitted by the Transition Services Agreement) any individual who participated in the Business, either on a full-time or part-time basis, or any individual with whom Buyer or its representatives had contact during the due diligence and negotiation relating to the Acquisition, at any time between the date of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Closing Date, or in any way interfere with the employment relationship between the Seller and any such individual; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller agrees to negotiate in good faith with Buyer to determine whether to permit Buyer to solicit for employment any such dedicated Business employees that Buyer identifies in writing to Seller prior to the Closing as critical to its ongoing operation of the Business following the Closing to the extent that such employee remains employed by Seller; (ii) the above restrictions on solicitation and hiring shall not apply to any individual that has, without any solicitation or encouragement by Buyer, terminated his or her employment with Seller or a Seller Entity, and (iii) generalized advertisement of employment opportunities including in trade or industry publications (if not focused specifically on or directed in any way any such individual) shall not be deemed to cause a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions set forth herein. 

   

 8\. _Mutual Covenants_. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree as follows: 

   

 (a) _Consents_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or assign, directly or indirectly, any asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such asset if an attempted direct or indirect assignment thereof, without the consent, approval or authorization (" _Consent_ ") of a third party, would constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention of the rights of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such asset, claim or right, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of the Seller Entities or, upon transfer, Buyer under such asset, claim or right. If any direct or indirect transfer or assignment by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates to Buyer, or any direct or indirect acquisition or assumption by Buyer of, any interest in, or Liability under, any asset, claim or right requires the Consent of a third party, then such transfer or assignment or assumption shall be made subject to such Consent being obtained. At Buyers written request prior to the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for up to one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing in any reasonable manner (not including the payment of any consideration or the concession of any right) in connection with Buyers obtaining any such Consents. 

  

 (ii) If any such Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place on the terms set forth herein and then the legal interest in such Assets requiring such Consent shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed unless and until such Consent or waiver thereof is obtained. For one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (not including the payment of any consideration or concession of any right) to secure such Consent as promptly as practicable 

   ##### 

  

    

after the Closing and Seller shall provide or cause to be provided all
commercially reasonable assistance to Buyer (not including the payment of any
consideration or concession of any right) reasonably requested by Buyer to
secure such Consent. Pending receipt of any such Consent, Seller shall hold
any such non-assigned asset, claim or right for the benefit and at the risk
of Buyer and shall cooperate with Buyer, without the payment of any
additional consideration by Buyer, in any lawful and commercially
reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer designed to provide the
benefits of ownership thereof to Buyer and under which (i) Buyer shall obtain
(without infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or violating
any applicable law) the economic claims, rights and benefits under the asset,
claim or right with respect to which the Consent has not been obtained in
accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall assume any related
economic burden (including the amount of any related tax costs imposed on
Seller, any of the Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates)
with respect to the asset, claim or right with respect to which the Consent
has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) Buyer acknowledges that the contracts and arrangements that are listed or described on  _Schedule 8(a)(iii)_ attached hereto shall not constitute Assets and shall not be assigned by Seller or the applicable Seller Entity to Buyer (such contracts and arrangements being referred to herein as the " _Shared Contracts_ "). With respect to a Shared Contract, at Buyers written request prior to the Closing and for up to one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate (without the payment of any consideration or concession of any right) with Buyer in a commercially reasonable manner in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain the agreement of the other party or parties to any such Shared Contract to enter into a separate agreement with Buyer with respect to the matters covered by such Shared Contract as they relate to the Business. Buyer agrees that neither Seller nor any Seller Entity shall have any liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such separate agreement or the breach of any separate agreement between any third party and Buyer. 

  

 (b) _Cooperation_. 

   

 (i) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate as reasonably requested for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing (or for such longer period to the extent required by the Transition Services Agreement) to provide for an orderly transition of the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to Buyer and to minimize the disruption to the respective businesses of the parties hereto resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 8(a)_, each party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this _Section 8(b)(i)_. No party shall be required by this  _Section 8(b)(i)_ to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business. 

  

 (ii) Buyer and Seller agree and acknowledge that Seller is entitled to any and all proceeds from accounts receivable relating to the Business that were outstanding as of the Closing Date and Buyer is entitled to any and all proceeds from accounts receivable relating to the Business that arise on or after the Closing Date. Each party agrees to forward to the other any accounts receivable received by such party but to which such receiving party is not entitled in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section 8(b)(ii)_ together with appropriate supporting documentation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) Buyer and Seller will cooperate with each other in the defense or settlement of any lawsuits involving the Business for which they have responsibility under this Agreement by providing the other party and such other partys legal counsel and other designated Persons, reasonable access to employees, records, documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other information regarding the Business as such other party may reasonably request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or control of the requested party. The requesting party shall reimburse the other party for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing its obligations under this _Section 8(b)(iii)_. 

  

 (iv) Seller acknowledges Buyers desire to develop, within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, pro forma financial statements of the Business as of and for the year ended September 30, 2008, and as of and for the six (6) months ended March 31, 2009, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. To that end, Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or to cause to be provided by its Affiliates or its independent auditor such financial information with respect to the Business as Buyer may reasonably request in order to prepare such pro forma financial statements. Seller also agrees to provide Buyer reasonable access during normal business hours to its personnel, to assist Buyer, as Buyer may reasonably require or request, in the preparation of such financial statements. Buyer and its independent auditor shall also be permitted to review the supporting work papers for the information provided to the extent such information is exclusively related to the Business. Buyer agrees to promptly reimburse Seller for all expenses associated with providing such information and assistance to it. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Seller makes and will make no representation or warranty with respect to such information and that Seller will not have any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from Buyers use of such information. 

  

 (c) _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date and, upon the request of either Seller or Buyer, at the time of the signing of this Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by any party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Seller and Buyer shall also coordinate announcements to employees of Seller and/or the Seller Entities and of Buyer upon signing of this Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required by applicable law or for financial reporting purposes and except that the parties may disclose such terms to their respective accountants and other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons are bound to an obligation requiring them to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential); _provided_ , _however_ , that any party may make a public disclosure it believes in good faith after consultation with legal counsel is required by law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which the Buyer Common Stock is listed or quoted, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification of Certain Matters_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including taking all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each of Seller and Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section 3_ not being satisfied. Seller shall give prompt notice to Buyer and Buyer shall give prompt notice to Seller of (i) the occurrence of any event of which such notifying party has knowledge which would cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the Effective Time; and (ii) any material failure of Buyer (on the one hand) or Seller (on the other hand), as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8(d)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

   

 (e) _Compliance_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with all applicable laws relating to competition and shall promptly provide any supplemental information requested by applicable governmental entities relating thereto. Buyer and Seller shall bear the costs and expenses of their respective filings;  _provided_ _that_ that Buyer shall pay all filing fees in connection therewith. Each of Seller and Buyer shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act or such other applicable law. Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable governmental entity and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental information requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act or such other applicable law. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act or such other applicable law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall take any and all actions necessary to ensure that (x) no requirement of or waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or other governmental entity, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition law or regulation, would preclude consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Outside Date. 

   

 (f) _Sales and Transfer Taxes, etc_. 

   

 (i) All sales, use, gross receipts, excise, value-added, business, goods and services, transfer, recording, documentary, registration, duties, conveyancing taxes or similar taxes or expenses that may be imposed as a result of the sale and transfer of the Assets 

   ##### 

  

    

(excluding any filing or recording fees or expenses payable in connection
with the sale and transfer, and recordation of such transfer, of the Primary
Intellectual Property and the Other Intellectual Property, which is governed
by _Section 2(a)(ii)_), including and any duty or other tax chargeable in
respect of any instrument transferring property, together with any and all

50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and
submit all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply

other similar tax and fee documentation. 

  

 (ii) With respect to registrations and applications for registration of the Primary Intellectual Property and the Other Intellectual Property included in the Assets, Buyer shall prepare, and Seller shall deliver at Closing or, upon the written request of Buyer within two (2) years after the Closing, customary assignments of such registrations and applications for registration in a form appropriate for recordation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding governmental agencies or authorities responsible for intellectual property registrations in other appropriate jurisdictions, it being understood that the responsibility for and cost of preparing and legalizing any such documents shall be borne by Buyer, and the responsibility for and cost for governmental recordation fees shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller, provided that Seller shall not be liable for any amount in excess of $100,000 nor shall Seller be liable for any counsel or service provider fees. 

  

 (g) _Transition Matters_. 

   

 (i) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer copies of the Promotional Materials and the Commercial Information, in each case to the extent that such Promotional Materials and Commercial Information are in the possession of the Seller Entities or Seller. Except as otherwise provided in the Ancillary Agreements or this Agreement, following the Closing, Seller shall recognize Buyers title to the Primary Trademarks and the trademarks included in the Other Intellectual Property, and shall not use such trademarks in its or any of its Affiliates corporate name, business name, internet domain name, electronic mail addresses, as metatags, or in any other manner whatsoever. Seller will not seek to register such trademarks in its name nor authorize the use of any configuration, trademark, trade names or other designation confusingly similar to any of such trademarks. Notwithstanding the above, however, Buyer agrees that Seller and the Seller Entities may use any Promotional Materials that refer to or relate to the Business but that do not relate exclusively to the Business (the " _SCJ Materials_ "), for up to one (1) year following the Closing Date. 

  

 (ii) After the Closing, Buyer shall not use any Excluded Marks for any purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted, solely for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date, (A) to use in commerce or publicly display the Promotional Materials that bear Excluded Marks, and (B) to use the existing packaging materials and labels included in the Transferred Inventory that bear the Excluded Marks, in each case exclusively in connection with the distribution, marketing and sale of finished Products included in the Transferred Inventory in a manner consistent with Sellers practices prior to the Closing. Buyer shall destroy all Promotional Materials, packaging 

   ##### 

  

    

materials and labels bearing the Excluded Marks on or prior to the expiration
of such period. Within one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall remove all Excluded Marks from all properties and assets
included in the Assets.

 (b) _Obligations Upon Termination_. In the event of termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to this _Section 9_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by any party.

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) all confidential information received by Buyer with respect to the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Business shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Section 9_, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (i) _Section 7(a)_ relating to the obligation of Buyer to keep confidential certain information and data obtained by it, (ii) _Section 8(c)_ relating to publicity, (iii) _Section 15_ relating to certain expenses, (iv) _Section 16_ relating to finders fees and brokers fees and (v) this _Section 9_.

In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than tort claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may have against Seller or any Seller Entity relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. 

   

 (c) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify each of Seller, the Seller Entities, their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby which survives the Closing, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby requiring performance after the Closing Date, (iii) any failure of Buyer to pay, discharge or perform any of the Assumed Liabilities, (iv) any guarantee or obligation to assure performance given or made by Seller, any Seller Entity or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any of the Assumed Liabilities, and (v) except as otherwise expressly provided in the Ancillary Agreements, any and all Liabilities, actions, suits, claims and other proceedings which arise directly or indirectly out of the operation of the Business or use of the Assets after the Closing, including those arising pursuant to Buyers exercise of the rights granted in _Sections 8(g)_ of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) Buyer shall not have any liability under clause (i) above for breaches of representations and warranties unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Buyer would, but for this limitation, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) (and then the Buyer shall be liable for the full extent of such Indemnified Losses, including the aforementioned four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000)); (B) Buyer shall not have any liability under clause (i) above for any individual item where the Loss relating to such item is less than $25,000, and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the first limitation in this _Section 11(c)_; (C) Buyers aggregate liability under clause (i) of this _Section 11(c)_ shall in no event exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Final Purchase Price; and (D) Buyers aggregate liability under this  _Section 11(c)_ shall in no

Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for tax purposes. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to _Sections 11(a)(i)_, _11(a)(ii)_ , _11(c)(i)_ and  _11(c)(ii)_ shall terminate when any such representation or warranty terminates pursuant to  _Section 10_ or, in the case of a covenant, three (3) months after the period of performance of any such covenant has expired; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified or the related party thereto shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) to the indemnifying party. The obligation to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to the other clauses of  _Sections 11(a)_ and _11(c)_ shall not terminate. 

   

 (f) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

   

 (i) In order for a party (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within twenty-five (25) days after the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

  

 (ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its indemnification responsibility hereunder, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding any acknowledgment made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the indemnifying party shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility contained in the limitations set forth in _Section 11(a)_ or _Section 11(c)_, as the case may be. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses 

   ##### 

  

    

subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified
party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period
during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all
the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 12\. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto, the other party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8(a)_ and _Section 8(b)_), as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 

   

 13\. _Assignment_. Except as set forth below, this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer or Seller (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or sale of stock, or sale of substantially all the assets, of Buyer or Seller) without the prior written consent of the other party and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect. Buyer may designate in a writing provided to Seller prior to the Closing one or more directly or indirectly wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries to take title to the Assets, assume the Assumed Liabilities and perform other obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligations relating to the issuance of Buyer Preferred Stock, if the Base Purchase Price is paid in Stock Consideration) and the Ancillary Agreements, and upon such designation, for such purposes, the term " _Buyer_ " shall mean such designated subsidiary or subsidiaries; _provided_ , that Energizer Holdings, Inc. will remain obligated to perform (and shall not be released from) all of its obligations hereunder. 

   

 14\. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or implied (including _Section 7(d)_ and _Section 11_) shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. 

   

 15\. _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 8(e)_, _Section 8(f)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses. 

     ##### 

 

   

 16\. _Brokerage_. Buyer has not used a broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and there are no claims for brokerage commissions, finders fees or similar compensation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any arrangement or agreement by or on behalf of Buyer, except pursuant to an arrangement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. for which Buyer is solely responsible. Seller has not retained any broker or finder or incurred any Liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except pursuant to an arrangement with Goldman, Sachs and Co., for which Seller is solely responsible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 9_, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any breach of its representation in this _Section 16_, and Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any breach of its representation in this _Section 16_. 

   

 17\. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, or any provision of this Agreement may be waived;  _provided_ _that_ any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon a party only if set forth in a writing executed by such party and referring specifically to the provision alleged to have been amended or waived. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 18\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications permitted or required to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed conclusively to have been given (i) when personally delivered, (ii) when sent by facsimile (with hard copy to follow) during a business day (or on the next business day if sent after the close of normal business hours or on any non-business day), (iii) when sent by electronic mail (with hard copy to follow) during a business day (or on the next business day if sent after the close of normal business hours or on any non-business day), (iv) one (1) business day after being sent by reputable overnight express courier (charges prepaid), or (v) three (3) business days following mailing by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.

 21\. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. 

   

 22\. _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all other parties. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through 

    ##### 

  

    

the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent

In addition, matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. 

   

 25\. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Assets.

 26\. _Specific Performance_. Each of Seller and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event that the Acquisition is not consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

    ##### 

  

    

officer who has no direct operational responsibility for the matters
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Representatives_ "). The
Representatives shall promptly meet in a good faith effort to resolve the
dispute. If the Representatives do not agree upon a decision within thirty
(30) calendar days after reference of the matter to them, each of Buyer, and
Seller shall be free to exercise the remedies available to it under _Section
26_ and _Section 28(b)_. 

   

 (b) _Arbitration_.

Such arbitration shall be administered by the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolutions (the " _Institute_ ") in accordance with its then prevailing Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes (except as otherwise provided herein), by three independent and impartial arbitrators, one of whom shall be appointed by Seller, one of whom shall be appointed by Buyer and one of whom shall be appointed by the other arbitrators. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in _Section 28_ hereof, the arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 _et_ _seq_. The fees and expenses of the Institute and the arbitrators shall be shared equally by the parties and advanced by them from time to time as required; _provided_ _that_ at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrators shall award costs and expenses (including the costs of the arbitration previously advanced and the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts) and interest at the Applicable Rate to the prevailing party. No pre-arbitration discovery shall be permitted, except that the arbitrators shall have the power in their sole discretion, on application by either party, to order pre-arbitration examination of the witnesses and documents that the other party intends to introduce in its case-in-chief at the arbitration hearing. The arbitrators shall render their award within ninety (90) days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. The arbitrators shall not be empowered to award to either party any consequential, special, exemplary, indirect or punitive damages or lost profits in connection with any dispute between them arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or the transactions arising hereunder or thereunder, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this _Section 28(b)_ and without prejudice to the above procedures, either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief if such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo until such time as the arbitration panel is convened and available to hear such partys request for temporary relief. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and not subject to judicial review and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The term " _Standards_ " shall mean quality control procedures, finished goods and component performance tests, acceptable quality limits and all other information relating to the manufacture, packaging or labeling of the Products that were used by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date, as each of the foregoing may be adjusted in each case from time to time pursuant to Change Orders or otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 1.3 _Specifications_. The term " _Specifications_ " shall mean manufacturing formulae, processing instructions, and finished goods and packaging specifications for the Products. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.4 _Performance_. Subject to and on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller shall perform the Services in accordance with the Standards, which standards reflect the performance of services in a manner that is generally consistent with (i) the level of support for the Products provided by Seller immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (ii) the ongoing level of performance of services provided by Seller to Sellers other businesses after the Effective Date. Subject to and on the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Seller shall supply Products meeting the Specifications to Buyer pursuant to Purchase Orders. 

  

 1.5 _Changes to Specifications and Standards_. The Specifications and Standards shall not be changed except in accordance with _Article 6_ or this _Section 1.5_. Notwithstanding _Article 6_, Seller may make changes to the Standards that do not constitute changes to the Specifications for the physical Product, to the extent Seller also makes similar changes to the standards used for Sellers other products, and Buyer may make changes to the Specifications with respect to graphics displayed on the Products packaging. Supplier shall have provided Buyer with the Specifications and Standards reasonably available to Seller prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement. 

  

 1.6 _Packing_. Buyer shall be responsible for all co-packing arrangements associated with, but not limited to, shrink-wrapped Products, display cases and warehouse club packaging. 

  

 1.7 _Defects in Products_. Buyer shall bear any losses due to Defective Products or otherwise unsalable Products to the extent that the Defective Products or otherwise unsalable Products are attributable to a change in the Specifications or Standards requested by Buyer. 

  

 1.8 _Purchase of Materials_.

 2. _Inspection by Buyer_. 

  

 2.1 _Inspection at Seller Facilities_. Buyer may inspect the Products at reasonable times, after written notice to Seller, and in a reasonable manner, at the Waxdale Facility, subject to Buyers compliance with Sellers policies and procedures, during and after manufacture. 

  

 2.2 _Defective Products_. The term " _Defective Product_ " shall mean a Product manufactured by Seller that has a Critical Defect. The term " _Critical Defect_ " shall mean a defect in the Product that is a significant non-conformance with the Specifications that would (i) cause harm to Persons, (ii) violate applicable law, or (iii) substantially fail to meet the quality control procedures in the Standards.

   ##### 

  

    

Products, Buyer may give Seller written notice thereof rejecting such
Defective Products. In the event that Buyer provides Seller with such written
notice, Seller shall give Buyer return authorization instructions, which

Product does not have Critical Defect, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
Sellers costs associated with the return and re-shipment of such Product.

Seller shall promptly replace a Defective Product or issue a credit to Buyer, at Buyers option, for any Defective Product within thirty (30) days of Sellers receipt of the returned Defective Product. Seller shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of returned Defective Product from Buyer, either notify Buyer that Seller will issue a credit to Buyer or, at Buyers option, advise Buyer as to the estimated delivery date of the replacement of the Defective Product.

 3. _Buyer Purchase and Seller Production Obligations_. 

  

 3.1 _Forecast_. Each month, Buyer shall provide Seller with Buyers non-binding forecasted requirements of the Products based on Buyers estimated production forecast (each forecast, a " _Forecast_ ") for the subsequent twelve (12)-month period.

If Buyer requests manufacturing capacity in excess of the Capacity, Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in good faith to identify available options with respect to the manufacture of additional quantities of Products. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate in attempting to optimize production schedules in the event of product seasonality, promotional activity and other account activity that may result in short-term capacity constraints. For the purposes of this _Section 3.2_, the term " _Capacity_ " with respect to any line is based on three (3) shifts per day and five (5) days per week.

Seller shall retain risk of loss until title passes. 

  

 5. _Price and Payment_. 

  

 5.1 _Payment Calculation_. Buyer shall pay Seller for each Product delivered pursuant to this Agreement an amount equal to (i) (a) the cost of inputs including materials, labor, depreciation, conversions costs, loss factors, the cost for routine maintenance of the equipment used in the manufacture of the Product (as set forth in the preventive maintenance policy in the Standards), the cost of minor repairs to the equipment used exclusively in the manufacture of the Product, and overhead, each calculated using Sellers costing methodology (this cost, the 

   #####

any Changes to the Standards or the Specifications in accordance with an
applicable Change Order (the sum of (a) plus (b), the " _Base Price_ "),
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Markup Percentage (the result of such formula yields
the " _Product Price_ " for each Product). The " _Markup Percentage_ " means
(w) 100% for the first three (3) years of the Term, (x) 104% for the
fourth year of the Term, (y) 107% for the fifth year of the Term, and, if
this Agreement is renewed, (z) 107% for any Renewal Term.

At least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of a new Seller Fiscal Year, and subsequent to a collaboration meeting of Buyer and Seller as provided in _Exhibit C_, Seller will update _Exhibit A_ to reflect the Product Price for the Products to be delivered in the subsequent Seller Fiscal Year. Seller will provide Buyer with quarterly reports reflecting variances in purchase prices of raw materials, components, and packaging materials, and direct labor overtime (above the amount of overtime included in the Standard Cost), incurred during the immediately preceding fiscal quarter and Buyers payment obligations shall be adjusted in accordance with _Section 5.4_.

If the total of subparts (ii) and (iii) ("together the " _Payment Adjustment Items_ ") of the previous sentence exceeds a positive $250,000, Seller shall invoice Buyer for an amount equal to the difference and Buyer shall remit such amount to Seller within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of the invoice. If the amount paid by Buyer is more than $250,000 over the value of the Payment Adjustment Items, then Seller shall remit the difference to Buyer within thirty (30) days of Sellers final determination of the applicable Base Price and the Payment Adjustment Items. 

  

 5.5 _Equipment Maintenance_. In the event that any of the Equipment requires repairs (outside of maintenance included in the Standard Costs) or requires capital improvements, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. Seller shall not undertake such repairs or capital improvements without a Change Order. Subject to the remainder of this sentence, Seller shall have no liability whatsoever, including liability for direct and consequential damages, with respect to any delay in Delivery to the extent that a delay is caused by the need for any repairs or capital improvements; provided that each party is responsible for repairs and related damages caused by their grossly negligent or intentional wrongful act or omission ( _e.g._ , Sellers grossly negligent failure to notice the need for timely repair). If the parties agree to a Change Order for any repair or capital improvement, Seller shall invoice Buyer for the verifiable direct cost of such 

   ##### 

  

    

repair or capital improvement and Buyer shall make full payment to Seller in
accordance with  _Section 5.7_. 

  

 5.6 _Payment for Raw Materials, Components, and Packaging Materials_.

Seller shall dispose of such items as directed by Buyer, and Buyer shall make full payment to Seller in accordance with _Section 5.7_. 

  

 5.7 _Payment_. Buyer shall make full payment to Seller of all invoiced amounts under this Agreement in United States dollars within fifteen (15) days after the date of the invoice.

 5.8 _Offset_. Buyers obligation to make payments to Seller under this Agreement shall not be subject to offset or reduction by reason of any amounts alleged to be owing from Seller to Buyer, whether pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 5.9 _Taxes_.

From the Effective Date through the Termination Date (as defined in _Section 8_ below), Seller shall provide to Buyer in connection with the Business, on the terms set forth herein, the services specifically listed on _Schedule A_ attached hereto (the " _Transition Services_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, tasks necessary to accomplish the Transition Services, even if such tasks are not expressly set forth on Schedule A, shall be deemed to be part of the Transition Services to be performed hereunder. 

  

 (b) _Delegation of Transition Services_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent any Transition Services were outsourced and provided by a third party during the twelve (12)-month period prior to the Effective Date, Seller shall be permitted to continue to outsource such Transition Services without the review or approval of Buyer. In the event that Seller outsources Transition Services, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable regarding such outsourcing services Seller acknowledges that notwithstanding any delegation of their responsibilities under this Agreement, they shall remain responsible for the provision of the Transition Services and the third partys compliance with the standard of performance set forth herein. __  

  

 (c) _Standards of Performance_. With respect to a given Transition Service, Seller shall provide the Transition Services in substantially the same manner and scope, in substantially the same quality, and with substantially the same degree of care and diligence that Seller exercises or has exercised historically in providing such Transition Service to 

   ##### 

  

    

itself. Seller represents and warrants that no condition exists which is
reasonably likely to interfere in any material respect with Sellers ability
to provide the Transition Services in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Compliance with Laws and Regulations. Seller shall perform or provide the Transition Services in accordance in all material respects with all applicable laws. 

  

2. _Pricing_. The fees for each Transition Service shall be the amounts set forth on  _Schedule A_. A fixed monthly fee shall be payable for each Transition Service that continues to be provided pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Remaining Services_ ") following the completion or termination of field sales force and related services as specified in  _Schedule A_. 

  

3. _Settlement Report_. Within 15 days following the end of each fiscal month of Seller during the term of this Agreement, or until such time as the applicable services are no longer provided by the Seller, the Seller shall complete and submit to Buyer a monthly Settlement Report. This report will detail the Account Revenue of the Business (calculated as Gross Sales less sales deductions) to the extent earned by Seller under this Agreement and will detail and subtract from such Account Revenue all amounts owed to Seller under this Agreement. Negative amounts resulting from such subtraction shall be owed to Seller. The Settlement Report will provide sufficient detail to allow Buyer to reasonably review and understand the Account Revenue and all amounts owed to Seller under this Agreement. The Seller shall remit, or in the case where amounts are owed to Seller, Buyer shall remit, in immediately available funds, the net cash due as determined on the Settlement Report, within 15 days of submission of the Settlement Report, with interest to accrue at a rate of 10% per annum for late payment. 

  

4. _Payment for Inventory_. For the period Seller provides sales and distribution services, Buyer shall make payment within 15 days of the reconciliation date in respect of inventory services occurring during the preceding fiscal month equal to an amount equal to the number of physical cases produced of Products or received from co-packers and contract manufacturers by individual Product, in each case, received during the applicable fiscal month (or portion thereof), multiplied by the applicable cost of each Product. At Buyers request, Seller will provide a reconciliation of Product inventory showing the result of (i) the sum of (A) Product inventory at the beginning of each fiscal month, (B) the quantity of Products produced during such fiscal month, (C) the quantity of Products received from contract manufacturers during such fiscal month and (D) the quantity of Products returned by customers during such fiscal month, reduced by (ii) the quantity of Products shipped to customers during such fiscal month. 

  

5. _Representatives_. Seller and Buyer shall each designate, from time to time, a representative to act as Sellers and Buyers respective primary contact persons to coordinate the provision of all of the Transition Services (collectively, the " _Primary Coordinators_ "). Each Primary Coordinator may designate one or more service coordinators for each specific Transition Service (the " _Service Coordinators_ "). Each Party may treat an act of a Primary Coordinator of another Party as being authorized by such other Party without inquiring behind such act or ascertaining whether such Primary Coordinator had authority to so act, and each Party may treat an act of a Service Coordinator as being authorized by such other 

   ##### 

  

    

Party only to the extent such act is directly related to the
Transition Service for which such Service Coordinator has been designated;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Primary Coordinator or Service
Coordinator has authority to amend this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall
advise each other promptly (and in any event within seven (7) days)
in writing of any change in the Primary Coordinators and any Service
Coordinator for a particular Transition Service. Seller and Buyer agree that
all communications relating to the provision of the Transition Services shall
be directed to the Service Coordinators for such Transition Service
with copies to the Primary Coordinators.

 (a) _General Support_. Seller shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide the Transition Services using same personnel who provided such services to the Business during the 12 months prior to Closing. 

  

 (b) _Compensation._ Seller shall continue awarding annual quota-based incentives (dependent on the performance of the Business) to field sales employees who in the ordinary course received such awards based all or in part on Business performance prior to Closing. Eligibility for such awards shall be based upon the performance of the Business during the portion of year in which Transition Services are performed. 

  

7. _Cooperation_. During the term of this Agreement, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other as reasonably requested in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Transition Services. 

  

8. _Term; Termination_. 

  

 (a) _Service Term_. _Schedule A_ sets forth the term for each Transition Service. 

  

 (b) _Early Termination_. Buyer may terminate the provision of any Transition Service (in whole or in part) 15 days following the date upon which Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer no longer requires Seller to provide such Transition Service or such shorter notice period as Buyer may determine with the consent of Seller in its sole discretion; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for North America, Field Sales, Distribution, Finance / IT and Inventory services (the " _Linked Services_ ") may only be terminated together at the same time. Any election to terminate any Transition Service or a portion thereof shall not relieve Buyer of the obligation to pay for any terminated Transition Services that are provided prior to the effective date of such termination. 

  

 (c) _Termination of the Entire Agreement_. The provision of Transition Services shall commence on the Effective Date and shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of the following (the "Termination Date"): 

  

 (i) _ _ _ _, 2010; 

   

 (ii) 15 days following the date upon which Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer no longer requires Seller to provide any Transition Services; and 

   

 (d) _Effect of Termination or Expiration_. Upon termination or expiration of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement for any reason, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all records and other
information pertaining to any matters for which Seller was providing
Transition Services to Buyer hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , Seller may
retain copies of such records and information to the extent necessary for
accounting, tax reporting, or compliance with Sellers document
retention policies, subject to the requirements of _Section 12_ hereof.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that after partial termination of this
Agreement by Buyer with respect to any particular Transition Service, Buyer
shall not have any payment obligations pursuant to _Section 2_ hereof
with respect to such Transition Service performed after the effective date of
such termination and that a partial termination of this Agreement by Buyer
with respect to any particular Transition Service will not affect Sellers
obligation to perform any other Transition Services hereunder. Following any
termination of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller agree and acknowledge that in
the event that either of them receives monies or invoices that should have
properly been directed to the other, such monies or invoices will be promptly
delivered to such other Party. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other
to give effect to the provisions of the foregoing sentence. At
Buyers reasonable request, upon partial termination of this Agreement by
Buyer with respect to any particular Transition Service, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer all records and other information exclusively related to such
terminated Transition Services subject to the same rights to retain copies of
the same contained in the proviso above. 

  

 (e) _Survival_. _Section 8(d)_ (Effect of Termination or Expiration), _Section 8(e)_ (Survival), _Section 9_ (Disclaimer of Warranties), _Section 10_ (Indemnification), _Section 11_ (Limitation of Liability), _Section 12_ (Confidentiality) and _Section_ 14 (Miscellaneous) shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

10. _Indemnification_. Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and each of its Affiliates against all Losses attributable to any third party claims arising from or relating to the provision of the Transition Services, except to the extent that such damages, losses, liabilities or costs arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Seller or any of its Affiliates, employees or subcontractors; _provided_ that in the absence of gross negligence or intentional misconduct on Buyers part, the liability of Buyer for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 9 shall in the aggregate not exceed the total amount paid or payable to Seller by the Buyer under this Agreement. 

  

11. _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates, shareholders, directors, managers, officers, partners, members, employees, agents or representatives have any liability, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or any other legal or equitable grounds, for any consequential, special, exemplary, indirect or punitive damages or lost profits in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or any of the Transition Services to be provided hereunder or the performance of or failure to perform Sellers obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether such damages are foreseeable or an authorized representative of Seller is advised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages. Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover any damages of the type listed in the preceding sentence. 

  

12. _Confidentiality_. The Parties obligations of confidentiality regarding information received in connection with this Agreement or otherwise related to Transition Services shall be subject to and controlled by the provisions of Sections 5(c)(ii) and 7(a) of the Purchase Agreement. 

  

13. _Force Majeure_. Any failure or omission by a Party in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or create any liability, if the same arises from any cause or causes beyond the control of such Party, including the following, which, for purposes of this Agreement shall be regarded as beyond the control of each of the parties hereto: acts of God, fire, storm, flood, earthquake, governmental regulation or direction, acts of the public enemy, war, rebellion, insurrection, riot, invasion, strike or lockout;  _provided_ that the non-performing Party must give prompt written notice to the other party of such cause or causes and exercise all reasonable effort to eliminate such cause or causes and resume performance of its affected obligations as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to pay for the affected Transition Services during the pendency of an event of force majeure and the term of such affected Transition Services shall be extended by the length of time during which any force majeure event remains. 

  

14. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) _Right to Determine Priority_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5_, if there is a conflict between the business needs of Seller or its Affiliates and the provision of any Transition Service to Buyer (for example, if the same employee is needed to work on both a Transition Service and work product needed by Seller or its Affiliates), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and cooperate to optimize schedules and identify available options to 

   ##### 

  

    

address both Parties needs. Buyer acknowledges that there may be short-term
constraints on Sellers ability to provide Transition Services, but that such
constraints shall be ameliorated as soon as practicable. 

  

 (b) _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

shall be responsible for any breach of such terms and conditions by any
such sublicensee, and (z) Seller or its Affiliates shall enter into an
agreement with such sublicensee providing that Buyer shall be an intended

     7.  |   | _Indemnification_.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify
each of Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors,
employees and agents against and hold such Indemnified Party harmless from
any Losses suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party to the extent
arising from: (i) any product liability Claim made by any Person relating to
any product or service covered by any Licensed IP that is used, made, sold,
offered to sell, marketed, distributed, improved upon, or imported by
Buyer or any of its sublicensees; or (ii) breach of Buyers obligations or
covenants hereunder.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall indemnify
each of Buyer, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors,
employees and agents against and hold such Indemnified Party harmless from
any Losses suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party to the extent
arising from: (i) any product liability Claim made by any Person relating to
any product or service covered by any Licensed IP that is used, made, sold,
offered to sell, marketed, distributed, improved upon, or imported by Seller
or any of its sublicensees; or (ii) breach of Sellers obligations or
covenants hereunder.  
      
    | (c)  |   | _Procedure_.  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled
to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of,
arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
within five (5) business days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified
Party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its indemnification
responsibility hereunder, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected
by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall control such
defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which
the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the
indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party and Seller shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

       | (a)  |   | _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and
when requested by either Party, the other Party shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions (subject to the
limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement), as such other Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Assignment_. This Agreement and any rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and any purported assignment or transfer
without such consent shall be void and without effect; provided, however,
that (i) Buyer may assign and transfer its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, without consent of Seller, to an acquirer of all or substantially
all of the assets of Buyer or to an entity into which Buyer is merged (in
each case, except for any material competitor of Seller); provided
further, however, that such rights, when assigned and transferred, shall
apply only to the products and services of the acquired business of Buyer or
of the portion of the merged business reflecting the acquired business of
Buyer, and such rights shall not apply under any circumstances to any other
products or services of the acquiring party or of the merged business; and
(ii) Seller may assign and transfer its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, without consent of Buyer, to an acquirer of all or any portion
of the Licensed IP to the extent of such sold or assigned Licensed IP
provided that such acquirer agrees to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. This _Section 8(b)_ does not apply to assignment or transfer of
each Partys rights and obligations under  _Section 3(d)_, which shall be
addressed by _Section 3(d)(ii)_.  
      
    | (c)  |   | _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns
and nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to
any Person, other than the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder.

       | (d)  |   | _Expenses_. Whether or not the transaction
contemplated hereby is consummated, and except as otherwise specifically
provided in the Purchase Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such costs or expenses.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended,
or any provision of this Agreement may be waived; provided that any such
amendment or waiver shall be binding upon a Party only if set forth in a
writing executed by such Party and referring specifically to the provision
alleged to have been amended or waived. No course of dealing between or among
any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective
to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.  
      
    | (f)  |   | _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications permitted or required to be given or delivered under or by
reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the

 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS  

  

 _SERIES [A] NON-VOTING PREFERRED STOCK_  

  

(Pursuant to Section 351.180 of the 
 Missouri General and Business Corporation Law)  

  

 Energizer Holdings, Inc. (the " _Corporation_ "), a corporation organized and existing under the General and Business Corporation Law of the State of Missouri (" _MBCL_ "), in accordance with Section 351.180 thereof, hereby certifies: 

  

 That the Board of Directors of the Corporation, at a meeting duly convened and held on  _ _, 2009, pursuant to authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors by the Corporations Articles of Incorporation, adopted the following resolution creating a series of Three Hundred Ten Thousand (310,000) shares of the Corporations Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, designated as Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock: 

  

 RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") by the Corporations Articles of Incorporation, the Board hereby creates a series of the Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Corporation (the " _Preferred Stock_ ") and hereby states that the designation and number of shares thereof, and the relative, participating, optional and other rights of the shares of such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, are as follows: 

  

 1.1 _Designation and Amount_. There shall be a series of the Preferred Stock which shall be designated as the "Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock," par value $.01 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall be Three Hundred Ten Thousand (310,000). Each share of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other share of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock. [The Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be subordinate, and rank junior in right of payment, to all indebtedness of the Corporation and may only receive payments pursuant to this Certificate of Designation as provided for herein. 

  

 1.2 _Dividends_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the " _Holders_ "), in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share of the Corporation (the " _Common Stock_ "), and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive semi-annual dividends payable in cash with respect to each Dividend Period in an amount per share equal to the rate of (i) 6% per annum on the Original Series [A] Issue Price from and including [June 30, 2009] (the " _Original Issuance Date_ ") to and including December 31, 2010, (ii) 9% per annum on the Original Series [A] Issue Price from and including January 1, 2011 to and including June 30, 2012, 

   ##### 

  

   

and (iii) 12% per annum on the Original Series [A] Issue Price from and
including July 1, 2012 to and including the June 29, 2019. The " _Mandatory
Redemption Date_ " shall mean June 29, 2019. " _Dividend Period_ " shall mean
the period commencing on and including a Dividend Payment Date (other than
the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the Original
Issue Date of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock) and shall end on and
include the calendar day next preceding the next Dividend Payment Date). 

  

Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the Original Issue Date
and shall be payable on _ _ and _ _
of each year, commencing on _ _ (each a "
_Dividend Payment Date_ "), provided that if any such Dividend Payment Date
would not otherwise occur on a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in St.
Louis, Missouri generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation
or executive order to close (a " _Business Day_ "), such Dividend Payment
Date shall instead be (and any dividend payable on Series [A] Non-Voting
Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date shall instead be payable on)
the immediately succeeding Business Day. Dividends shall be payable in
arrears on the first Dividend Payment Date after such Dividend Period.
Dividends that are payable on the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock on
any Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to Holders as they appear on the
stock register of the Corporation on the record date for such dividend, which
shall be the date fifteen days prior to the applicable Dividend Payment
Date. 

  

Dividends payable on the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock in respect of
any Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of dividends payable at the
Dividend Rate on the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock on any date prior
to the end of a Dividend Period, and for the initial Dividend Period, shall
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months, and actual days elapsed over a 30-day month. The " _Original Series
[A] Issue Price_" shall mean $1,000 per share, subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination
or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series [A] Non-Voting
Preferred Stock. 

  

If the Corporation fails to pay a full dividend in cash on the Series [A] Non-
Voting Preferred Stock, then dividends on the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred
Stock shall continue to accrue and accumulate as provided in this Section
1.2(a), compounded semi-annually, with the amount of such additional dividend
accrual being added to other past due dividends (and being referred to
herein, together with the aggregate accrued amount of all such unpaid
dividends, as the "Past Due Dividends") up to and including the date that all
such Past Due Dividends shall have been declared and paid in full. 

  

(b) Cash dividends shall be paid only to the extent the Corporation has funds
legally available for such payment and the Board, or an authorized committee
thereof, declares a dividend payable. Past Due Dividends shall be added to
the Liquidation Preference. 

   

 1.3 _Liquidation_. 

  

 (a) _Preference_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the Original 

    ##### 

  

    

Series [A] Issue Price for each share of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock
then held by them, plus the Past Due Dividends (the " _Liquidation
Preference_ ") out of any assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof
available for distribution to shareholders of the Corporation, and after
satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to creditors of the
Corporation. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the Holders shall be insufficient to permit the payment to
such holders of the full preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed to each of the Holders in proportion to the preferential amount
each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive. 

   

 (b) _Remaining Assets_. Upon the completion of the distribution required by _Section 1.3(a)_ above, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each. 

   

 1.4 _Conversion_. The Holders shall have no conversion rights with respect to such Holders shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock. 

  

 1.5 _Voting_. 

  

 (a) _General_. The Holders shall have no voting rights and their consent shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action, except as set forth in _Section 1.5(b)_ or  _Section 1.5(c)_ below or as required by the MBCL. 

   

 (b) _Class Voting Rights as to Particular Matters_. So long as any shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, the vote of or consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 

   

       | (i)  |   | the declaration or payment of any dividend
or distribution on any class or series of stock of the Corporation including
the Common Stock that ranks behind the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock
both in the priority of payment of dividends and in the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation ("
_Junior Stock_ ");  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the purchase, redemption or other acquisition for
consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, of any Junior Stock
other than in connection with the Corporations employee benefit plans,
including, without limitation, the hedging of any phantom stock or other
share equivalents issued under such employee benefit plans;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the issuance of shares of any class or series of
stock of the Corporation (other than the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred
Stock) that ranks equally with the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock both
in the priority of payment of dividends and in the distribution  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation (" _Parity Stock_ ");  
---|---|---|--- 
     | (iv)  |   | an amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision
of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws so as to adversely affect the
relative rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series [A]
Non-Voting Preferred Stock; or  
      
    | (v)  |   | the authorization of or issuance of Parity Stock
(including additional shares of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock) or
capital stock that would rank equal with or senior to the Series [A] Non-
Voting Preferred Stock.  
   

  

 (c) _Special Voting Right_. 

   

 (i) _Voting Right_. If and whenever dividends on the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal to at least three semi-annual Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (a " _Nonpayment_ "), the number of directors constituting the Board shall be increased by two, and each holder of record of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock (together with holders of any class or series of the Corporations authorized Preferred Stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Holders and the holders of any such other class or series shall not be entitled to elect such directors to the extent such election would cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporations securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors, and further provided that the Board shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director so elected is referred to as a "Preferred Stock Director." 

  

 (ii) _Election_. The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(i)_ above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20% of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20% of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Corporations principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any such other class or series of preferred stock for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_ below. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 

  

 (iii) _Notice of Special Meeting_. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporations by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after 

   ##### 

  

    

receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the
Corporation) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this _Section
1.5(c)(iii)_, and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of
the Corporation. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special
meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Corporation unless they have been previously terminated or removed
pursuant to _Section 1.5(c) (iv)_. In case any vacancy in the office of a
Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of
the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the
written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if
none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of
any other class of the Corporations authorized preferred stock having
equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) to serve until
the next annual meeting of the stockholders. 

  

 (iv) _Termination; Removal_. Whenever the Corporation has declared and paid or declared and set aside for payment in full all Past Due Dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporations authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) when they have the voting rights described in this _Section 1.5(c)_. 

  

 1.6 _Redemption_. Each share of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock is redeemable as provided in this _Section 1.6_: 

  

 (a) _Optional Redemption_. The Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time after the Original Issuance Date, at the option of the Corporation, out of funds lawfully available therefor upon giving notice of redemption pursuant to Section 6(c), at a redemption price per share equal to the applicable percentage set forth below multiplied by the sum of (a) the Liquidation Preference per share of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock plus (b) an amount per share equal to the accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the Liquidation Preference on such share of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock from and including the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the date of redemption (the " _Optional Redemption Date_ "). The following redemption prices are for shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock redeemed during the periods set forth below: 

  

       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
   Year  |   | Applicable Percentage  
     



  |   |   |   |   
  

From and including the Original Issue Date until the Mandatory Redemption
Date

  |   |   | 100  | %  
   

   

 (b) _Mandatory Redemption_. On the Mandatory Redemption Date, or, if not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter, the Corporation shall redeem the outstanding shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock out of funds lawfully available therefor at a redemption price equal to the sum of (a) the Liquidation Preference per share of the Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock plus (b) an amount per share equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously 

    ##### 

  

    

added to the Liquidation Preference on such share of Series [A] Non-Voting
Preferred Stock from and including the immediately preceding Dividend Payment
Date to but excluding the date of redemption. If the Corporation does not
have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption
Date all shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holders redeemable
shares of such capital stock out of funds legally available therefor, based
on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the
shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to
redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been
redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally
available therefor. 

   

 (c) _Redemption Notice_. Written notice of any redemption pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(a)_ shall be sent to each holder of record of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock not less than forty (40) days prior to the redemption date. The notice of redemption shall state: 

    

 (i) the number of shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption; 

   

 (ii) the redemption date and the redemption price; and 

   

 (iii) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be redeemed. 

  

 (d) _Surrender of Certificates; Payment_. On or before the Mandatory Redemption Date or the Optional Redemption Date, as the case may be, each holder of shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, and thereupon the redemption price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder. 

   

 (e) _Rights Subsequent to Redemption_. If on the applicable redemption date the redemption price payable upon redemption of the shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such redemption date is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series [A] Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such redemption date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the redemption date terminate, except only the right of the Holders to receive the redemption price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor. 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.7 _Information Rights_. Unless filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission"_ ) through EDGAR and publicly available through the EDGAR system, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to all Holders, copies of all notices, reports and other information provided to the holders of shares of Common Stock and to the holders of indebtedness under the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement") by the Corporation dated as of October 15, 2007, or any successor agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Certificate to be duly executed by its [President or Vice President] as of this ___th day of _ _, 2009.
