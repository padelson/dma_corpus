Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a &#147;<U>Notice of Disagreement</U>&#148;) to Seller prior

Entities are a key component to the success of the Seller and the Seller Entities and that the
preservation of the employee base of the Seller and the Seller Entities is critical to, among other
things, the prospects of the Seller. Consequently, Buyer agrees that, for a period of eighteen
(18)&nbsp;months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall solicit to leave employment, hire or otherwise engage (except as permitted by the Transition
Services Agreement) any individual who participated in the Business, either on a full-time or
part-time basis, or any individual with whom Buyer or its representatives had contact during the
due diligence and negotiation relating to the Acquisition, at any time between the date of the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Closing Date, or in any way interfere with the employment
relationship between the Seller and any such individual; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
(i)&nbsp;Seller agrees to negotiate in good faith with Buyer to determine whether to permit Buyer to
solicit for employment any such dedicated Business employees that Buyer identifies in writing to
Seller prior to the Closing as critical to its ongoing operation of the Business following the
Closing to the extent that such employee remains employed by Seller; (ii)&nbsp;the above restrictions on
solicitation and hiring shall not apply to any individual that has, without any solicitation or
encouragement by Buyer, terminated his or her employment with Seller or a Seller Entity, and (iii)
generalized advertisement of employment opportunities including in trade or industry publications
(if not focused specifically on or directed in any way any such individual) shall not be deemed to
cause a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions set forth herein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <U>Mutual Covenants</U>. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree as follows:

constitute an agreement to transfer or assign, directly or indirectly, any asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such asset if an attempted direct or indirect
assignment thereof, without the consent, approval or authorization (&#147;<U>Consent</U>&#148;) of a third
party, would constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention of the rights of such
third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such asset,
claim or right, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of the Seller
Entities or, upon transfer, Buyer under such asset, claim or right. If any direct or indirect
transfer or assignment by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates to Buyer, or any direct or
indirect acquisition or assumption by Buyer of, any interest in, or Liability under, any asset,
claim or right requires the Consent of a third party, then such transfer or assignment or
assumption shall be made subject to such Consent being obtained. At Buyer&#146;s written request prior
to the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for up to one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days after the
Closing in any reasonable manner (not including the payment of any consideration or the concession
of any right) in connection with Buyer&#146;s obtaining any such Consents.

take place on the terms set forth herein and then the legal interest in such Assets requiring such
Consent shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed unless and until such Consent or
waiver thereof is obtained. For one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days after the Closing, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts (not including the payment of any consideration or concession
of any right) to secure such Consent as promptly as practicable

punitive damages or lost profits in connection with any dispute between them arising out of or
relating in any way to this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or the
transactions arising hereunder or thereunder, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to
recover such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this <U>Section

competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief if such action
is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo until such time as the

from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Seller or any of its Affiliates, employees or

exemplary, indirect or punitive damages or lost profits in connection with any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to this Agreement or any of the Transition Services to be provided
