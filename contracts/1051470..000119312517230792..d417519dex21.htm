determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total dollar amount of the Disputed Items as originally submitted to the Independent
Accountant. For example, should the Disputed Items total $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Equityholders&#146; Representative&#146;s position, sixty percent (60%)&nbsp;of the costs of its review would be borne by
Buyer, and forty percent (40%)&nbsp;of the costs would be borne by the Equityholders&#146; Representative (from the Equityholders&#146; Representative Expense Funds, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;10.3(e)</U>). The Independent Accountant shall act as an
