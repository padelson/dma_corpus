provisions of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE II 
PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.1Transferred/Excluded Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities. 

 

(a)Transferred Assets. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell, assign,
transfer, convey, and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and
accept, the Transferred Assets as defined in Annex A-1, free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. Accordingly, Seller will
execute and deliver at the Closing a general assignment and bill of sale in
the form of Exhibit B (the "General Assignment Agreement"), a special warranty
deed in the form of Exhibit E (the "Deed"), and such other instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer as Buyer and Seller reasonably agree upon,
in each case, to convey to Buyer all of Seller's right, title and interest in
and to the Transferred Assets. Seller shall bear all risk of loss with
respect to the Transferred Assets (whether or not covered by insurance) up to
the time of the Closing, whereupon such risk of loss with respect to the
Transferred Assets shall pass to Buyer.

 

(b)Excluded Assets. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer is
not purchasing pursuant to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby any right, title or interest in or to any Excluded Asset
as defined in Annex A-2.

 

(c)Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities and shall agree to satisfy and discharge when due the Liabilities
of Seller and its Affiliates that are Assumed Liabilities as defined in Annex
B-1. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for the performance by Seller or
any of its Affiliates of any Assumed Liability the performance of which by, or
on behalf of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates is not accepted by the obligee in
the exercise of such obligee's lawful rights. After the Closing, Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid all Assumed Liabilities as and when such Liabilities
become due and payable. Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller at the
Closing an assumption agreement in the form of Exhibit C (the "Assumption
Agreement") and such other agreements and instruments as Seller may reasonably
request, whereby Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes to pay, perform and
discharge, as and when due, the Assumed Liabilities.

 

(d)Excluded Liabilities. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume
or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Excluded Liability
as defined in Annex B-2, all of which shall be paid by Seller when due.

 

-15-

   

(e)Transferred Assets Subject to Third Party Consent. To the extent that the
sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer or attempted sale, conveyance,
assignment or transfer to Buyer of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any
applicable Law or would require any governmental or third party Consents to be
effective and such Consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing,
this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, conveyance, assignment or
transfer, or an attempted sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer thereof.
During the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until two
hundred seventy (270) days after the Closing, (i) each of Buyer and Seller
shall provide or cause to be provided to the other party all commercially
reasonable assistance as is reasonably requested in connection with securing
such Consents, and (ii) if any Consents are not secured prior to the Closing,
pending the earlier of obtaining such Consent or the expiration of such two
hundred seventy (270) day period, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement
reasonably proposed by either Buyer or Seller under which Buyer shall obtain
the benefits, rights and obligations of use of any such Transferred Asset held
by Seller following the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall
be required to pay any consideration therefor, or to commence, defend or
participate in any Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to any third party; provided further that Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses
arising out of or relating to any Transferred Asset held by Seller for the
benefit of Buyer pursuant to any arrangement established pursuant to clause
(ii) to the extent related to any period of such arrangement. If such Consent
is obtained, Seller shall assign, convey, transfer and deliver any such
Transferred Asset to Buyer at no additional cost and for no additional
consideration. If such Consent is not obtained within two hundred seventy
(270) days after the Closing, Seller will be deemed to have fulfilled its
obligations under this Agreement and under no circumstances shall the
Consideration be reduced or Seller or its Affiliates be subject to any
Liability on account of the failure to obtain any such Consent. Subject to
Seller's compliance with this Section 2.1(e), Buyer further agrees that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement
shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to Buyer's obligations
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not
satisfied as a result of (x) the failure to obtain any such Consent or as a
result of any resulting default or termination or (y) any Proceeding commenced
or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Consent or any resulting default or termination (it
being understood that this sentence shall not be deemed to impair the rights
of Buyer in respect of any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.4).

 

(f)Buyer's Recording and Similar Responsibilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1, it shall be Buyer's responsibility
(i) to prepare the applicable Copyright assignments, Patent assignments and
Trademark assignments and to record such assignments following execution
thereof by Seller at the Closing and (ii) to bear all fees, duties and other
costs payable in connection with (A) the transfer of the Business IP and (B)
the recording and registration of title to the Transferred Assets in the name
of Buyer.

 

Section 2.2Purchase Price at Closing. 

 

(a)At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or caused to be paid on behalf of Buyer,
as consideration hereunder to Seller an amount equal to U.S.$100,000,000 (the
"Purchase Price"), which amount shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
The Purchase Price shall be paid in

 

-16-

   

immediately available funds by wire transfer in accordance with written
instructions given by Seller to Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing or such later time as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer.
Following the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be subject to further
adjustment as provided for in Section 2.3.

 

(b)On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated
Statement") setting forth a good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital as
of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), as well as
appropriate information and documentation supporting such Estimated Net
Working Capital. The Estimated Statement shall be unaudited and prepared
consistent with the Closing Account Principles. Upon delivery of the
Estimated Statement, (i) Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to
the books, records and other materials of Seller related to the Business to
the extent used in the preparation of the Estimated Statement, the personnel
of Seller who prepared the Estimated Statement and the work papers prepared by
or for Seller or any of its Representatives to the extent used in connection
with the preparation of the Estimated Statement, (ii) Buyer and Seller shall
work in good faith to resolve any objections or comments that Buyer may have
with respect to the matters set forth therein and (iii) Buyer and Seller shall
make any adjustments to such matters to the extent mutually agreed; provided,
that the Closing shall not be contingent on, or delayed by, agreement over the
Estimated Statement or calculations thereof and in the event that the parties
hereto are not able to resolve any objections or comments with respect to the
matters set forth in the Estimated Statement, then the parties shall proceed
to Closing based on the Estimated Statement prepared by Seller, adjusted to
reflect any items where the parties resolved a disagreement.

 

(c)The Purchase Price specified in Section 2.2(a) to be paid at the Closing
shall be (i) increased, if the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds
U.S.$6,000,000 (the "Net Working Capital Target"), on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount of such excess or (ii) decreased, if the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such deficit.

 

Section 2.3Purchase Price Adjustment following Closing for Net Working
Capital. 

 

(a)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (in its draft form, the "Price Adjustment
Statement") setting forth the Net Working Capital transferred to Buyer as of
the Effective Time (the "Closing Net Working Capital"), which statement shall
include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how such amount was
calculated. The Price Adjustment Statement shall be unaudited and prepared in
accordance with Seller's accounting principles set forth on Annex C (the
"Closing Account Principles"). To the extent that the Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than or less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as described in Section 2.3(f) below. The
Price Adjustment Statement shall be in the form of Schedule 2.3(a), which sets
forth an example of the calculation of Net Working Capital as of September 30,
2019.

 

(b)In connection with the preparation and review of the Price Adjustment
Statement, (i) Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assist, Seller and its Representatives in Seller's preparation of the Price
Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to Seller and its Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel,

 

-17-

   

properties, books and records of the Business in the possession of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Price
Adjustment Statement (including any taking and preparing of physical counts of
Inventory); and (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to afford to
Buyer and its Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours
to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Business in the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the
review of the Price Adjustment Statement.

 

(c)The Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the sixtieth (60th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless
Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (the "Notice of Disagreement")
to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify (i) in
reasonable detail, the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted; (ii)
disagreements with respect to (and only with respect to) (A) whether the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital was prepared in accordance with
this Section 2.3, specifically, whether the Closing Account Principles were
used, and (B) whether there were mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment
Statement; and (iii) the amount that Buyer reasonably believes is the correct
Closing Net Working Capital based on the disagreements set forth in the Notice
of Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of the
adjustments applied to the Price Adjustment Statement in calculating such
amount. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the
Price Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y)
below) shall become final, conclusive and binding upon the parties for all
purposes and in all respects on the earlier of (x) the date the parties hereto
resolve any differences they have with respect to any matter specified in the
Notice of Disagreement in a written and executed resolution (in accordance
with Section 2.3(d)) or (y) the date an independent "Big 4" accounting firm
that is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (such firm, the "Accounting
Firm") delivers its determination with respect to the Price Adjustment
Statement to the parties (in accordance with the procedure set forth in
Section 2.3(d)).

 

(d)During the thirty (30) day period immediately following the delivery of the
Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences they may have with respect to any matter specified
in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day period,
Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution by the Accounting Firm
any and all matters that were included in the Notice of Disagreement and
remain in dispute, and the Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of
the values set forth on the Price Adjustment Statement (and shall use such
determination to prepare the final Price Adjustment Statement), which
determination shall be binding on the parties; provided, however, the scope of
such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be limited solely to: (i)
those matters that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of
Disagreement (including any sub-matters subordinate to a larger included
matter), (ii) whether such calculation was prepared in accordance with this
Section 2.3 (including related definitions of defined terms used herein),
specifically, whether the Closing Account Principles were used, and (iii)
whether there were mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment Statement, and
the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any other
determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to
the accuracy of Section 5.5 or any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement or as to compliance by Seller or any of its Affiliates with any of
the covenants in this Agreement (other than this Section 2.3). The
determinations of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding, absent
fraud, bad faith or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting

 

-18-

   

Firm in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any other court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be
borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

 

(e)A party claiming that any other party has failed to comply with its
obligations under Section 2.3(b) to provide access to information may initiate
the appointment of the Accounting Firm by making a written request directly to
the mutually agreed upon Accounting Firm. If any party initiates the
appointment of the Accounting Firm under this Section 2.3(e), the Accounting
Firm shall have the authority: (i) to determine if a party has complied with
its obligations to provide access to the information required pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) and to order that a party comply with any such obligations;
(ii) to extend any deadlines set forth in this Section 2.3, including the
immediate, temporary suspension of such deadlines during the time period
necessary to resolve the disputed issue; and (iii) to allow a party the right
to amend the Price Adjustment Statement or Notice of Disagreement where it
finds that such party had been actually and materially prejudiced by the
failure to have been provided access to such information.

 

(f)If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the amount of such
excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price. If
the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Closing Net Working
Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Purchase
Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such
deficit. If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Closing
Net Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital, then there
shall be no adjustment under this Section 2.3(f) to the Purchase Price.

 

(g)No payment pursuant to this Section 2.3 need be made by either party until
the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the determination of the
final Price Adjustment Statement (the "Price Adjustment Due Date"); provided
that on or before the Price Adjustment Due Date, Buyer or Seller (or one or
more of its Affiliates as may be designated by such party) shall pay or cause
to be paid to the other party (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be
designated by such party), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
one or more bank accounts designated in writing at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Price Adjustment Due Date by the party receiving payment, cash in
dollars in an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price adjustment under
Section 2.3(f), if any, together with interest on such amount from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment, at a rate equal to the Interest Rate on the
Closing Date.

 

Section 2.4Allocation of Consideration.

 

(a)(i)Seller and Buyer shall allocate the aggregate value of all amounts
treated as the purchase price hereunder for applicable income tax purposes
(the "Tax Purchase Price") among the Transferred Assets and the covenant
contained in Section 7.8(a) in accordance with this Section 2.4 (the
"Allocation") for Tax and financial accounting purposes, subject to Section
2.4(c).

 

(ii)No later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a proposed allocation that (A) allocates the Tax
Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets and the covenant contained in
Section 7.8(a), on an asset-class-by-asset-

 

-19-

   

class basis, and (B) is in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any similar, applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Law.

 

(iii)No later than the thirtieth (30th) Business Day following Seller's
receipt of a proposed allocation pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(ii), Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, in writing, any good faith objections to such proposed
allocation. If Seller does not deliver to Buyer any such objections pursuant
to this Section 2.4(a)(iii), the allocation proposed by Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.4(a)(ii) shall become the Allocation. If Seller delivers to Buyer
any such objections pursuant to this Section 2.4(a)(iii):

 

(A)Buyer and Seller shall negotiate with one another in good faith to agree,
within thirty (30) Business Days, upon an allocation that is in accordance
with Section 2.4(a)(ii), and any such allocation agreed upon by the parties in
writing shall become the Allocation; and

 

(B)if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon an allocation pursuant to
clause (A) above, then (1) the parties hereto shall prepare a written schedule
of the portions of a proposed allocation of the Tax Purchase Price that they
have agreed upon to date, if any, which schedule shall be final and binding on
the parties and (2) subject to Section 2.4(c), and to the extent not
inconsistent with the schedule described in clause (1), if applicable, each
party hereto shall be entitled to use its own allocation of the Tax Purchase
Price as such party deems appropriate.

 

(b)The parties (i) shall mutually amend the Allocation (and the schedule
described in Section 2.4(a)(iii)(B)(1), if applicable) to reflect (A) any
payments made pursuant to Section 2.3 and (B) the Net Working Capital set
forth in the Price Adjustment Statement finalized pursuant to Section 2.3 and
(ii) may amend the Allocation (and the schedule described in Section
2.4(a)(iii)(B)(1), if applicable) to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase
Price under this Agreement for Tax purposes not described in clause (i) in a
manner reasonably consistent with the circumstances giving rise to such
payments or adjustments (as applicable).

 

(c)Except as required by applicable Law, (i) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Affiliates to, (A) act in accordance with the
Allocation (and the schedule described in Section 2.4(a)(iii)(B)(1), if
applicable) for all Tax purposes, including with respect to any forms or
reports (including IRS Form 8594) filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code,
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar, applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Law, (B) cooperate in the preparation of
any such forms or reports and (C) timely file such forms or reports in the
manner required by applicable Law and (ii) Seller and Buyer shall not, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, take any position that
is inconsistent with either the Allocation or the schedule described in
Section 2.4(a)(iii)(B)(1), if applicable, in any communication (whether
written or unwritten) with any Governmental Authority; provided, however, that
this Section 2.4(c) shall not require Seller or Buyer or any of their
Affiliates to litigate before any court, or prevent any of them from settling
in good faith, any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Authority challenging the Allocation or the schedule described in Section
2.4(a)(iii)(B)(1), if applicable.

 

-20-

   

Section 2.5Withholding. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold any Taxes from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements any Taxes required to be withheld and deducted under
applicable Law, provided that prior to deduction or withholding of any such
amount (excluding for this purpose any payments of a compensatory nature made
in connection with the performance of services), Buyer and its Affiliates
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least five (5)
Business Days' advance written notice to Seller and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with any reasonable request by Seller to
reduce or eliminate the obligation to withhold. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld and duly and timely deposited with the appropriate
Governmental Authority by Buyer, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or materially
impair, prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it is or will be a party or
the consummation of the Acquisition.

Guarantor, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,

Environmental Law for Buyer to own or operate the Business or the Transferred
Assets ("Environmental Permits"). If any such Environmental Permits are not

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in any lawful and
reasonable arrangement under which Buyer obtains the benefit of the

days after the Closing. In the event that the Permit Expiration Date is
extended pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and Seller
shall continue to use commercially

 

-40-

Act, and (ii) all other necessary registrations, declarations, notices and
filings relating to the Acquisition with any Governmental Authority with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Competition Laws
("Governmental Competition Authority") with respect to the Acquisition and to
respond to any inquiries received and supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other Competition Law. From and after the date hereof
and until all governmental approvals required in connection with the
Acquisition have been obtained, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, operate its business in such manner or take any action,
that could reasonably be expected to significantly increase the risk of not
obtaining any such governmental approval or clearance or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period.

 

(b)Each of Seller and Buyer shall (i) keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall comply
with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, (ii) cooperate
and consult with each other in connection with the making of all filings,
notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 7.4,
including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
written communication to any Governmental Competition Authority, (iii) provide
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by
such party and all correspondence and other written communications between
such party (and its advisors) and any Governmental Competition Authority and
any other information supplied by such party or its Affiliates to a
Governmental Competition Authority or received from such a Governmental
Competition Authority in connection with the Acquisition; provided, however,
that materials may be redacted before being provided to the other party as
necessary to (x) comply with contractual arrangements or (y) address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (iv) furnish to the
other party such information and assistance as such party reasonably may
request in connection with the preparation of any submissions to, or agency
Proceedings by, any Governmental Competition Authority. Upon and subject to
the terms of this Section 7.4, each party agrees to cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts to assist in any defense by any other party to the
Acquisition before any Governmental Competition Authority reviewing the
Acquisition, including by providing as promptly as practicable such
information as may be requested by such Governmental Competition Authority or
such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other party to this
Agreement in such defense.

 

(c)If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Competition Authority
with respect to the Acquisition under any applicable Competition Law or which
would otherwise

 

-41-

   

prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Acquisition, or if any Proceeding is instituted by any Governmental
Competition Authority or any private party challenging the Acquisition as
violative of any applicable Competition Law, or an Order is issued enjoining
the Acquisition, each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or Proceedings so as to permit
consummation of the Acquisition by the Closing as soon as practicable. In the
event that any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Competition Authority or private party challenging the
Acquisition, each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such Proceeding, including defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the Acquisition.

 

(d)Each of Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
applicable Competition Law as soon as practicable. Seller and Buyer shall not
extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or to not
consummate the Acquisition on the Closing Date, except with the prior written
consent of the other party to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and Buyer shall not have any
substantive contact with any Governmental Competition Authority in respect of
any filing or Proceeding contemplated by this Section 7.4 unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Competition Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to
participate.

 

(e)Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action necessary to avoid
and eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law,
so as to enable the consummation of the Acquisition as soon as practicable,
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of the respective businesses, product lines or
assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Assets) and (ii)
otherwise using reasonable best efforts to take or commit to take actions that
after consummation of the Acquisition would limit Buyer's or its Affiliates'
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Assets); provided, that none of the CVC Persons or any
portfolio company in which any CVC Person is invested (other than Buyer,
Affiliate Guarantor or any subsidiary of Affiliate Guarantor that owns a
composites business) shall be required to take or agree to take any actions
described in this Section 7.4(e).

 

(f)With respect to the matters covered in this Section 7.4, it is agreed that
Buyer shall make all strategic decisions and lead all discussions,
negotiations and other proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect
to any requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings,
approvals, or waivers that may be sought by or from, any Governmental
Competition Authority, including determining the strategy for contesting,
litigating or otherwise responding to objections to, or Proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case subject to good faith consultations with Seller.

Section 7.5Access Post-Closing. Following the Closing, Buyer will permit
Seller and its duly authorized Representatives access during normal business
hours (upon reasonable advance notice to Buyer of not less than two (2)
Business Days) to all Contracts, books, records and other data to the extent
relating to the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities conveyed and
assumed at the Closing to the extent that such materials were delivered to
Buyer to the extent required for Tax or accounting purposes; provided, that
such access would not (a) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Buyer,
its Affiliates or the Business, (b) include access to any Contracts, books,
records, document, communication other data or materials that would reasonably
be expected to be protected by any attorney-client, work product or similar
legal privilege, (c) based on Buyer's good faith belief, on the advice of
legal counsel, reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law or any
contractual confidentiality obligations, or (d) require Buyer to provide
access to any books, records or other information of Buyer and its Affiliates
that are not related to the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities.
Seller agrees that after the Closing, Buyer or its authorized Representatives
may, at Buyer's cost and expense, make copies of those books and records (or
redacted portions thereof) of Seller (other than the Excluded Assets) that
have not been transferred to Buyer and relate to the Business. Seller will
keep any information obtained under this Section 7.5 confidential other than
with the consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the case of clauses (b) and (c), Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such access as can be provided (or otherwise find
alternative means to convey such information regarding the applicable matters
as can be conveyed) without violating or waiving such Law, contractual
obligation or privilege.

 

Section 7.6Non-competition; Non-solicitation. 

 

(a)Seller understands that Buyer shall be entitled to protect and preserve the
going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by Law and that
Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this
Section 7.6. Therefore, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.6(a),
Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any controlled Affiliate of Seller shall engage in any
business, the primary activity of which is to compete with the Business in the
United States (each, a "Competitive Activity"); provided, however, that it
shall not be deemed to be a violation of this subsection for Seller or any of
its Affiliates:

 

(i)to invest in any Person which invests in, manages or operates a Competitive
Activity, so long as Seller's or its Affiliates' investment is less than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding ownership interests in such
Person and Seller does not control such Person or Competitive Activity;

 

(ii)to acquire a Competitive Activity (or a third party engaging in such
Competitive Activity) by merger or a purchase of the equity interests or
assets of a third party so long as the annual Operating Income of such third
party attributable to such Competitive Activity for the most recent fiscal
year of such third party preceding the acquisition does not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the aggregate annual Operating Income during such period for
all of the businesses or operations acquired from such third party; provided,
however, that in the event of any such acquisition where the aggregate annual
Operating Income related to the Competitive Activity exceeds twenty-five
percent (25%) of such aggregate annual Operating Income, Seller

 

-43-

   

shall be required to attempt to divest such excess portion of the Competitive
Activity at such price and on such terms as Seller deems commercially
reasonable. Seller shall not be required to divest such Competitive Activity
at a loss, or be required to discontinue operation of such Competitive
Activity in order to comply with this Section 7.6;

 

(iii)to own any securities through any employee benefit plan;

 

(iv)to perform any Competitive Activity for the benefit of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including the performance of any Competitive Activity expressly
required by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or

 

(v)to engage in any business (other than the Business) conducted by Seller or
its Affiliates at Closing.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing covenant shall not
apply with respect to any Person or its Affiliates that acquires an interest
in all or any portion of the equity interests or assets of Seller or any of
its Affiliates and whether or not prior to such acquisition such Person or its
Affiliates were already engaged in a Competitive Activity.

 

(c)From and after the Closing for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing, Seller agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates will, without
Buyer's prior written consent, directly or indirectly (including through
Seller's or its Affiliates' Representatives), solicit for employment (whether
as an employee, consultant or temporary employee) any Transferred Employee,
except that this paragraph shall not preclude Seller or any other person from
entering into discussions with or soliciting any person (i) who responds to
any public advertisement or general solicitation, (ii) who initiates
discussions with the soliciting party regarding such employment on his or her
own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation by the
soliciting party, its Representatives or its Affiliates or (iii) has been
terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates at least three (3) months prior to
commencement of discussions with the soliciting party.

 

(d)From and after the Closing for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing, Buyer agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates will, without
Seller's prior written consent, directly or indirectly (including through
Buyer's or its Affiliates' Representatives), solicit for employment (whether
as an officer, director, employee, consultant or temporary employee) any
officer, director or employee of Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates, except
that this paragraph shall not preclude Buyer or any other person from entering
into discussions with or soliciting any person (i) who responds to any public
advertisement or general solicitation, (ii) who initiates discussions with the
soliciting party regarding such employment on his or her own initiative and
without any direct or indirect solicitation by the soliciting party, its
Representatives or its Affiliates or (iii) has been terminated by Seller or
its Affiliates at least three (3) months prior to commencement of discussions
with the soliciting party.

 

(e)For purposes of this Section 7.6, "Operating Income" shall mean earnings
before interest, income Taxes and extraordinary items, all calculated and
determined in accordance with GAAP.

 

-44-

   

Section 7.7Further Assurances. 

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, and from time to time at the request of
the other party, each of Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates
shall, without further consideration, execute and deliver such instruments of
transfer, conveyance, assignment and assumption, in addition to the Ancillary
Agreements, and take such other action as may reasonably be necessary to
consummate the Acquisition or to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by the Ancillary Agreements.

 

(b)If any Transferred Asset is damaged by fire or other casualty occurring
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the parties shall nonetheless
consummate the Acquisition, without any Liability on the part of Seller by
reason of such casualty; provided, that such fire or casualty, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Seller shall, on the Closing Date, (i) assign and remit to Buyer,
without representation, warranty or recourse, and Buyer shall be entitled to
receive and keep, the net proceeds of any award or other proceeds under any
relevant insurance policy which may have been collected by Seller as a result
of such casualty less the reasonable expenses incurred by Seller and its
Affiliates in obtaining such award or proceeds and in actually repairing or
restoring such Transferred Asset, or (ii) if no award or other proceeds shall
have been collected, deliver to Buyer an assignment of Seller's right to any
such award or other proceeds which may be payable to it as a result of such
casualty without representation, warranty or recourse.

 

(c)Subject in all respects to Section 2.1(e), in the event that at any time or
from time to time after the Closing, Seller receives or otherwise possesses
any Transferred Asset that should belong to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
Seller shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to
Buyer or its designee, for no additional consideration and net of Seller's
out-of-pocket costs to effectuate such transfer. Prior to any such transfer,
Seller shall hold such asset in trust for the benefit of Buyer. In the event
that at any time or from time to time after the Closing, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives or otherwise possesses any Excluded Asset that should
belong to Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or
cause to be transferred, such asset to Seller or its designee, for no
consideration and net of Buyer's out-of-pocket costs to effectuate such
transfer. Prior to any such transfer, Buyer shall hold such asset in trust
for the benefit of Seller.

 

Section 7.8Adjustments and True-Ups. 

 

(a)To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other, receives any payment after the
Closing to which the other party is entitled pursuant to the terms hereof,
each of Buyer and Seller agrees to promptly remit the proceeds (net of any
expenses, including Taxes, incurred upon receipt of such payment or remitting
such proceeds) to the other party, as appropriate, and makes a payment to a
third party on behalf of and at the express written direction of the other
party, the other party agrees to promptly reimburse Seller or Buyer (inclusive
of any expenses, including Taxes, incurred by Seller or Buyer upon making such
payment or receiving such reimbursement), as applicable, for such payment.

 

-45-

   

(b)The parties acknowledge and agree that there is no right of offset
regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received from third
parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a dispute
regarding any other issue under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

(c)The provisions of this Section 7.8 shall not apply with respect to Tax
payments that are governed by Article IX hereof.

 

Section 7.9Replacement of Credit Support Obligations. 

 

(a)Buyer recognizes that Seller and certain of its Affiliates and third
parties have provided credit support to the Business or the Transferred Assets
pursuant to the Credit Support Obligations set forth on Schedule 7.9(a) and
that Seller may supplement the Credit Support Obligations listed on Schedule
7.9(a) from time to time prior to Closing to the extent such supplement does
not materially increase the total amount of such obligation and is entered
into in the ordinary course of the Business and consistent with past practice.
Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, from and after the
date hereof, Seller shall not be permitted to enter into any additional Credit
Support Obligations without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 

(b)With respect to the Credit Support Obligations set forth on Schedule
7.9(a), on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide replacement guarantees, letters of credit,
surety bonds or other assurances of payment for each such Credit Support
Obligation to the extent such replacements are required by the applicable
counterparty, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the respective
banks or other counterparties, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to obtain
any necessary release in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
and Seller with respect to all such Credit Support Obligations; provided, that
the replacement Buyer is required to provide does not have to take the form of
a letter of credit or bond unless the existing Credit Support Obligation is in
such form.

 

(c)If Buyer is not successful, for any reason, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from any Credit Support
Obligation set forth on Schedule 7.9(a) by the Closing Date or noticed to
Buyer after the Closing as provided in this Section 7.9(c) (each such Credit
Support Obligation, until such time as such Credit Support Obligation is
released in accordance with Section 7.9(b), a "Continuing Credit Support
Obligation"), then:

 

(i)Buyer shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
promptly the complete and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates
from each Continuing Credit Support Obligation until such release is obtained;
and

 

(ii)Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any demand or draw
upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Credit Support Obligation or any cash
or other collateral posted by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with or
in the place of any such Continuing Credit Support Obligation and for the
carrying costs of any cash collateral not replaced by Buyer, the fronting fee
costs, and any other out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses resulting
from each such Continuing Credit Support Obligation.

 

-46-

   

Section 7.10No Use of Seller Retained Names.

 

(a)On and after the Closing Date, except as expressly provided in this Section
7.10, none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall use the "Ashland" name or
any marks, domain names and logos or other name(s) or identifier(s)
confusingly similar thereto (or any derivations therefrom in any language)
(the "Retained Names") alone or together with other words, or logos, slogans,
symbols or designs in any form, variation or manner that is confusingly
similar to the Retained Names in connection with any business that Buyer or
its Affiliates may thereafter conduct.

 

(b)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Buyer may continue to distribute
product literature that uses any Retained Names and distribute products with
labeling or packaging that uses any Retained Names to the extent that such
product literature and labeling or packaging exists on the Closing Date;
provided that Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, within such
ninety (90) day period: (i) revise print advertising, product labeling and all
other information or other materials, including any internet or other
electronic communication vehicles, change signage and stationery, (ii) display
a notice, in a format reasonably acceptable to Seller, indicating the Business
(A) was formerly owned by Seller, and (B) is now owned by Buyer and (iii)
discontinue use of the Retained Names. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that upon
the termination of the ninety (90) day period, Buyer shall have no right to
use the Retained Names for any purpose. In no event shall Buyer or any of its
Affiliates use any Retained Names after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose different from the use of such Retained Names by Seller prior to the
Closing. Subject to the above, with respect to the Inventory, Buyer may
continue to sell such Inventory, notwithstanding that it or its labeling or
packaging bears one or more of the Retained Names, for a reasonable time after
the Closing (not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days). Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall not be obligated
to remove or otherwise obliterate the Retained Names from any Business books
and records or archived materials, or any equipment, tools,
engineering/manufacturing drawings, manuals, work sheets, operating
procedures, other similar written or electronic data, materials or assets, in
each case, that are used only for internal purposes in connection with the
Business. Subject to Section 7.10(c), Buyer shall not be restricted from using
the Retained Names in a non-trademark manner in text that is factual, accurate
and non-prominent for purposes of conveying to customers or the general public
that the Business is no longer affiliated with Seller or its Affiliates and/or
to make historical reference to the Business, in each case after the Closing.
All usage of Retained Names set forth under this Section 7.10(b) shall be only
with respect to goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater
than the quality of goods and services with respect to which the Retained
Names were used in the Business prior to the Closing, and in no case in any
manner that may damage or tarnish the reputation of Seller or the goodwill
associated with the Retained Names or Seller's ownership of the Retained
Names. After the periods set forth above, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
immediately cease using the Retained Names.

 

(c)Except for the rights expressly provided under Section 7.10(b), no other
right to use the Retained Names is granted hereunder by Seller whether by
implication or otherwise, and nothing hereunder permits Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to use the Retained Names. Each of Buyer and its Affiliates further
acknowledges that none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates is acquiring any
right to use the Retained Names, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
contest the ownership or validity of any of the Retained Names. Buyer hereby
acknowledges that all right,

 

-47-

   

title and interest in and to the Retained Names are owned exclusively by
Seller or its Affiliates, and except as expressly set forth above under
Section 7.10(b), any and all right of the Business to use the Retained Names
shall immediately revert to Seller, along with any and all goodwill associated
therewith. All goodwill generated by the use of the Retained Names under
Section 7.10(b) shall inure solely to the benefit of Seller or its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.11Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall amend or take such other action with respect to the TAA
and the Securitization Sale Agreement (collectively, the "Securitization
Facility") to permit all Accounts Receivable of the Business covered by the
Securitization Facility to be transferred to Buyer at Closing free and clear
of all Encumbrances. At the Closing, Seller will transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to Buyer all Accounts Receivable of the Business covered by the
Securitization Facility free and clear of all Encumbrances.

 

Section 7.12RandW Insurance Policy. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the RandW Insurance Policy to be bound as of the Closing. Each
of the parties agree that the RandW Insurance Policy shall provide that the
Insurer shall only be entitled to exercise rights of subrogation against
Seller in the case of Claims of Fraud. Seller shall be an express third party
beneficiary of such provision and shall be entitled to enforce such provision
as if Seller were a party thereto. Such provision may not be amended without
the written consent of Seller. Seller shall execute and deliver all
documents, instruments, certificates and other writings reasonably required to
be executed and delivered by Seller under the RandW Insurance Policy at or prior
to the Closing, each in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller,
including to the extent required to satisfy any conditions to the
effectiveness thereof or the coverage to be provided thereby.

 

Section 7.13Insurance Coverage. From and after the Closing Date (a) the
Business shall cease to be insured by, have access or availability to, be
entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits or seek coverage
under, any of Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies or any of their
self-insured programs and (b) Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining
or providing insurance coverage for the Business for any event or occurrence
after the Closing; provided that, from and after the Closing, if any claims
are made or damages occur or are suffered prior to the Closing Date that
relate to the Business, and such claims, or claims associated with such
damages, may be made against such insurance policies, then Seller shall use
(and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to use) its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that, after the Closing Date, Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate, can file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue such claims and
recover proceeds under the terms of such policies, and Seller agrees to (and
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to) otherwise cooperate in good faith
with Buyer or its Affiliates to make the benefits and proceeds of any such
insurance policies available to Buyer or its Affiliates, at the sole cost and
expense of Buyer or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set
forth in the foregoing proviso, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all
rights to control their insurance policies and programs, including the right
to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes
with respect to any of its insurance policies and programs.

 

Section 7.14Confidentiality. Seller agrees that, for a period of four (4)
years from and after the Closing, it shall and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to (a) treat and hold as
confidential all of the Confidential Information of Buyer and (b) refrain

 

-48-

   

from duplicating, disclosing or using any of such Confidential Information;
provided, however, that notwithstanding this Section 7.14(b), Confidential
Information related both to the Business and Seller's retained businesses
shall be treated by Seller as Seller treats its own confidential information.
In the event that Seller or any of its Representatives is required by
applicable Law or compelled by judicial or administrative process to disclose
any Confidential Information, Seller shall first, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, notify Buyer promptly of such requirement and reasonably
cooperate with Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
confidential treatment at Buyer's sole expense. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller or its
Representative is, on the reasonable advice of legal counsel, required by
applicable Law or compelled by applicable judicial or administrative process
to disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority, Seller
or its Representative may disclose only such portion of the Confidential
Information to such Governmental Authority as is so required; provided,
however, that Seller and its Representatives shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be so
disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these confidentiality obligations
shall remain in effect after the Closing for Confidential Information that is
Trade Secret for as long as such Confidential Information remains protected
under any applicable Laws. 

 

Section 7.15Provision of Business Data; Cooperation. Seller shall use best
efforts to deliver to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days (but in no event
later than fifteen (15) Business Days) after the date hereof the information
set forth on Schedule 7.15(a) (the "Business Data"). Seller will use best
efforts to provide the Business Data in any format reasonably requested by
Buyer. Buyer will use the Business Data to develop and construct its
information technology system so that Buyer can sell products, fulfill orders
and otherwise operate the Business in substantially the same manner as
currently conducted from the day following the Closing Date. After the date
hereof, Buyer shall use its best efforts to develop and construct its
information technology system so that the parties may close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the original
Inside Date. From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Seller agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and provide such
assistance, information and access to the Transferred Real Property, the
Employees at the Transferred Real Property and information technology
equipment located at the Transferred Real Property to Buyer as is reasonably
necessary for Buyer to establish standalone operations as of the Closing Date
such that Buyer can operate the Business in substantially the same manner as
currently conducted from the day following the Closing Date, including as set
forth on Schedule 7.15(b); provided, however, that no such access (or related
activities or investigations) shall unreasonably interfere with Seller's or
its Affiliates' normal operations of their businesses, including the Business;
provided, further, that all information received by Buyer or its
Representatives and given by or on behalf of Seller in connection with this
Section 7.15 will be held by Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives as
confidential information pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement; and provided, further, that Buyer agrees to comply fully with all
rules, regulations and instructions issued by Seller regarding Buyer's or its
Representatives' actions while upon, entering or leaving the Transferred Real
Property.

ARTICLE VIII 
CERTAIN EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 8.1Employees. Schedule 8.1 lists, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each employee as of the date hereof who is charged exclusively
to a Business cost center and certain employees charged primarily to a
Business cost center (each such individual, an "Employee"), by identification
number and such Employee's title, work location, employer, union status, if
any, annual salary or base rate, exempt/non-exempt status, and active/inactive
status, if any. Seller shall deliver an update of such Schedule 8.1 at the
Closing, provided that such update shall include the names of such individuals
and any changes to the information provided as of the date hereof, including
with respect to each Employee's active/inactive status.

 

Section 8.2Offers of Employment. Buyer shall make an offer of employment to
all active Employees in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII,
at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (or such longer period
required to avoid contractual or other severance obligations, including any
compensation or benefits payable during a termination notice period), with
such employment to be effective as of the Closing. Any such offer of
employment shall (a) be for a position that is comparable to the type of
position held, with respect to both job level and duties, by such Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (b) be at a geographic location that is
within the greater of (i) fifty (50) straight-line miles of the Employee's
home or (ii) the distance from the Employee's home and place of work
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (c) provide an annual base salary
or wage rage and an annual incentive compensation opportunity (which for the
avoidance of doubt, does not include any equity-based compensation) which is
not less favorable than that received by Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (d) be contingent on such offered Employee being designated
as "active" on Schedule 8.1 at the Closing. Each such Employee who accepts
such offer of employment from Buyer is referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee"; provided, that Transferred Employees shall not include any
Employees that are designated as "inactive" on Schedule 8.1 at the Closing.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article VIII or to the
extent required by applicable Law, effective as of the Effective Time, the
Transferred Employees shall cease all active participation in and accrual of
benefits under the Employee Benefit Plans. With respect to Employees who are
designated as "inactive" on Schedule 8.1 at the Closing (referred to herein as
an "Inactive Employee"), Buyer shall be required to offer employment to such
Inactive Employee, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII,
effective as of the date such Inactive Employee notifies Buyer in writing that
such individual has returned to active status. In the case of any such
Inactive Employee who accepts such offer of employment, (x) such Employee
shall become a Transferred Employee as of the date such Employee presents
himself or herself to Buyer for active employment, (y) except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, all references in this Agreement to the Closing, the Closing Date
and the Effective Time shall instead be deemed to refer to the date such
Employee becomes a Transferred Employee, and (z) Buyer shall have no
obligation to provide compensation and benefits to each such Employee until
the date he or she becomes a Transferred Employee.

 

Section 8.3Continuation of Compensation and Benefits. For a period of
eighteen (18) months immediately after the Closing Date (or for such longer
period as required by the terms of any applicable Union Contract), Buyer shall
provide to each Transferred Employee (a) a base salary or wages no less
favorable than those provided by Seller to such Transferred Employee as

 

-50-

   

in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (b) other employee
benefits, including variable pay and incentive or bonus opportunities, under
plans, programs and arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided by Seller to such Transferred Employee as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.4Severance Obligations. 

 

(a)Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
Acquisition and that the Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted
employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the
same. Buyer shall bear any costs related to, and shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Seller from and against, (i) any claims made by any Employee for
any statutory, contractual or common law severance or separation benefits and
other legally mandated payment obligations (including the employer portion of
any employment Taxes, together with any compensation payable during any
mandatory termination notice period related thereto), in each case, arising
out of or in connection with the failure of Buyer to make offers of employment
to, or continue the employment of, any Employee in accordance with this
Agreement, and (ii) any claims relating to the employment of any Transferred
Employee on or after the Closing Date, including in respect of any act or
omission relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee on or after
the Closing Date; provided, that prior to Closing, Seller will not, without
first obtaining Buyer's written consent, discuss (x) Buyer's offer and
acceptance process, or (y) future employment with, or provision of services
to, Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, but not limited to, providing
any Employee with a competing offer or incentive), in each case, in any way
with any individual who has been listed on Schedule 8.1.

 

(b)Buyer shall provide each Transferred Employee whose employment is
terminated within eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (or within
such longer period as required by the terms of any applicable Union Contract)
with severance and other separation benefits substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the severance and other separation benefits provided to such
Transferred Employee by Seller as in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 

Section 8.5Allocation of Employment Liabilities. 

 

(a)Except with respect to any Liabilities that transfer to Buyer pursuant to
applicable Law or as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Seller
shall retain Liability and responsibility for all employment and employee
benefit-related Liabilities, claims or Losses that arise as a result of an
event or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time that relate to the
Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Employee). Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, effective as of the
Effective Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall assume and be solely responsible
for all employment and employee benefit-related Liabilities, claims or Losses
that relate to any Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of
any Transferred Employee) that arise as a result of an event or events that
occurred on or after the Effective Time or are otherwise expressly assumed by
Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

 

-51-

   

(b)Seller shall retain all Liabilities for all workers' compensation, short-
and long-term disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims
incurred by Employees prior to the Effective Time that are covered under the
terms of the applicable plans of Seller or its Affiliates. With respect to
claims incurred on or after the Effective Time by the Transferred Employees
and their eligible dependents for workers' compensation, short- and long-term
disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims, Buyer or
its Affiliates shall be responsible. For these purposes, a claim shall be
deemed to be incurred: (i) in the case of short- or long-term disability
benefits (including related health benefits), at the time of the injury,
sickness or other event giving rise to the claim for such benefits, (ii) in
the case of workers' compensation benefits, when the event giving rise to the
claim ("Workers' Compensation Event") occurs, (iii) in the case of medical,
prescription drug, dental or vision benefits, at the time professional
services, equipment or prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are
obtained, (iv) in the case of life insurance benefits, upon death and (v) in
the case of accidental death and dismemberment benefits, at the time of the
accident. If the Workers' Compensation Event occurs over a period both
preceding and following the Effective Time, the claim shall be the joint
Liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, and shall
be equitably apportioned between such parties based upon the relative periods
of time that the Workers' Compensation Event transpired preceding and
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 8.6Service Credit. Effective from and after the Effective Time, Buyer
shall (a) recognize, for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and accruals, but other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan) under all plans, programs and arrangements established
or maintained by Buyer for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, service
with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the extent such
service was recognized under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan covering
such Transferred Employees, (b) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and

of the Transferred Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual

similar payments made or incurred prior to the Closing Date for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs.

Section 8.8Bonuses; Retention. 

 

(a)Seller shall retain all Liabilities with respect to the Transferred
Employees under any annual incentive or short-term bonus plans sponsored or
maintained by Seller or any of its subsidiaries that accrues in the period
prior to the Closing Date and, notwithstanding the terms and conditions of
such plans, shall pay to each Transferred Employee that participates in any
such plan an amount equal to the amount such Transferred Employee would have
been eligible to receive for the applicable period in which the Closing Date
occurs had such Transferred Employee remained an employee of Seller or its
subsidiaries through the requisite date of eligibility in the plan, calculated
as though applicable goals and conditions were achieved at one hundred percent
(100%) of target performance levels, and then pro-rated based upon the period
of time that transpired preceding the Closing Date. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make the payments described in this Section
8.8(a) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date.
Following the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall participate in
annual incentive or short-term bonus plans sponsored or maintained by Buyer.

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller wishes for Buyer to make the
payments described in Section 8.8(a) (in lieu of such payments being made by
Seller), then Seller shall provide Buyer with (i) a schedule of such payments
to be made to the Transferred Employees (the "Bonus Payment Schedule"), and
(ii) the aggregate amount of payment set forth on the Bonus Payment Schedule,
and upon receipt, Buyer shall make such payments, within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the funds, in accordance with the Bonus Payment Schedule acting as
agent on Seller's behalf. Following the date on which all such payments have
been made, Buyer shall provide Seller with a schedule that sets forth the name
and identification number of each Transferred Employee who received a payment
and the amount thereof; provided that all such names, identification numbers
and payment amounts must be in accordance with the Bonus Payment Schedule.

 

(c)Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the Liabilities set
forth on Schedule 8.8(c) with respect to the individual retention letter
agreement with a Transferred Employee set forth on Schedule 8.8(c). From and
after Closing, Buyer shall maintain such individual retention letter agreement
pursuant to its terms in effect as of the Closing, and the Parties shall make
payments in respect of their assumed Liabilities to the Transferred Employee
at the times prescribed thereunder (including, where applicable, upon the
occurrence of the Closing) as set forth on Schedule 8.8(c).

 

Section 8.9401(k) Plan. If Buyer maintains or establishes a defined
contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code ("Buyer's 401(k) Plan"),
Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee participating in Seller's 401(k)
Plan to effect, and Buyer agrees to cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept, in
accordance with applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including
earnings thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing
all outstanding loans) under Seller's 401(k) Plan if such rollover to Buyer's
401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred
Employee, subject to each of Seller's and Buyer's reasonable satisfaction that
Seller's 401(k) Plan or Buyer's 401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in compliance
with all applicable Laws and that such plan continues to satisfy the
requirements for a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that
the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt from Tax under Section
501(a) of the Code. Upon

 

-53-

   

completion of a direct rollover of a Transferred Employee's account balances,
as described in this Section 8.9, Buyer and Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall be fully
responsible for all benefits relating to past service of such Transferred
Employee and none of Seller and Seller's 401(k) Plan shall have any Liability
whatsoever with respect to such benefits.

 

Section 8.10WARN Act. Buyer agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to
provide, any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 and any similar federal, state or local Law or
regulation ("WARN"), and to otherwise comply with WARN and any other similar
Law or regulation, in each case with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as defined in WARN) or group termination or similar event affecting
Employees (including as a result of the Acquisition) and occurring on and
after the Effective Time. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall take
any action before or after the Closing that would cause any termination of
employment of any Employees that occurs before the Effective Time to
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group termination under WARN,
or to create any Liability or penalty to Seller for any employment
terminations under applicable Law; provided, that upon Closing, Seller has
provided Buyer with (a) a true and complete list of all Employees who
experience an "employment losses" (as defined in WARN) occurring within ninety
(90) days prior to Closing (by employment site, date of employment loss, and
reason for employment loss), (b) a true and complete list of all Employees who
have been subject to temporary layoff (by employment site, date of such
layoff, and expected return date), and (c) a true and complete list of all
Employees whose hours have been reduced by more than 50% (by employment site
and date of such reduction).

 

Section 8.11Union Contracts. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize as exclusive bargaining
representatives the unions identified in the Union Contracts listed in
Schedule 5.17(b)(i) (the "Current Unions"), such Union Contracts currently
applicable to Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date, and bargain with
the Current Unions in good faith regarding the terms and conditions of
employment of such Transferred Employees, as required by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.12Employee Records. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to
Buyer copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee to the
extent permitted to be provided to Buyer under applicable Law. Buyer shall
ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the employment
of such Transferred Employee and shall keep such employment records
confidential, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and
against any statutory, common Law or other claims that arise from the use of
such employment records other than for employment, compensation or
termination-related purposes.

 

Section 8.13No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article VIII
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this Article VIII, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement. Nothing in this Article VIII, express or implied, shall
be (a) deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to any Employee, or
(b) construed to prevent Buyer from terminating or modifying to any extent or
in any respect any benefit plan that Buyer may establish or maintain.

Section 9.7Tax Returns. 

 

(a)(i) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Seller-Signed Tax Returns in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities and (ii) for any Seller-Signed Tax Return for which there would be
a reasonable expectation either that Buyer would have a Liability (for which

survive the Closing) or that such Seller-Signed Tax Return would be binding on
Buyer in any Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller (x) shall provide Buyer with a

Business Days before such due date and (iv) shall not, and shall cause its

such due date, of its objection to the filing of such Tax Return.

 

(c)Each Transfer Tax Return shall be prepared and filed, or caused to be
prepared and filed, in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental

relevant Governmental Authority the amount, if any, shown as due on such Tax
Return; provided that if the Tax Return Filer is not permitted to make such
payment under applicable Law, then the parties shall cooperate in good faith
to arrange for such amount to be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority
in a manner permitted by applicable Law; provided further that the obligation
to make payments pursuant to this Section 9.7(e)(i) shall not affect such Tax

otherwise be indemnified under this Agreement with respect to any Taxes.

 

(ii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, on or before the due date of any

liable for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (an "Applicable Tax Contest"); provided,

Tax Contest shall reduce or otherwise affect the indemnification obligations
of Seller hereunder except to the extent the defense of such Applicable Tax
Contest is prejudiced thereby.

 

(b)Subject to Section 9.8(c), Seller shall have the exclusive right to control
the conduct and settlement of all Applicable Tax Contests relating to Taxes
for which Seller could be solely liable under Section 9.1 if a claim for such
Taxes were made. Each party that controls the conduct of an Applicable Tax
Contest pursuant to this Section 9.8(b) shall keep the other party informed of
the status of, and any developments in, such Applicable Tax Contest. Neither
party shall enter into (or agree to enter into) any compromise or settlement

other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

refund, arising in connection with Taxes borne by the other party (either by
payment to a Taxing Authority, because of its inclusion in the calculation of
Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3, or by the
making of an indemnity payment under Section 9.1) (a "Refund Recipient") shall
pay to the other party the entire amount of such refund, credit, or offset,
including any interest from, but net of any Taxes imposed by, a Taxing
Authority with respect to such refund, credit, or offset (i) in the case of a
refund, no more than thirty (30) Business Days after receiving such refund and
(ii) in the case of a credit or offset, no more than thirty (30) Business Days
after the filing of the Tax Return utilizing such credit or offset; provided
that if such Refund Recipient is required to repay to the relevant Taxing

 

-58-

   

Authority such refund, credit or offset, the other party shall, upon the
request of such Refund Recipient, repay the amount previously paid to such
other party pursuant to this Section 9.9(a) in respect of such refund, credit
or offset (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Taxing Authority). For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any
refund, credit or offset arising in connection with Taxes (including interest,
but net of any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund, credit or offset)
that relates to Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the
principles of Section 9.5, taking into account the type of Tax to which such
refund, credit or offset relates. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not
be required to pay Seller any refund or credit that was included as an asset
in Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3.

 

(b)Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, (i) make or change any Tax election related to

Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, except to the extent permitted by
Section 9.7(d), or (ii) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations with respect to) any
Seller-Signed Tax Return, Buyer-Signed Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax
Return, in each case, without Seller's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, in each case,
to the extent Buyer taking any such action would result in a Tax liability of
Seller for any Taxes that are the subject of such election or Tax Return.

Section 10.2Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Agreement, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against and from any

after the Closing to the extent such Losses arise out of or result from (a)
the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement,
(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement
requiring performance prior to Closing, (c) the breach of any other covenant
or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement, (d)

 

-59-

   

any of the Excluded Liabilities, or (e) the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity.
Notwithstanding that a Claim for Losses may fall into multiple categories of

Section 10.4Scope of Seller's Liability. 

 

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, from
and after the Closing, except for Claims arising from Fraud, the RandW Insurance
Policy shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds for the satisfaction of
all Claims of the Buyer Indemnitees for which indemnity is sought under
Sections 9.1(a), 10.2(a) and 10.2(e) hereunder, and, from and after the
Closing, recourse to the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for the Buyer Indemnitees for such Claims. For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event that Buyer does not obtain the RandW Insurance Policy, Seller is
not responsible for, and has no Liability with respect to, Claims brought
under Sections 9.1(a), 10.2(a) and 10.2(e) hereunder, except, and solely with
respect to, Taxes arising out of any breach of any Tax Covenant pursuant to

Seller Indemnitees under Sections 10.3(b) or (c) shall be available to Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, only for Losses, in the
aggregate, up to the amount of the Purchase Price actually received by Seller
(the "Cap"). No Buyer Indemnitee nor Seller Indemnitee shall have any right
to indemnification under Sections 10.2(b) or (c) or Sections 10.3(b) or (c),
as applicable, for any individual item where the Losses relating thereto are
less than U.S.$7,000 and such Losses shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the Cap have been reached.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.4,
none of the limitations set forth in Section 10.4(a) or Section 10.4(b) shall
apply with respect to Losses (and such Losses shall not be taken into account
in determining the Cap) (i) in respect of any of the Excluded Liabilities and
Seller's responsibility therefor or (ii) in respect of any Claim for Fraud or
injunctive or provisional relief (including specific performance); provided
that, notwithstanding anything else in this Article X, Seller's maximum
Liability with respect to

 

-60-

   

indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees for such Losses shall be an amount
equal to the amount of the Purchase Price actually received by Seller.

 

(d)Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Buyer Indemnitees or
Seller Indemnitees to, as applicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be
expected to give rise thereto.

 

(e)In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee
with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.3.

 

Section 10.5Claims. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it may
be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "Indemnifying Party")
of each matter, action, cause of action, claim, demand, fact or other
circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a "Claim") hereunder may
be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts
and information as are then reasonably available, including a good faith
estimate of the amount of Losses (to the extent estimable) and the specific
basis for indemnification hereunder to the extent known. Failure to give
prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced by such failure and then only to the extent of such
prejudice.

 

Section 10.6Defense of Actions. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit, Proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment by any third party with full authority to conduct
such defense and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the
Indemnified Party will fully cooperate in such defense; provided that the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such action, suit, Proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
consent to the entry of any Order or enter into any settlement (a) which
provides for any relief other than the payment of monetary damages for which
the Indemnified Party shall not be liable, (b) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third party claimant to the
Indemnified Party (and all other Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable) of a release from all Liability in respect thereof, or (c) which
includes any admission of wrongdoing, misconduct or violation of Law by the
Indemnified Party. After notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying
Party's election to assume the defense of such action, suit, Proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the
Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof at the written
request of the Indemnifying Party. As to those third party actions, suits,
Proceedings, claims, demands or assessments with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense, the
Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying Party an opportunity to
participate in such defense, at its cost and expense, and will consult with
the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the
same. The Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
10.6 to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be permitted to assume
the defense of any Proceeding if (1) the Claim for indemnification relates to

 

-61-

   

or arises in connection with any alleged criminal activity; (2) the Claim
seeks as the sole remedy any non-monetary relief against the Indemnified
Party; or (3) such Claim is being defended by the carrier under the RandW
Insurance Policy. The election of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
or prosecution of a Claim will not be deemed an admission by the Indemnifying
Party that the claims made in the Claim are within the scope of or subject to
indemnification under this Agreement. The parties shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of any third party Claim, with such cooperation to
include (x) the retention and, upon the Indemnifying Party's request, the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such third party Claim, and (y) the making available of
employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 

Section 10.7Limitation, Exclusivity. 

 

(a)No Claim with respect to a representation, warranty or covenant shall be
made or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given
written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the date set
forth in Section 10.1 for such representation, warranty or covenant to expire.
Other than (i) any dispute under Section 2.3 that is required to be decided by
the Accounting Firm, (ii) as expressly provided in this Section 10.7 regarding
Fraud and injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance)
if the Closing occurs, (iii) as expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement,
and (iv) pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, Article IX and this Article X
provides the exclusive means by which a party may assert and remedy any and
all Claims, and Section 12.11 provides the exclusive means by which a party
may bring actions, in each case, against the other party (or any of its
Affiliates) under or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. Except for injunctive and provisional relief
(including specific performance) if the Closing occurs and except as expressly
provided in any Ancillary Agreement, each party hereby waives and releases any
other remedies or claims that it may have against the other party (or any of
its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein or therein or relating to the Transferred
Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Excluded
Liabilities (including, inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery
under CERCLA or other Environmental Laws) except that nothing herein shall
limit the Liability of any party hereto for Fraud. With respect to any Losses
or other Liabilities arising under this Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall
only seek such Losses and Liabilities from Seller, and Buyer hereby waives the
right to seek Losses or other Liabilities from or equitable remedies, such as
injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of Seller or any director, officer or
employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates).

 

(b)The provisions of this Article X shall not apply with respect to any
matters relating to Taxes, other than (i) Section 10.1, (ii) Section 10.2,
(iii) Sections 10.4(a), and (b) and (iii) Section 10.8(a).

 

Section 10.8Calculation of Damages. 

 

(a)Each Indemnified Party and Indemnified Tax Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable Law, to obtain all insurance
proceeds (including proceeds under any RandW Insurance Policy) or other payments
from third parties to the extent any amounts are actually covered and
recoverable thereunder. The amount of Loss for which each Indemnified Party
may be entitled to recover for indemnification under this

 

-62-

   

Agreement, and the amount of Taxes for which each Indemnified Tax Party may be
entitled to seek indemnification under this Agreement, will be reduced by the
amount of any insurance proceeds or other payment from a third party actually
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Parties (or by the
Indemnified Tax Parties) with respect to such Loss (or Taxes), less the amount
of any costs or expenses incurred in procuring such recovery, deductibles,
premium increases or similar amounts, and (x) less any actual cash Tax benefit
or (y) plus any actual cash Tax cost, in each case realized by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates (or by the Indemnified Tax Party or any of its
Affiliates) in the year of the Loss or the succeeding two (2) years and
arising from the incurrence or payment of such Loss (or Taxes). In computing
the amount of any such Tax benefit or such Tax cost, each Indemnified Party
and Indemnified Tax Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising
from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss or indemnified Taxes. 

 

(b)If the Indemnified Party, after having received any indemnification payment
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a Loss, subsequently actually
receives or realizes any insurance proceeds with respect to such Loss such
Person will promptly refund and pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal
to such insurance proceeds, or payment (after deducting therefrom the amount
of any costs or expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery,
deductibles, premium increases or similar amounts, to the extent such
Indemnified Party did not already receive payment for such expenses or other
amounts in respect of such Claim from the Indemnifying Party), but not in
excess of any amount previously paid by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter
of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article X, and for purposes of
determining whether the representations and warranties giving rise to such
indemnification have been breached or are inaccurate, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the term, or, as applicable, clause containing, "material",
"materiality" or similar phrases or clauses (including "Material Adverse
Effect" or "material adverse effect") contained in such representation and
warranty.

 

Section 10.9Apportionment of Damages. In the event that a Loss is caused in
part by circumstances that would give rise to Seller's obligation to indemnify
under Section 10.2 and in part by circumstances that would give rise to
Buyer's obligation to indemnify under Section 10.3, the parties shall
indemnify each other in proportion to their respective shares of
responsibility. In such an instance the party with the largest share of
responsibility shall be treated as the Indemnifying Party for the purposes of
Section 10.6, with the costs of defense being shared proportionately.

 

ARTICLE XI 
TERMINATION

 

Section 11.1Termination Events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition abandoned
at any time prior to the Closing:

 

-63-

   

(a)by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b)by Seller if (i) any of the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 shall have
become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived by Seller, (ii)
forty-five (45) days have elapsed since the receipt by Buyer of a written
notice from Seller of such incapability and (iii) within such forty-five (45)
day period such condition shall not have become capable of fulfillment;
provided that Seller is not otherwise in breach or default of any provision of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 4.3
not to be satisfied and Seller is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, which breach would cause any
of the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 not to be satisfied;

 

(c)by Buyer if (i) any of the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 shall have
become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived by Buyer, (ii)
forty-five (45) days have elapsed since the receipt by Seller of a written
notice from Buyer of such incapability and (iii) within such forty-five (45)
day period such condition shall not have become capable of fulfillment;
provided that Buyer is not otherwise in breach or default of any provision of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 4.2
not to be satisfied and Buyer is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, which breach would cause any
of the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 not to be satisfied; or

 

(d)by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred (provided, that
the right to seek termination under this Section 11.1(d) shall not be
available to any party seeking to terminate this Agreement if such party's
failure to perform any covenant or to comply fully with its obligations under,
or any breach of its representations or warranties under, this Agreement shall
have been the principal cause of, or resulted in the failure thereof) on or
before October 25, 2020 (the "Outside Date"), or such later date as the
parties may agree upon in writing; provided, that the Outside Date may be
extended by Buyer, in its sole discretion, for up to two (2) periods of three
(3) months each in the event all conditions to Closing are satisfied or waived
other than the condition set forth in Section 4.1(b) and such other conditions
that are to be satisfied on the Closing Date; provided, further that the
Outside Date shall be automatically extended without any further action
required by either party to the last Business Day of the month in which the
Inside Date occurs if such date is extended beyond the term of the original
Outside Date pursuant to Section 3.1 (i.e., if the Inside Date is extended to
December 21, 2020, the new Outside Date would be December 31, 2020).

 

Section 11.2Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 11.1, all obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate and it will become void and of no further force or effect, except
that the Affiliate Guarantee and the obligations in Sections 7.1(a) with
respect to confidentiality, 11.2, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10 and 12.11 will
survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party
because of the breach of this Agreement by another party of any of its
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, or because one or more
of the conditions to the terminating party's obligations under this Agreement
is not satisfied as a result of the other party's failure to comply with its
covenant or obligations contained in this Agreement, then the terminating
party's right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired and nothing in this Section 11.2 shall be deemed to
release

 

-64-

   

any party from any Liability for any breach by such party of the terms,
conditions, covenants and other provisions of this Agreement.

Section 12.2Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller or, in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

 

Section 12.3Assignment. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, including by sale of equity
interests or by operation of Law in connection with a merger or sale of
substantially all assets, without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto; provided, however, that Buyer may assign, convey, transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or any portion of its interest in, or its rights and
obligations under, this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is
or will be a party to any Affiliate; provided, further, that no such
assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 12.4Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letter, Annexes and Exhibits), the Ancillary Agreements and the Affiliate
Guarantee comprise the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect for the
term provided for therein and any other written agreement of the parties that
expressly provides that it is not superseded by this Agreement.

 

Section 12.5Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 

Section 12.6Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except for Section 9.1 and Article X, which are intended
to benefit, and be enforceable by, the Persons specified therein, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person
other than Buyer, Seller or their successors or permitted assigns, any rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.7Public Disclosure. No communication, release or announcement to
the public or to employees or others not directly involved in the negotiation
or approval of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the terms hereof or
thereof or the Acquisition shall be issued or made by any party or any of its
Representatives without the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
communication, release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of

 

-66-

   

any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or similar organization, in each case
on the reasonable advice of outside counsel, and in which case the party
required to make the communication, release or announcement shall allow the
other party reasonable time to comment thereon in advance of such issuance and
the disclosing party shall consider, in good faith, any comments or revisions
proposed by the other party thereto; provided, however, that (i) each of the
parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are
consistent with the parties' prior public disclosures regarding the
Acquisition after reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other
parties and (ii) Buyer's controlling affiliate may conduct ordinary course
communications with their limited partners and prospective investors;
provided, in each case, that at the time of receipt of such information, such
recipient is subject to customary confidentiality undertakings or other
obligations of confidentiality to Buyer.

 

Section 12.8Return of Information. If for any reason whatsoever the
Acquisition is not consummated, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller all
books and records furnished by Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective employees or Representatives (including all copies, summaries and
abstracts, if any, thereof) in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 12.9Expenses. 

 

(a)Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including this
Section 12.9, each of the parties hereto shall be responsible for the payment
of its or any of its Affiliates' own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiations leading up to and the performance of its own obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the fees,
expenses and other costs of any attorneys, accountants, brokers or advisors
employed or retained by or on behalf of such party.

 

(b)The filing fees required by any Governmental Competition Authority shall be
borne by Buyer.

 

Section 12.10Schedules. 

 

(a)The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to this Agreement, in and of
itself, shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller, or
to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the purposes of this
Agreement. Disclosure of any matter, fact, or circumstance in any Schedule to
this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosure thereof for purposes of any
other Schedule for which applicability of such information and disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face.

 

(b)From time to time before the Closing, Seller may (but is not required to)
supplement any Schedule with respect to any matter arising or of which it
becomes aware after the date of this Agreement that, if such matter had
occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would be required to be
disclosed on such Schedule to make any of the representations or warranties
made by Seller true and correct as of the date hereof (each a "Schedule
Supplement"); provided, that any disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement
shall be for informational purposes only and will not under any circumstances
be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any

 

-67-

   

representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes
of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Article IV have been
satisfied.

 

Section 12.11Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and any and all
matters, disputes, or claims between the parties arising out of, relating to,
or in accordance with its subject matter or formation (including any
contractual disputes or claims), and whether purporting to be found in
contract or tort or at law or in equity, shall be governed by, enforced, and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
U.S.A., without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware, U.S.A. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court does not have
jurisdiction, any Delaware state court or United States Federal Court sitting
in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each party
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of such
Proceeding may be heard in such state court or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each party agrees to commence any such
Proceeding either in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such Proceeding may
not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in any Delaware state
court or United States Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (and any
appellate courts thereof). Each of Seller and Buyer further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such party's address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which such party has
submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 12.11. Each of Seller and Buyer
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
Acquisition, in any court referred to in the first sentence of this Section
12.11 and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

Section 12.12Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile, e-mail or
other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.13Headings. The heading references herein and the Table of
Contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 

Section 12.14Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this

 

-68-

   

Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 12.15Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL
ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL ACTIONS THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT
RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS,
TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY
CLAIMS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.15.

 

Section 12.16Specific Performance. 

 

(a)The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its terms or was otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable relief shall be in addition
to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in
equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. 

 

(b)Each party agrees to (i) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party
in obtaining any such equitable remedy and (ii) waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.
Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative (and not
alternative).

 

Section 12.17Legal Representation. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates acknowledges and agrees that SPB may have acted as counsel for
Seller or its Affiliates in certain matters and that Seller reasonably
anticipates that SPB will continue to represent them and/or such other parties
in future matters. Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, expressly: (a) consents to SPB's representation of Seller and its
Affiliates in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse,

 

-69-

   

including, any matter relating thereto; and (b) consents to the disclosure by
SPB to Seller or its Affiliates of any information learned by SPB in the
course of its representation of Seller or its respective Affiliates.
Furthermore, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, irrevocably waives
any right it may have to discover or obtain information or documentation
relating to the representation of Seller or its Affiliates by SPB in the
Acquisition, to the extent that such information or documentation was
privileged as to Seller or its Affiliates.
