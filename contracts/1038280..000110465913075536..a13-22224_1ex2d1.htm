Section 2.01 __The Closing__. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") will take place
at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on that date that is as soon as practicable (and,
in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth
in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder) of such

 



      
 

 



 

conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms
or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The Closing shall be held at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 53 State
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 2.02 __The Merger__.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall cause
a certificate of merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** ") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
for filing as provided in the DGCL.

 



 

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time when the
Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such later time and date as may be agreed by
the parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
**Effective Time** ").

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the " **Surviving Corporation** "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects specified in the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.03 __Conversion of Shares__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders thereof:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.03(b)_, _Section 2.03(c)_ or
_Section 2.05_ immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive $21.25 in cash without
interest (the " **Merger Consideration** "). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.04_, without interest;

 



 

(b) each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by any Buyer Entity or Merger Sub or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of any Buyer Entity or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

 



 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights,

 



      
 

 



 

powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.04 __Surrender and Payment__.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the
purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** ;" _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include
references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates (the "
**Payment Fund** "). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree) for use in such
exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of
a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock. Until so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights

 



      
 

 



 

pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

Section 2.05 __Dissenting Shares__. Notwithstanding _Section 2.03_, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to appraisal and
who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised
value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL following
which such shares shall be canceled; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holders right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.03(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate
formerly representing such shares. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relate to such demand, and
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.06 __Company Stock Options; Restricted Stock Unit Awards; ESPP__.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock
Option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, by (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise or settlement of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such product, the " **Cash Amount** "). From and after the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, any Company Stock Option shall no longer represent the right
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock by the former holder thereof, but
shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Cash Amount, if any.
Payment of the Cash Amount shall be paid as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, without interest. All payments provided pursuant to this
_Section 2.06(a)_ shall be made through the Companys payroll systems,
subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.08_.
If the exercise price per share of any Company Stock Option equals or exceeds
the Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice
to each holder of a Company Stock Option informing such holder of the effect
of the Merger on the Company Stock Options.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding
restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award under the Company Stock
Plans (the " **Company RSUs** ") shall become fully vested, shall not be
assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall be canceled and
extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such Company RSU shall have the right to receive from Parent or
the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable
hereunder, the " **RSU Award Payments** " and, together with the aggregate
Merger Consideration and the aggregate Cash Amount, the " **Aggregate Merger
Consideration** "). From and after the Effective Time, any Company RSU shall
no longer represent the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of

holds any Material Leased Property (each, a " **Lease Agreement** ")
(including all amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties and other
agreements with respect thereto) for each such Material Leased Property
(including the date and name of the parties to such Lease Agreement document).
The Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of each such
Lease Agreement and the Company is not party to any oral Lease Agreement.

interest in the Companys leasehold interests or any right to the use or
occupancy of any Material Leased Property; (iii) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has performed all material obligations required to be performed
by it to date under each Lease Agreement and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other party to each
Lease Agreement is in breach or default under such Lease Agreements, and to

constitute a breach or default, or permit the termination, modification or
acceleration of rent under such Lease Agreements; (iv) with respect to each
Material Leased Property, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any Person a right to use or occupy
such Material Leased Property or any portion thereof; (v) the Companys and

the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or any "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "interested stockholder," "affiliate
transaction," "business combination" or other antitakeover Applicable Law (a "
**Standstill Release/Waiver** ") (other than to the extent the Company Board
or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to provide a
Standstill Release/Waiver would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and that such Standstill
Release/Waiver could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal)
and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law each such
agreement.

 



 

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative of
the Company takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute
a breach by the Company of _Section 6.02(a)_, _Section 6.02(b)_ or _Section
6.02(d)_, the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of _Section 6.02(a)_,
_Section 6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.02(d)_, as applicable.

 



 

Section 6.03 __Company Recommendation__.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.03(b)_ and _Section 6.03(c)_, none of the Company
Board, the Special Committee or any other committee of the Company Board shall
(i) fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to

fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (vi) other
than as described in clause (iii) above, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days after receipt of a written
request by Parent to provide such affirmation following public disclosure of
an Acquisition Proposal other than an Acquisition Proposal made pursuant to a
commenced tender

 



      
 

 



 

or exchange offer or (vii) resolve or publicly propose to take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) (each of the foregoing
actions described in clauses (i) through (vii) being referred to as an "
**Adverse Recommendation Change** ").

 



 

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Stockholder Approval (and subject to the Companys or the
Company Boards, as applicable, compliance with this _Section 6.03_, _Section
6.02_ and _Section 9.04_), the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee) may, if the Company Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel),
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to either (1) a Superior Proposal received
after the date hereof or (2) any material fact, event, change, development or
circumstances occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement not known
or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof, which
fact, event, change, development or circumstances becomes known to the Company
Board prior to the Stockholder Approval (such material fact, event, change,
development or circumstance, an " **Intervening Event** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or
the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event, or (B) cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ and to
authorize and simultaneously to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
subject in each case to compliance with the terms of paragraph (ii) or (iii)
below, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) In the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change sought to be made under
clause (1) of _Section 6.03(b)(i)(A)_ or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ in response to a Superior Proposal, (x) no
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made
and (y) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ may be
made, in either case

 



 

(A) until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board, absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Capital Commitment Letter,
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_ (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of
all relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which shall require
a new notice period of two (2) Business Days, and compliance with this
_Section 6.03(b)_ with respect to such new notice); and

 



 

(B) unless during such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day
period following an amended proposal), the Company shall, and

 



      
 

 



 

shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, (1)
negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Capital Commitment Letter so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (2)
permit Parent and Parents Representatives to make a presentation to the
Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect
thereto, and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2)
Business Day period following an amended proposal), the Company Board (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) again makes the
determination in good faith (x) after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of this Agreement would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and (y) after taking into account any adjustment or
modification to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal.

 



 

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Third Party to limit or not to give
prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made

 



 

(A) until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board or any committee thereof
intends to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the
determination by the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for
the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a " **Notice of
Intervening Event** ");

 



 

(B) unless during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent,
negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement
and the Capital Commitment Letter in such a manner that obviates the need for
an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 



 

(C) unless, by the expiration of such four (4) Business Day period, the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith, taking into consideration any amendments to this
Agreement and the Capital Commitment Letter proposed by Parent (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel),
that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law.

 



       
 

 



 

Any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 6.03(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in _Section 6.02_ or this _Section 6.03_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee), after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or any
disclosure requirements under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
that the Company and the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.03(b)_.
In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement,
a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
similar communication to the stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute
an Adverse Recommendation Change or a proposal by the Company Board to
withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.04 __Approval of Merger__.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the
Companys governing documents, duly set a record date for, call, give notice
of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys stockholders
(including any adjournments and postponements thereof, the " **Stockholder
Meeting** ") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the matters
requiring Stockholder Approval (with the record date and meeting date set in
consultation with Parent). Unless the Company Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) has withdrawn the Company
Recommendation in compliance with _Section 6.03_, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders and to solicit from stockholders of the Company
proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and shall take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
holders of Shares required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger and, subject
to _Section 6.03_ and _Article 8_, the Company Board shall cause the Company
Recommendation to be included in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy/information statement in
preliminary form for the Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "
**Proxy Statement** ") seeking stockholder approval of the matters requiring
Stockholder Approval and file it with the SEC. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy
Statement, and to resolve any such comments, and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the

 



      
 

 



 

resolution of any such comments. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
notify the others promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement and shall supply the others with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement,
including furnishing as promptly as practicable to the Company in writing upon
request any and all information relating to it as may be required to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting or filed with the SEC (as
applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required
filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall consider Parents comments in good faith. The Company shall
ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, then the party hereto that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, the Company shall file as promptly as practicable
with the SEC and disseminate to the holders of Company Common Stock an
appropriate amendment or supplement containing such information.

 



 

Section 6.05 __Access to Information__. Subject to Applicable Law, _Section
6.12(c)_, _Section 6.17_ and applicable contractual restrictions, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents officers and Parents other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to those of its properties, personnel, books, Contracts,
records, Tax Returns and work papers as Parent may reasonably request to
review. The foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to provide access to
or otherwise make available or furnish any books, Contracts, records or work
papers governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar
agreement in effect as of the date hereof, (b) to provide access to or
otherwise make

 



      
 

 



 

available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision
of such information would, in the good faith judgment of the Company based on
the advice of counsel, reasonably be expected to result in the loss of any
attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege or protection (it being
agreed that, (i) in the case of clauses (a) and (b), the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or waive the
applicable privilege or protection) and (ii) in the case of clause (a), the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of
third parties that are necessary to permit such access, (c) to provide access
to or otherwise make available any information relating to the process
conducted by the Company that led to the execution of this Agreement, or (d)
to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if
and to the extent that the provision of such information would, in the good
faith judgment of the Company based on the advice of counsel, reasonably be
expected to violate any Applicable Law. All requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be deemed
Evaluation Material (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
and be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, contact any
customer or supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the Companys
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
any such contact shall be arranged with a Representative of the Company
participating; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent to obtain the Companys prior written consent (or to
all participation) regarding discussions in the ordinary course of business
unrelated to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with Parents customers or suppliers (regardless of whether such Persons are
also customers or suppliers of the Company).

 



 

Section 6.06 __Notice of Certain Events__. From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other in
writing of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or breach of
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to cause, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03_ not to be satisfied, and, in
the case of the Company, any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or
_Section 7.02_ not to be satisfied;

 



 

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent of such party is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 



 

(c) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.06_ shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 6.07 __Employee Benefit Plan Matters__.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a change in
control of the Company and/or a sale event or similar transaction of the
Company (to the extent such concepts are applicable) for purposes of the
Company Employee Plans, including under the severance agreements with the
members of management of the Company listed in _Schedule 6.07(a)_ (such
members of management, the " **Executive Employees** " and such agreements,
the " **Severance Agreement** "). The Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
pay to the applicable employees of the Company any amounts with respect to any
severance obligations or other amounts that are payable under the Severance
Agreements in accordance with their terms in the event of a qualified
termination upon or within 24 months after the consummation of the Merger,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable following the Closing (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date immediately following the Closing), pay to each Executive
Employee, and to each employee covered under the Severance Policy, in each
case whose employment is terminated on the Closing Date at the direction of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the full cash change in control and/or
severance amounts payable to such employee under the Severance Agreement or
the Severance Policy, as applicable.

 



 

(b) With respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
before the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Closing Date (" **Continuing Employees** "), Parent
shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee to be recognized for
purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but not for
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under
each compensation, retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
ERISA Affiliates, but not including any equity compensation plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements (collectively, the " **Parent Benefit Plans** ") in
which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but
solely to the extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes
under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
and to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) (A) base salary and (B)
cash incentive compensation opportunities, in each case in an amount at least
equal to the same level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) employee benefits (other than
equity awards or other equity-based compensation or benefits) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Company
Employee Plans set forth on _Section 4.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and (iii) honor the provisions of the Severance Policy.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing
Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-
existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and
exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term disability, life insurance
benefits and other non-health coverages, solely to the extent permitted under
the terms and conditions of Parents applicable plans and insurance contracts
in effect as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility
conditions based on periods of employment, _Section 6.07(b)_ shall control;
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and
prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in
such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible
requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for such calendar year, to the
extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the
comparable Company Employee Plan.

 



 

(e) Parent agrees that, prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, at the
Companys sole discretion, be permitted to pay to the Companys employees
bonuses in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount detailed on _Schedule
6.07(e)_ , including all bonuses payable under or pursuant to any cash bonus
plan, incentive plan or other similar plan or practice of the Company. To the
extent such payments do not occur prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall pay
or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts as directed by the
Company in the Companys sole discretion, such payments to occur as promptly
as practicable, but in any event no later than the first payroll period after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) If directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt written resolutions and a plan
amendment to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan and to fully (100%) vest all
participants under such plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no
later than one (1) Business Day preceding the Closing Date (but may be
contingent on the Closing). The form and substance of such written resolutions
and plan amendment must be preapproved by Parent, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plan as
Parent may reasonably request.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
or other rights in any current or former employee, director or other service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of employment,
continued employment, any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan. Nothing in
this _Section 6.07_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an
amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement of any party, including
any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.08 __State Takeover Laws__. If any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements,
then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, as applicable, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

 



 

Section 6.09 __Obligations of Merger Sub__. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.10 __Voting of Shares__. Each Buyer Entity shall vote any shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in
favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote
or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.11 __Director and Officer Liability__.

 



 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.11(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement
(the " **Current Premium** ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at
any time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the amount paid for such prepaid policies
does not exceed 250% of the Current Premium and (ii) the material terms of
such prepaid policies including coverage and amount are no more favorable in
the aggregate to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage
otherwise required under this _Section 6.11(a)_. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " **Indemnified Party** ")
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel which shall be advanced
following receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such
amounts if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification under this _Section 6.11_) in connection with any
Proceeding whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
(A) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Party in
the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of any other Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party subject to the undertaking in this _Section 6.11_ to repay advanced
amounts), to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law; and (ii)
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to: (x) each indemnification agreement in effect between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party as of the
date of this Agreement, the form of which has been Made Available to Parent;
and (y) any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses
subject to the undertaking in this _Section 6.11_ to repay advanced amounts)
and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parents and
the Surviving Corporations obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses under this _Section
6.11_ in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation fails to comply with its obligations in this _Section 6.11(b)_
and an Indemnified Party commences a suit which results in a binding
determination that the Parent or the Surviving Corporation failed to comply
with such obligation, Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest thereon at the rate of
interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

 



 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives

 



      
 

 



 

and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.11_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
rights of the Indemnified Parties as third-party beneficiaries under this
_Section 6.11_ shall not arise unless and until the Merger is consummated).

 



 

Section 6.12 __Reasonable Best Efforts__.

 



 

(a) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.12_, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and

requested by Parent to obtain waivers or consents from any Significant
Customers, if required under any Contracts with Significant Customers, and any
Third Parties whose waiver or consent is required under any Material Contract.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i)
promptly, but in no event later than October 29, 2013, file any and all

Justice (the " **DOJ** ") or Federal Trade Commission (" **FTC** ") under the
HSR Act or by any other Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) use reasonable best efforts
to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or
appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) promptly take,
and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable actions and steps requested
or required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve such objections, if any,

 



      
 

 



 

as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any other
jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances,
approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required with
respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its
Affiliates will only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or
agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment,
agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company or its
Subsidiaries or on Parent or its Affiliates only in the event the Closing
occurs; _provided_ , _further_ that, subject to the obligations of Parent set
forth in this _Section 6.12(d)_  _(f)_ , the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall only be permitted to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to
any such condition or restriction, with the prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.12_, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other
parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Proceeding, and (iii) promptly inform the other
parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority to the extent regarding the Merger or other transactions
contemplated hereby, or regarding any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all written communications.
Subject to Applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable, each of
Parent or Company, as the case may be, will consult the other on all the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement) and shall incorporate all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall be
entitled to direct and control (i) all communications, strategy and defense of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) all negotiations and
settlement discussions, if necessary, with any Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall keep the Company informed of
Parents contacts with any Governmental Authority, allow the Companys lawyers
to review and comment on submissions and presentations, and allow the
Companys lawyers to attend any meetings and participate in any telephone
conference, without limitation; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if review of
any information would be material in connection with any second request (or
similar process), such information shall be provided solely to those
individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other parties provided
that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such other parties
and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the providing party.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every
impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to
enable the parties to consummate the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the End
Date), including without limitation (i) committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license,
transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating,

 



      
 

 



 

relinquishing, modifying, transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving
existing agreements, collaborations, relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or Company or their
respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating or consenting to create any
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations, behavioral
undertakings or other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective
Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements
and stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate
applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with any of the
foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such
action by the Company (each a " **Divestiture Action** "). Subject to Parents
obligations in this _Section 6.12_, Parent shall have the sole and exclusive
right to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or otherwise
offer to take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect) to take any Divestiture Action as may be required to resolve any
Governmental Authoritys objections to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
consider in good faith the views of the Company and its counsel in connection
therewith. If any of the assets or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any combination
thereof, are required to be divested in order to secure antirust approval from
any Governmental Authority to satisfy the condition contained in _Section
7.01(c)_, neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to take, or
cause to be taken, any Divestiture Action with respect to such assets or
businesses if the net revenues from such assets and businesses for the twelve
(12) months ended December 31, 2012 exceeded $15,000,000 in the aggregate. For
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, "net revenues" shall mean
gross revenues after commissions.

 



 

(e) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such litigation, action or
proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall take any and all action to resolve any
such litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be
expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify

the Company will in good faith take into account), and participate and consult
in the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation, and no such
settlement, or other compromise or arrangement, of any Stockholder Litigation

public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as such release or announcement may be required
by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and
allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances)
to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and
the party will consider such comments in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
consult with Parent before issuing any press release or making any other
public statement with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change effected in
accordance with _Section 6.03_ or with respect to its receipt and
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company.

to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law.

(unless waived by Parent) or otherwise impair or delay the parties
obligations under this Agreement, including the consummation of the Merger,
(ii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that
will conflict with or violate the Companys organizational documents or any

entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if,
at the time of such termination, any Buyer Entity or Merger Sub is in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(f) by the Company, in the event of a breach by any Buyer Entity or Merger Sub
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
that (i) would result in any condition set forth in _Section 7.03_ not being
satisfied and (ii) has not been cured prior to the earlier of the End Date or
the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the Companys delivery of written
notice describing such breach to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.01(f)_ if, at the time of such termination, the Company is in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement (other than under _Section 6.19_);

 



 

(g) by the Company, if prior to the Stockholder Approval the Company Board
shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.03_, the Company has complied in all
respects (other than immaterial noncompliance) with _Section 6.02_, and
substantially concurrently with such termination the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
provided that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.01(g)_ is conditioned on and subject to the prior or
concurrent payment by the Company to Parent of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 9.04_, and any purported termination pursuant to
this _Section 8.01(g)_ shall be void and of no force or effect if the Company
shall not have paid the Company Termination Fee;

 



 

(h) by the Company if (A) the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing _provided_ that each such condition
is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) have been
satisfied or waived and (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the
Merger within three (3) Business Days after the delivery by the Company to
Parent of a notice to such effect; or

 



      
 

 



 

(i) by Parent if (A) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Company shall have
willfully and materially breached its obligations under _Section 6.02_.

 



 

Section 8.02 __Effect of Termination__. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any Representative of such party) to each
other party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this
_Section 8.02_, the penultimate sentence of _Section 6.05_, _Section 6.17_,
_Section 6.19(f)_ and _Article 9_ shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to _Section 8.01_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Buyer Entities,
Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the
extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such partys
equity holders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, including in consideration in respect of
Company Equity Awards, other combination opportunities and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party) arising out of its
knowing or intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement (other than,
in the case of the Company, _Section 6.19_) or any other agreement delivered
in connection herewith, subject only, with respect to any such liabilities of
the Company, to _Section 9.04(b)_, and with respect to any such liabilities
of the Buyer Entities and Merger Sub, to _Section 9.04(d)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, the failure of the Buyer Entities or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger on the date required by _Section 2.01_ after the conditions set forth
in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing and which are capable of being satisfied on the
Closing Date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is the
Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a knowing and
intentional breach by the Buyer Entities and Merger Sub, and the Buyer
Entities shall be liable to the Company for such breach as provided herein
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided in this Agreement, including in the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 8.02_, nothing shall relieve any party for fraud.

Section 9.03 __Amendments and Waivers__.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

consent of such Debt Financing Party.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 9.04 __Expenses; Payment of Termination Fee__.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense, whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees payable pursuant to (i) the HSR Act
and (ii) any other Antitrust Laws;

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_; or

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(i)_; or

 



 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_, (B) after the
date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Stockholder Meeting (in the case
of _Section 8.01(d)_ ) or at or prior to the time of termination of this
Agreement (in the case of _Section 8.01(e)_) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly made, commenced or submitted or publicly announced or made

similar Contract or arrangement related to an Acquisition Proposal, in each
case which is a binding and enforceable obligation of the Company to effect
such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, for purposes of _this Section
9.04(b)(iii)_, all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be replaced with 50%,

 



 

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee in an amount equal to $11,000,000 (the
" **Company Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to an
account designated by Parent (i) in the case of _Section 9.04(b)(i)_, within
two (2) Business Days after such termination, (ii) in the case of _Section
9.04(b)(ii)_, concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, the
termination of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ and (iii) in the case of
_Section 9.04(b)(iii)_, on the date that is the first of the following to
occur: (x) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or (y) the Company
enters into enters into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar Contract or arrangement related to an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case which is a binding and enforceable
obligation of the Company to effect such Acquisition Proposal. In the event
that Parent shall receive full payment pursuant to this _Section 9.04(b)_,
the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement (other than equitable relief to require payment of the
Company Termination Fee), any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. If the Company fails to pay
the Company Termination Fee and Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which
results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the
Company Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay
Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the Company Termination Fee at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under _Section
9.04(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect to _Section 9.04(b)_ and not
in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. Parent shall have the right to assign the right to receive
the Company Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignment
shall not in any manner whatsoever affect the parties agreements set forth in
the last paragraph of _Section 9.04(b)_.

 



 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_, and at the time of such termination
any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ (under conditions
attributable to one or more Antitrust Laws) or _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not
have been satisfied or waived or (ii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_ (under conditions attributable to one or more Antitrust
Laws), and at the time of such termination under either _Section 8.01(b)_ or
_Section 8.01(c)_, all conditions set forth in _Article 7_ other than those
attributable to Antitrust Laws have been satisfied or waived by the party or
parties then entitled to give such waiver (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied as of the Closing, _provided_ that each such
condition is then capable of being satisfied), then Parent shall pay the
Company a fee equal to $15,000,000 (the " **Parent Termination Fee** ") by
wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day following such
termination. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment pursuant
to this _Section 9.04(d)_, the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company in connection with this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and the Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or Proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (other
than equitable relief to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee), any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for
such termination. If Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee and the
Company commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment
against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then
Parent shall pay the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Parent Termination Fee at the "prime rate" as published in The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Parent under _Section
9.04(d)_ shall be payable only once with respect to _Section 9.04(d)_ and not
in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof.

 



 

Section 9.05 __Assignment; Benefit__. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors,
administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except for (a) the rights of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) the rights of
the holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the payments in respect
thereof following the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.06_, (c) the
rights of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 6.11_ and (d) with
respect to the Debt Financing Parties, _Section 9.08_ and _Section 9.12_,
which, in each case, shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities
benefiting therefrom who are hereby expressly intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein. For
the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Effective Time, the rights and remedies
conferred on the Companys equity holders pursuant to _Article 2_ concerning
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration may only be enforced by the
Company acting on the behalf of the Companys equity holders. The parties
hereto further agree that, except for those rights contained in clause (d) of
the second preceding sentence, the rights of third-party beneficiaries under
this _Section 9.05_ shall not arise unless and until the Merger is
consummated.

 



 

Section 9.06 __Governing Law__. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such State.

 



 

Section 9.07 __Jurisdiction__. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if
that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting

 



       
 

 



 

in the State of Delaware. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,
suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner
contemplated by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by law.

 



 

Section 9.08 __Waiver of Jury Trial__. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY DEBT FINANCING USED TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER OR THE
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY).

 



 

Section 9.09 __Specific Performance__.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and, accordingly that
the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereto agree that unless
and until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section
8.01_ and any dispute over the right to termination has been finally resolved,
(i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from
a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including to
specifically enforce a partys obligation to effect the Closing, but excluding
the Companys covenants in _Section 6.19_), without bond, surety or other
security being required and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company, Parent, CSC,
Holdings, or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of
such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any such injunction or
award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason. The parties hereto further agree that (x) following the
Companys valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.01_, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a
court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to enforce
each of the Buyer Entities and Merger Subs surviving obligations herein,
including with respect to the payment of monetary damages under _Section
8.02_ or the payments to which the Company is entitled under _Section
9.04(d)_, and (ii) following Parents valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.01_, Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to enforce specifically the
Companys surviving obligations herein, including with respect to the payment
of monetary damages under _Section 8.02_ or the payments to which Parent is
entitled under _Section 9.04(b)_.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 9.09_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of
this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section 9.09_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for
(or limit any partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
_Section 9.09_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or
limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available at any time and (iii) a party may seek and plead in the
alternative any remedies available to it hereunder until a remedy is awarded.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, while
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the
extent expressly permitted by this _Section 9.09_ and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section
9.04_), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both such grant of specific performance to require Parent and Merger
Sub to effect the Closing and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 



 

Section 9.10 __Severability__. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.11 __Buyer Entities Guarantees__.

 



 

(a) Each of Holdings and CSC shall cause Parent and Merger Sub to comply in
all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a
material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder, each of Holdings and CSC hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Parent and Merger
Sub of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be
performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees
that any such breach of any

 



      
 

 



 

such representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Parent or Merger Sub shall
also be deemed to be a breach or default of Holdings and CSC.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply in all respects with each of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
undertakings made or required to be performed by Merger Sub in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement to the Companys
willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full performance and
payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings
required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject to all terms, conditions and
limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges
and agrees that any such breach of any such representation and warranty or
default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or
undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of
Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such
breach or nonperformance directly against any or all of the Buyer Entities and
Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in this _Section
9.11_ to " _Merger Sub_ " shall also include the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.12 __Debt Financing Parties__. None of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims against any
Debt Financing Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments of
such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt
Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to the Company or its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for
any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any claims or causes of action
brought against any Debt Financing Party in its capacity as such will not be
brought in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York and shall be governed
by the law of the State of New York. It is further agreed that the Debt
Financing Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of, this _Section 9.12_ and _Section 9.08_.

 



 

Section 9.13 __Entire Agreement; No Reliance__.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and any documents delivered
by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject

 



      
 

 



 

matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article 4_ and _Article 5_ of this Agreement,
neither the Company, Parent or Merger Sub makes any other representations or
warranties and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties
made by itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other
partys Representatives of any document or other information with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and
warranties made by the parties in this Agreement, each of the Buyer Entities
and Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiary makes
or has made any representation or warranty with respect to (i) any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, or
(ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to it, including the information in the
electronic data room of the Company, with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made in this Agreement.

acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed
the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
