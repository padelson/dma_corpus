A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 4



The acting Notary Public has drawn the attention of the persons appearing to
the fact, that ‑ as he does not have sufficient knowledge and information
regarding South Carlina corporations and their representation ‑ he could not
examine the representation power of Messrs. Tiede and Mahoney regarding the
Pasrent Guarantor. Nevertheless the persons appearing insisted on the
immediate notarization and released Messrs. Tiede and Mahoney from submitting
other and further documents evidencing or supporting their representation
capacity.

The acting Notary advised the persons appearing that a notary who or whose
partners in the law firm have formerly acted as legal advisors to one of the
parties involved in the matter to be notarized would not be entitled to take
office as a notary in the matter at hand pursuant to §§ 23 ss. of the Act of
Notarization of the Canton Basel-City, which provisions correspond with the
so-called "Vor-be-fassungs-verbot" under the German Act of Notarization (§ 3
Sect. 1(7)). The acting Notary states that he himself and his firm have not
been involved in the matter at hand in the meaning of said provisions. The
Parties hereto confirm such statement of the acting Notary.

The persons appearing requested this Deed to be recorded in the English
language. The acting Notary Public who is in sufficient command of the English
language ascertained that the persons appearing are of English mother tongue
or otherwise in command of the English language. After having been instructed
by the acting Notary, the persons appearing, who are not of English mother
tongue, waived the right to obtain the assistance of a sworn interpreter and
to obtain a certified translation of this Deed.

______________

The persons appearing, acting as indicated, declared with request for notarial
recording the following:

The persons appearing have full knowledge of the Notarial Deed A.Prot.
2014/124 of the acting Notary of 22 August 2014 ("Reference Deed"). The
original of the Reference Deed was available for inspection during the present
notarisation. The parties hereby confirm the entire wording and content of the
Reference Deed and the declarations made by Ms. Marina Schai on their behalf.
The persons appearing waived the right to have the Reference Deed read aloud
and to have it attached to this present Deed.

Any reference in the present Deed to a Schedule or Exhibit shall be deemed as
a reference to the corresponding Schedule or Exhibit in the Reference Deed as
far as such Schedule or Exhibit is not replaced, amended or altered in a
Schedule or Exhibit to the present Deed.

case may be, and any other document or information reasonably requested by
Sellers and necessary for Sellers for purposes of this Section 3.7.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

In the event that Seller does not object to Purchaser's Proposed Calculations
and the Closing Accounts by written notice of objection (the "Notice of
Objection") delivered to Purchaser within thirty (30) Business Days after
Sellers' receipt of Purchaser's Proposed Calculations and the Closing
Accounts, the Closing Accounts and the calculation of the Purchase Price
pursuant to Purchaser's Proposed Calculations shall be deemed final and
binding. A Notice of Objection under this Section 3.7(c) shall set forth in
detail Sellers' alternative calculations of (i) the amount of the Closing
Cash, the Closing Financial Debt and the Closing Net Working Capital Amount
and (ii) a recalculation of the Purchase Price based on such amounts, each
clarifying any deviations to Purchaser's Proposed Calculations. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If Sellers deliver a Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the thirty (30)
Business Day period referred to in Section 3.7(c), then any element of
Purchaser's Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such
Notice of Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding and any
dispute regarding amounts, calculations or accounting items (each a "Closing
Account Dispute") shall be resolved as set forth in sub‑sections (e) through
(i) below. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Sellers and Purchaser shall promptly endeavor in good faith to resolve the
Closing Account Disputes listed in the Notice of Objection. If the Parties
fail to reach such an agreement within twenty one (21) days from the date when
Sellers delivered the Notice of Objection, the Closing Account Dispute may be
referred, at the request of either Party, for decision to an independent
chartered accountant, primarily Ernst and Young GmbH
Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, and if unavailable, BDO International, and if
neither are available, an accountant appointed by the chairman of the
management board of the Institute of Public auditors in Germany (Vorsitzender
des Vorstandes des Instituts der Wirtschaftsprufer in Deutschland) in
Dusseldorf (the "Closing Expert"); provided, that if no such notice of
referral is made by either Party within the twenty one (21) day period from
the delivery of the Notice of Objection, the recalculation of the Initial
Purchase Price pursuant to Notice of Objection shall be deemed final and
binding. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Sellers and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Closing Expert to render a decision in accordance with this Section 3.7
along with a statement of reasons thereto within thirty (30) days of the
submis- 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 32



sion of the Closing Account Dispute to the Closing Expert, or a reasonable
time thereafter.

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

If Sellers and Purchaser submit any Closing Account Dispute to the Closing
Expert for resolution, Sellers and Purchaser shall each pay their own costs
and expenses incurred under this Section 3.7, and all fees and expenses of the
Closing Expert shall be borne equally by the Parties, except in each case if
the Closing Expert determines that the allocation of such costs and expenses
should be allocated between Purchaser and Seller in another manner, e.g.
considering the relative merit of the Parties' positions in the Closing
Account Dispute. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

The Closing Expert shall act as an expert in the meaning of § 317 BGB and not
as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the provisions of this Section 3.7,
only the Closing Account Dispute and the determination of each amount,
calculation or accounting item of the Closing Account Dispute shall be made
solely in reliance on submissions and supporting material provided by the
Parties; any such submissions made by one Party shall also be disclosed to the
other Party. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate with and assist, and shall
cause their respective accountants and the Target Group Companies to cooperate
with and assist the Closing Expert in the conduct of its review. The Closing
Expert may not resolve that the value of a particular disputed item is higher
or lower, as applicable, than the highest or lowest value proposed for such
item by Sellers or Purchaser, and the aggregate adjustment to be payable by
either Party may not be greater or less than the highest or lowest amount
proposed by Sellers or Purchaser. The Closing Expert's decision (in the
absence of manifest error, negligence and/or fraud) shall be final and binding
on the Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Upon the determination of the Purchase Price, Sellers or Purchaser, as the
case may be, shall make, or cause to be made, the payment required by this
Section 3.7(i). The amount payable by Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 3.7(i) is referred to herein as the "Purchase Price Adjustment" and
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If the Purchase Price exceeds the Initial Purchase Price, then (i) Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers the amount of such difference within ten (10) Business
Days of the determination of the Purchase Price, such Purchaser Price
Adjustment to be paid in accordance with Section 3.2 and (ii) the Parties will
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers the full amount of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds. 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 33


| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the Purchase Price falls short of the Initial Purchase Price, then the
amount of such difference shall be released from the Escrow Account to
Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the Purchase
Price, provided that, if the amount of such difference exceeds Four Million
Euros (€4,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds"), then in
addition to the aforementioned escrow release, all amounts in excess of such
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Purchaser's Account or such other account
designated by Purchaser in writing to Sellers. To the extent that any portion
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds are not released to Purchaser
under this paragraph, the Parties will instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Sellers the full amount of such remainder of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

The amount due shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the day when paid
in accordance with (i) or (ii) above at a rate of 5 (five) per cent per annum.

The Parties mutually assume that the sale and transfer of the Shares, the
Partnership Interest, the WH GmbH Share, and the Purchaser US Participation
(the "Sale") is not subject to and is exempt from value added tax
(Umsatzsteuer, "VAT") and agree not to treat the Sale and transfer of the
Shares, the Partnership Interest, the WH GmbH Shares, and the Purchaser US
Participation as subject to VAT. If VAT becomes payable as a result of the
consummation of the Sale, the whole amount of such VAT shall be borne by
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay such VAT in addition to the Purchase Price.
The amount of such VAT shall be paid subject to the issuing of an invoice by
Sellers which shall meet all legal requirements according to the respective
provisions of the applicable laws.

require the prior written consent of Sellers which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Sellers will provide Purchaser with all necessary
information and/or data that is required to submit a complete filing to the
competent authorities without undue delay.

respects with each other in the preparation of any filing or notification and
in connection 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 39

periods to commence and expire, (iii) promptly provide each other with copies
of any written communication received or sent (or written summaries of any
non-written communication) in connection with any proceeding and (iv) give
each other and their respective advisors the opportunity to participate in all

unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser is obligated to offer, consent,
and comply with, obligations or conditions (Auflagen und Bedingungen) or other
agreements required by any competent merger control authority as a condition

7.1

|

Tax Indemnification 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless (freistellen) Purchaser, or at the
election of Purchaser, the respective Target Group Company from and against: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any liability for any Taxes relating to time periods prior to or arising on
the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt for interest and penalties also
for the period after the Closing Date if they are assessed on Taxes until and
including the Closing Date), whereby such indemnification shall only apply if
Taxes are actually levied on any of the Target Group Companies or a legal
successor, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, if any increased taxable
income may be set-off against tax loss carry forwards until the Closing Date;
with respect to Taxes payable for a Tax period
(Veranlagungszeitraum/Erhebungszeitraum) which begins prior to the Closing
Date and which ends after such date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date shall be computed as
if this period until Closing Date was a separate fiscal year (however with
respect to interest/ Tax loss carry forwards and ongoing Tax losses the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and a potential forfeiture of
those losses shall be considered in such a Straddle Period); and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

any damage resulting from a breach of the Tax warranty provided in Section
8.20. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Seller's obligation set out in Section 7.1(a) does not apply if and to the
extent such Taxes: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

have been paid by any Target Group Company before Closing or accrued for as
Tax liabilities/provisions in the Closing Accounts irrespective of whether
such liability or provision relates to the specific Taxes giving rise to such
claim; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

have been recovered, or are recoverable through commercially reasonable
efforts, by Purchaser or any of the Target Group Companies from any third
party (particularly under an insurance policy), but only in the net amount
after Taxes in case the recovery is taxable; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

result from a change of accounting methods for Taxes or practices for Taxes by
Purchaser or Target Group Companies after the Closing Date that 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 49



relate to the period before the Closing Date unless such change, Taxation or
practice is required by Law for periods prior to the Closing Date;

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

are the result of any reorganization, restructuring, transformation, change of
corporate form or action of Purchaser and/or the Target Group Companies after
the Closing Date with retroactive effect prior to the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

correspond to or can be offset against reductions, refunds or any other kind
of savings of Taxes, inter alia, due to the lengthening of depreciation
periods or higher depreciation allowances or from a transfer of taxable items
or events from one calendar or fiscal year into another or from one legal
entity to another (together the "Tax Benefits"); it being understood that the
net present value of the Tax Benefit shall be considered if it materializes
within five (5) years after the Closing Date and that the net present value
shall be calculated on the basis of the Tax rates applicable at the Closing
Date and an applied discount factor of five (5) per cent per annum. For the
avoidance of doubt: (i) quasi permanent effects; (ii) any Tax Benefits that
relate to a step-up triggered by the execution or consummation of this
Agreement and/or the termination of the Silent Partnership; and (iii) a
reduction of the step-up which otherwise would have been triggered by the
execution or consummation of this Agreement and/or the termination of the
Silent Partnership shall not be considered; 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

the respective Taxes have been caused by a material non-compliance of any
Target Group Company, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates after the Closing
Date with the procedures set forth under this Agreement; or 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

result from income that may be offset against a loss-carry back or loss carry
forward available at the level of the relevant Target Group Company and
generated in periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Indemnification payments made by Sellers under Section 7.1(a) shall become due
on the tenth (10th) Business Day after Sellers' receipt of Purchaser's written
notice that a Tax liability to be indemnified has occurred (including
notification about the corresponding payment date and a copy of the underlying
Tax assessment or payment order), but in no case earlier than ten days before
the date at which the underlying Tax becomes due for payment. Purchaser shall
procure at Seller's cost that the Target Group Companies undertake
commercially reasonable efforts at Sellers' expense to achieve a deferred
payment date, in par- 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 50



ticular but not limited to the application for a suspension of enforcement of
tax payment obligation or equivalent application in foreign jurisdiction, to
the extent legally available, unless instructed otherwise by Sellers. If the
amount of Taxes for which an indemnification payment has been made is
subsequently reduced, the difference between the higher indemnification
payment and the lower amount of Taxes shall be reimbursed by Purchaser to
Sellers, including all interests after Taxes (net) related thereto. Section
7.4(c) and Section 10.10 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the existence of over
indemnification and the reimbursement obligation of Purchaser.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Any payments made pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be made free of any
withholding or deduction save where such withholding or deduction is required

|

Purchaser shall cause the Target Group Companies to file all Tax Returns which

Tax Returns for previous Tax periods of the respective Target Group Company
submitting such Tax Return, but only to the extent that the adopted policies,
procedures, practices and election rights are in compliance with Law. Any Tax
Return to be filed by Purchaser relating to a period beginning before the
Closing Date shall be subject to the review and prior written consent of
Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). Purchaser shall provide copies of any such Tax Return to Sellers no
later than sixty (60) days prior to the relevant due date of such Tax. Sellers
shall return its comments to Purchaser or the Target Group Companies within
thirty (30) days. If Sellers and Purchaser fail to reach an agreement on the
contents of the Tax Returns to be filed by Purchaser, the 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 51



Seller and Purchaser shall allow the issue to be resolved by an
internationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by the Seller and
Purchaser.

| 
---|---

the amendment or change is required by mandatory Law. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Purchaser shall provide complete copies of any Tax assessments relating to
time periods beginning on or before the Closing Date to Sellers without undue
delay.

|

Tax Proceedings 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify and keep Sellers informed
at each stage without undue delay of any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceedings that are announced or commenced and that might constitute
a basis for indemnification by Sellers pursuant to Section 7.1 (the "Tax
Proceedings"). Such notice shall be in writing, describe in reasonable detail
the object of the Tax Proceedings or the asserted Tax liability and include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in
respect of any such Tax Proceedings or asserted Tax liability.

A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 52



Sellers may conduct a Tax Proceeding on behalf of the relevant Target Group
Company by way of receiving a proper power of attorney from the respective
Target Group Company at Sellers' costs;

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

agreeing to the settlement or compromise of any Tax Proceeding and contesting
any Tax Proceeding before any court, tribunal or other appellate body, at
Sellers' costs; but 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

to the extent that any Taxes after Closing borne under this Agreement by the
Purchaser are, or may be, materially impacted by any action taken by Sellers
or their professional advisors pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii), Sellers shall
inform Purchaser of such proposed action and the parties agree to reasonably
cooperate and agree a reasonable approach to balance the interests of the
parties with respect to the conduct, settlement or compromise of any related
Tax Proceeding. 

Purchaser shall cooperate and cause the Target Group Companies and their
representatives to cooperate with Sellers (subject to Sellers reimbursement of
any material resulting expense) with respect to all Tax Proceedings to the
extent such cooperation measures are reasonable. On Sellers' request,
Purchaser shall in particular be responsible that Sellers obtains any document
or information, reasonably requested by Sellers, which may be useful for
Sellers to comply with their duty to prepare the respective Tax Returns
according to Section 7.2(a) and to avoid or mitigate any liability under this
Section 7 or to enforce a claim under this Section 7. In this respect,
Purchaser shall be obliged to procure that all relevant records and documents
which may be relevant for Taxes which may give rise to a Tax Claim under this
Agreement will be retained by the respective Target Company at least until the
respective Tax Claims are time barred (verjahrt).

statutory limitation period for the relevant Taxes. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If Purchaser fails to comply with any of its material covenants, obligations
or any other kind of commitment set forth in this Section 7, Sellers shall no
longer be liable under this Section 7 for the relevant Tax to the extent that
such failure to 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 53



comply adversely affects Sellers' ability to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 7.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Subject to Section 8.20 and 12.4, this Section 7 shall provide the sole remedy
for any Tax related matter, and for the avoidance of doubt Sections 10.2,

Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.

(including interest paid by the relevant Tax Authority, if any) received by a
Target Group Company for periods or portions thereof ending prior to or on the
Closing Date, including any set-off ("Tax Refund") to the extent such Tax
Refund has not reduced any Tax claim and was not taken into account in the
Closing Accounts. For the avoidance of doubt, Tax Benefits realized after the
Closing Date, for example from a step-up in basis or utilization of Tax losses
shall not be considered Tax Refunds.

| 
---|--- 

7.6

against any Taxes, damages or costs associated therewith which result from any
action or omission by Purchaser or by any of the Target Group Companies
performed after the Closing Date having a retroactive Tax effect on the
Sellers for periods prior to Closing Date (i) to the extent such damages and

Remedies 

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

Purchaser Claim 

In the event of any breach or non-fulfilment by Sellers of any of the Sellers
Warranties or any covenants given by the Sellers under this Agreement, except
for any Tax Warranties provided in Section 8.20, which are solely governed by
Section 7, (each a "Purchaser Claim"), Sellers shall be liable for putting
Purchaser or, at the election of Purchaser, Parent Guarantor or one or more of
the Target Group Companies into the same position that it would have been in
if the respective Seller Warranty had been correct and/or the respective
covenant of the Sellers had not been breached (Naturalrestitution), or, at the
election of Purchaser, for paying damages for non-performance (kleiner
Schadenersatz). For purposes of determining the liability of Sellers under any
Purchaser Claim for breach or non-fulfilment of any Seller Warranties,
Purchaser shall be entitled to recover (i) the actual, and reasonably
foreseeable damages and losses incurred by the Target Group Companies,
Purchaser or Parent Guarantor relating to the breach or non-fulfilment
(including actual and reasonably foreseeable losses, lost profits and
diminution in value arising from the breach or non-fulfilment); and (ii) all
reasonable incidental or internal costs and expenses incurred by the Target
Group Companies, Purchaser or Parent Guarantor including reasonable legal,
accounting or other professional fees and expenses related to or arising from
the relevant Purchaser Claim. All relevant losses shall be calculated on a
Euro-for-

include lost profits (entgangener Gewinn) but shall exclude any frustrated
expenses and consequential damages.

---|--- 

10.2

|

Notification of Purchaser Claim 

In the event of any alleged Purchaser Claim, Purchaser will give Sellers
written notice of the alleged breach or non-fulfilment of the respective
Seller Warranty or a covenant of the Sellers, with such notice stating the
nature thereof and the amount involved to the extent that such amount has been
determined at the time when such notice is given, as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any case within nine months after discovery of such breach
or non-fulfilment. Any delay in notification to the Sellers of a Purchaser
Claim within such nine months time period shall not relieve Sellers of their
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that such delay
shall have adversely prejudiced the ability of Sellers to defend the relevant
Purchaser Claim. Without prejudice to the validity of the Purchaser Claim or
alleged Purchaser Claim in question, Purchaser shall allow, and shall cause
the relevant Target Group Company to allow, Sellers and their professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstances alleged to give rise to
such Purchaser Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of such Purchaser Claim or alleged Purchaser Claim. For such purpose,
Purchaser shall give, and shall cause the Target Group Companies to give,
subject to them being paid their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
such information and assistance, including access to the Target Group
Companies' premises and personnel and including the right to examine and copy
or photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records, each during normal
business hours, as Sellers or their professional advisors may reasonably
request. Sellers agree that all information obtained under this Section 10.2
shall be treated as confidential information and in accordance with Section
12.1 below. No Purchaser Claim may be raised against Sellers, unless Sellers
have failed at their own costs to rectify the breach or circumstances
resulting in the respective Loss at no cost to Purchaser or any Target Group
Company within thirty (30) days of having received written notice of a
Purchaser Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, if and to the extent that any
Losses have not been so cured within the thirty (30) days period they shall be
recoverable by Purchaser under this Section 10.

Third Party Claims 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In the event that any action, claim, demand or proceeding with respect to
which Sellers may be liable under this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") is
asserted or announced by any third party (including any Governmental
Authority) against Purchaser or any Target Group Company (the "Claim
Addressee"), Purchaser shall inform Sellers about the Third Party Claim
without undue delay after becoming aware of the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Unless a shorter period is required by Law in order to respond to a Third
Party Claim, within 15 Business Days after being informed of the Third Party
Claim, the Sellers shall have the right to elect to defend the Claim Addressee
in connection with the Third Party Claim. In such event Sellers shall have the
right to defend 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 82



the Claim Addressee by all appropriate actions and shall have, at any time
during the proceedings, the sole power to direct and control such defence. In
particular, Sellers may participate in and direct all negotiations and
correspondence with the third party, appoint and instruct counsel and request
that the Third Party Claim be litigated or settled in accordance with Sellers'
instructions (provided that no settlement shall be entered into without
Purchaser's prior written consent if such settlement provides for any terms
other than the payment of money by Purchaser or the respective Target Group
Company). No action by Sellers or their representatives in connection with the
defence shall be construed as an acknowledgement (whether express or implied)
of a Purchaser Claim under this Agreement or of any underlying facts related
to such Purchaser Claim. In the event Sellers do not notify Purchaser of their
election to defend the Claim Addressee within the 15 Business Day period
referenced above, Purchaser shall be entitled to undertake the defence thereof
by counsel or other representative designated by it. To the extent that
Sellers are in breach of a representation, covenant or agreement, all costs
and expenses incurred by Sellers in defending the Third Party Claim shall be
borne by Sellers. If it turns out that Sellers were not in breach, any costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by Sellers in connection with the defence
(including advisors' fees) shall be borne by Sellers, provided, however, that
the respective Claim Addressee shall assign any and all claims for
reimbursement of cost (Kostenerstattungsanspruch) that it may have against any
third party with respect to the Third Party Claim to Sellers up to the amount
of costs which Sellers in fact incurred in respect of their defence of the
Third Party Claim.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Purchaser agrees, and shall cause any Target Group Company, (i) to fully
cooperate with, and assist Sellers in the defence of any Third Party Claim,
(ii) to diligently conduct the defence (to the extent that Sellers are not in
control of the defence) in order to keep the Loss as low as possible, (iii)
not to acknowledge or settle the Third Party Claim without Sellers' prior
written consent, (iv) subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions to
provide Sellers' representatives access, upon reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours, to all relevant books and records, other
information, premises (regardless of owned or leased) and personnel of any
Target Group Company, (v) to allow Sellers and its representatives to copy or
photograph any Assets, accounts, documents and records for the purpose of
avoiding, disputing, defending, appealing, compromising or contesting any
Third Party Claim or liability as Sellers or their professional ad- 

 





A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 83



visors may reasonably request, (vi) to deliver to Sellers without undue delay
copies of all relevant orders (Bescheide), decisions, filings, motions and
other documents of any court, authority or party to the conflict, and (vii) to
give Sellers reasonable opportunity to comment on and discuss with Purchaser
and any Target Group Company any measures which are necessary or appropriate
to take or to omit in connection with a Third Party Claim, and to comment on
and review any reports and documents and to participate in all relevant Tax
and social security audits, court hearings and any other meetings (it being
understood that subsections (ii) through (vii) above shall apply irrespective
of whether or not Sellers have elected to defend the Third Party Claim). Any
costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with the cooperation or
defence in accordance with this Section 10.8 shall be borne by Purchaser
and/or the Target Group Companies, except for any Losses to be indemnified by
Sellers under this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The failure of Purchaser to procure that any Claim Addressee complies with any
of its obligations under this Section 10.8, especially the failure to
carefully and diligently defend any Third Party Claim (e.g. by accepting a
judgment of default), shall release Sellers from its respective
indemnification obligations hereunder, except if (and to the extent) that the
Claim Addressee proves that Sellers are not prejudiced by such failure. 

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Sellers shall have no obligation to
compensate for any Loss in respect of a Third Party Claim under this Section
10.8 as long as the Sellers pursue to diligently defend the Third Party Claim
by means of all available appeal and not before the matter is subject to a
final non‑appealable decision or is otherwise settled.

| 
---|--- 

10.9

|

Exclusive Remedies 

The Parties are in agreement that the remedies that Purchaser or any Target
Group Company, may have against Sellers for breach of obligations set forth in
or in connection with this Agreement are solely governed by this Agreement,
and the remedies provided for by this Agreement shall be the exclusive
remedies available to Purchaser or any Target Group Company under and/or in
connection with this Agreement. Except as explicitly otherwise set forth in
this Agreement (i) any right of Purchaser to withdraw (zurucktreten) from this
Agreement or to require the winding up of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement (e.g. by way of großer Schadenersatz or Schadenersatz statt der
ganzen Leis-







A.Prot. 2014/125 CuS 84



tung), (ii) any claims for breach of pre-contractual obligations (culpa in
contrahendo), including but not limited to claims arising under Sections 241
(2), 311 (2) (3) German Civil Code (BGB) or ancillary obligations
(Nebenpflichten), including but not limited to claims arising under Sections
241 (2), 280 German Civil Code (BGB) (positive Forderungsverletzung, pFV),
(iii) any claims based on frustration of contract pursuant to Section 313
German Civil Code (BGB) (Storung der Geschaftsgrundlage), (iv) all remedies of
Purchaser for defects of the purchase object including but not limited to
claims arising under Sections 437 through 441 German Civil Code (BGB) are
hereby expressly excluded and waived (verzichtet) by Purchaser, except for
claims based on wilful deceit (arglistige Tauschung) or Sellers' own
intentional behaviour (Vorsatz).

| 
---|--- 

10.10

|

Tax Matters 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10 to the contrary, the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereto with respect to indemnification for any and
all Tax matters pursuant to Section 7 shall be governed solely by Section 7
and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 10, including,
without limitation Sections 10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, and 10.8.

| 
---|--- 

10.11

|

Survival 

No investigation by or knowledge of a Party or its representatives or
Affiliates, before or after the Closing, will affect in any manner any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of another Party set forth in
this Agreement or such Party's rights to rely thereon, and any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will survive any such
investigations or knowledge. Section 442 (1) German Civil Code (BGB) shall not
apply. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.11 shall not be deemed to
limit the fact that the Disclosure Materials are deemed to qualify each of the
Warranties.
