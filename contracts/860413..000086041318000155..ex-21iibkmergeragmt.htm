ARTICLE II

THE MERGER



2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, IIBK will merge with and into Purchaser Bank (the "Merger") at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
IIBK shall cease. Purchaser Bank shall be the surviving entity (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Bank") in the Merger
and shall continue to be governed by the MBA and its name and separate
existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.



2.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place by the
electronic (PDF), facsimile or overnight courier exchange of executed
documents or at a location and at a time as agreed to by the parties hereto on
the date designated by Purchaser within fifteen (15) days following
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or such later date as the parties
may otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").



2.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Purchaser Bank and IIBK
shall duly execute and deliver articles of merger (and such other documents as
required by law) to the MDOB and the IDF, to the extent required by the
relevant provision of the MBA and the IBA, respectively (collectively, the
"Articles of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Articles of Merger are duly filed with and endorsed by the MDOB or at such
later date or time as Purchaser Bank and IIBK agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").



2.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this
Agreement, in the MBA and the IBA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and 

subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser Bank shall
possess all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
IIBK and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of IIBK.
Additionally, all assets, rights, interests, privileges, powers, franchises
and property (real, personal and mixed) of IIBK shall be automatically
transferred to and vested in the Surviving Bank by virtue of the Merger
without any deed or other document of transfer. At the Effective Time, each
deposit account holder of Purchaser Bank or of IIBK immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become a depositor of the Surviving Bank. The main
banking office of the Surviving Bank shall be 401 North 31st Street, Billings,
Montana. The branch offices of Purchaser Bank and the branch offices of IIBK
that are in lawful operation prior to at the Effective Time shall be, and
shall be operated as, branch offices of the Surviving Bank.

2.5 Effect on Outstanding Shares of IIBK Common Stock.



(a) By virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, each share of IIBK Common Stock issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall become and be
converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Purchaser Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a
share of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be
issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of IIBK
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Closing Price.



(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock or any other authorized capital
stock of the Purchaser shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, or exchange of shares,
or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution paid, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of IIBK
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.



(d) As of the Effective Time, except for Dissenting Shares, each Excluded
Share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange
or payment shall be made with respect thereto. All shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that are held by IIBK, if any, other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, shall be canceled
and shall constitute authorized but unissued shares.

2.6 Dissenter's Rights. Each outstanding share of IIBK Common Stock, the
holder of which has perfected the right to dissent under the IBA and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder and shall be entitled only to such
rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the IBA. Each holder of a Dissenting Share shall be entitled to receive the
value of such Dissenting Share held 

by him in accordance with the applicable provisions of the IBA; provided, that
such holder complies with the procedures contemplated by and set forth in the
applicable provisions of the IBA. If any holder of any Dissenting Share shall
effectively withdraw or lose such holder's dissenter's rights under the
applicable provisions of the IBA, each such Dissenting Share shall be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

2.7 Exchange Procedures.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Co. (the "Exchange
Agent"), pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing, for the
benefit of the holders of record of shares of IIBK Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with
this Section 2.7, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(b), and Purchaser
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration.
Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") shall be mailed as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time to each holder of record of IIBK
Common Stock. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only
if the completed Letter of Transmittal is accompanied by one or more
Certificates representing IIBK Common Stock (or customary affidavits and, if
required by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.7(h), indemnification regarding
the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of
such Certificates) representing all shares of IIBK Common Stock to be
converted thereby.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and as to Dissenting Shares, shall
represent only the right to receive applicable payments as set forth in
Section 2.6. IIBK shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as specified herein.

(c) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate, or, at the election of
Purchaser, a statement reflecting shares issued in book entry form,
representing that number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and a check in the
amount equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares such holder is entitled
to pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled. Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. As soon as practicable following receipt of the properly completed
Letter of Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the
Exchange Agent shall distribute Purchaser Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided herein. The 

Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the
account of the Persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership
of any shares of IIBK Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of
IIBK, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if
the Certificates representing such IIBK Common Stock are presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable
judgment of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.



(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of Purchaser Common
Stock hereunder until such Person surrenders his or her Certificates in
accordance with this Section 2.7. Upon the surrender of such Person's
Certificates, such Person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective
Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Purchaser
Common Stock represented by such Person's Certificates.



(e) The stock transfer books of IIBK shall be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of IIBK of any shares of IIBK Common
Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Purchaser,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.7.



(f) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu of
fractions of a share pursuant to Section 2.5, any dividends or other
distributions to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.7 or any proceeds from any
investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the holders of IIBK Common Stock
for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent
to Purchaser upon the written request of Purchaser. After such request is
made, each holder of IIBK Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.7 shall look only to Purchaser for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of IIBK Common Stock such stockholder
holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any party to this Agreement (or any Affiliate thereof) shall be liable to
any former holder of IIBK Common Stock for any amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g) Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon IIBK's
stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. IIBK shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform its obligations as specified herein. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any
Certificate, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any
Merger 

Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party
and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.



(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.5.



2.8 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Purchaser and Purchaser Bank Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, and except as provided in Section 2.5(d), each share of
Purchaser Common Stock and each share of Purchaser Bank Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of common stock of the Purchaser and Purchaser Bank,
respectively, and shall not be affected by the Merger.



2.9 Directors of Surviving Bank After Effective Time. Immediately after the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified, the directors of the Surviving Bank shall consist of
the directors of Purchaser Bank serving immediately prior to the Effective
Time.



2.10 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation of
Purchaser Bank, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Bank until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law and the terms thereof. The bylaws of
Purchaser Bank, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Bank until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law and the terms of such bylaws.

shares of IIBK Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto ("IIBK Stock Option") pursuant to the Idaho Independent Bank
2004 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan and Idaho Independent Bank 2016 Long-Term
Equity Incentive Plan (together, the "IIBK Equity Plans") shall automatically
become vested and shall be cancelled and, subject to Purchaser's receipt of an
option surrender agreement in the form set forth in the Purchaser's Disclosure
Letter, converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, less
required withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of IIBK Common Stock subject to IIBK Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
amount by which the Option Payment Amount exceeds the exercise price of such
IIBK Stock Option. If the exercise price of a IIBK Stock Option is greater
than the Option Payment Amount, then at the Effective Time such IIBK Stock
Option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange therefor. Such
cash payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds on
the Closing Date.



2.12 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank may specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement be revised and the parties shall enter into such alternative
transactions as Purchaser or Purchaser Bank may reasonably 

determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that
such revised structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) adversely limit or
impact the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the IRC. In the event that Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank elects to make such a revision, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the revised structure.



2.13 Absence of Control. It is the intent of the parties hereto that
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed
(until consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control,
directly or indirectly, IIBK or to exercise, directly or indirectly, a
controlling influence over the management or policies of IIBK.



2.14 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Purchaser
or Purchaser Bank shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of IIBK or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, IIBK and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted
to Purchaser and Purchaser Bank an irrevocable power of attorney to execute
and deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
Purchaser or Purchaser Bank its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of IIBK or (b) otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank are authorized in the name of IIBK or otherwise to take any and
all such action.



2.15 Withholding. Purchaser or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of IIBK Common
Stock such amounts as Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of IIBK Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent.

of IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries, and no claim has been made in writing by
any authority in a jurisdiction where IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries do not
file tax returns that IIBK or any such Subsidiary is subject to taxation in
that jurisdiction. All Taxes, interest, additions and penalties due with
respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation relating
to IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid in full or adequate
provision has been made for any such Taxes on IIBK's statement of financial
condition (in accordance with GAAP). IIBK and its Subsidiaries have not
executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the
assessment or collection of any tax due that is currently in effect. IIBK and
each of its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party, and IIBK
and each of its Subsidiaries has timely complied with all applicable
information reporting requirements under Part III, Subchapter A of Chapter 61
of the IRC and similar applicable state and local information reporting
requirements. Neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments
and is not a party to any agreement, and does not maintain any plan, program
or arrangement, which could require it to make any payments that would not be
fully deductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the IRC.

licensing contract involving the payment of more than $100,000 per annum; or

(K) that is not of the type described in clauses (A) through (J) above and

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on IIBK. IIBK and each of its Subsidiaries has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under each IIBK Contract. To IIBK's Knowledge, each third-party counterparty
to each IIBK Contract has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by it under such IIBK Contract, and no event or
condition exists that constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
will constitute, a material default on the part of IIBK or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such IIBK Contract.

(iii) Neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under (and no
event has occurred that with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default under) or is in material violation of any provision of
any note, bond, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or
other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound or to which any
of its respective properties or assets is subject and, to the Knowledge of
IIBK, no other party to any such agreement (excluding any Loan or extension of
credit made by IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries) is in default in any respect
thereunder.



(p) Intellectual Property; IIBK IT Systems.



(i) IIBK and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses valid and binding
licenses and other rights to use (in the manner and the geographic areas in
which they are currently used) without payment all patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, trade names, service marks and trademarks material to its business.
IIBK's Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all
material trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights owned by or
licensed to IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries for use in its business, and all
licenses and other agreements relating thereto and all agreements relating to
third party intellectual property that IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries is
licensed or authorized to use in its business, including without limitation
any software licenses but excluding any so-called "shrink-wrap" license
agreements and other similar computer software licensed in the ordinary course
of business and/or otherwise resident on desktop computers (collectively, the
"IIBK Intellectual Property"). With respect to each item of IIBK Intellectual
Property owned by IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries, the owner possesses all
right, title and interest in and to the item, free and clear of any Lien. With
respect to each item of IIBK Intellectual Property that IIBK or any of its
Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, the license, sublicense or
agreement covering such item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect as to IIBK and its Subsidiaries. Neither IIBK nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice
alleging any interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation with or
of any intellectual property rights of a third party (including any claims
that IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any
intellectual property rights of a third party). To the Knowledge of IIBK,
neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or 

otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property rights of third
parties and no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property
rights of IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries.



(ii) To IIBK's Knowledge, all information technology and computer systems
(including software, information technology and telecommunication hardware and
other equipment) relating to the transmission, storage, maintenance,
organization, presentation, generation, processing or analysis of data and
information, whether or not in electronic format, used in or necessary to the
conduct of the business of IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"IIBK IT Systems") have been properly maintained by technically competent
personnel, in accordance with standards set by the manufacturers or otherwise
in accordance with standards in the industry, to ensure proper operation,
monitoring and use. IIBK IT Systems are in good working condition to
effectively perform all information technology operations necessary to conduct
IIBK's consolidated business as currently conducted. Neither IIBK nor any of
its Subsidiaries has experienced within the past two years any material
disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of its business
attributable to a defect, bug, breakdown or other failure or deficiency of
IIBK IT Systems. No Person has gained unauthorized access to any of IIBK IT
Systems that has had, or is reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on IIBK. IIBK and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to
provide for the back-up and recovery of the data and information necessary to
the conduct of their businesses without material disruption to, or material
interruption in, the conduct of their respective businesses. IIBK and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all data

employees, except for immaterial failures to comply or immaterial violations.

ever been bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization with
respect to its employees, nor is IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries the subject
of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or
seeking to compel it or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages and conditions of employment nor, to the Knowledge of

labor dispute or organizational effort involving IIBK or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of IIBK, threatened.

of IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL, any
Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in any IIBK
Benefit Plan, or any other party.

result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC.



(xiii)Neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a

(i) A list of all real property owned or leased by IIBK or a Subsidiary of
IIBK is set forth in IIBK's Disclosure Letter. IIBK and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all real property owned by it
(including any property acquired in a judicial foreclosure proceeding or by
way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar transfer), in each case free
and clear of any Liens except (i) liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and
(ii) such easements, restrictions and encumbrances, if any, as are not

the present use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby. With

that is leased rather than owned, neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default under the terms of any such lease.

(which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a

or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (2) that are on non-
accrual status, (3) that are classified as "Pass 5," "Special Mention,"
"Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss" or words of similar import, (4) that are
considered troubled debt restructurings or where the interest rate terms have
been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the
origination of the Loan due to concerns regarding the borrower's ability to
pay in accordance with the Loan's original terms and (5) where a specific
reserve allocation exists in connection therewith; and (C) all other assets
classified by IIBK as real estate acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of
foreclosure, including in-substance foreclosures, and all other assets

taken all actions required to exempt Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, the Agreement

their organizational documents, and the provisions of any federal or state
"anti-takeover," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
similar laws or regulations.

(y) Material Interests of Certain Persons. Except for deposit and loan
relationships entered into in the ordinary course of business, no current or

pertaining to the business of IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries.

(z) Insurance. In the opinion of management, IIBK and its Subsidiaries are
presently insured for amounts deemed reasonable by management against such
risks as companies engaged in a similar business, including engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would, in accordance with good
business practice, customarily be insured. IIBK's Disclosure Letter contains a
list of all policies of insurance carried and owned by IIBK or any of IIBK's

under such policies (other than with respect to health or disability
insurance).



(aa) Investment Securities; Derivatives.



(i) Except for restrictions that exist for securities that are classified as
"held to maturity," none of the investment securities held by IIBK or any of
its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to FHLB stock, is subject to any
restriction (contractual or statutory) that would materially impair the
ability of the entity holding such investment freely to dispose of such
investment at any time.

(ii) Neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or has agreed to
enter into an exchange-traded or over-the-counter equity, interest rate,
foreign exchange or other swap, forward, future, option, cap, floor or collar
or any other contract that is a derivative contract (including various
combinations thereof) or owns securities that (A) are referred to generically
as "structured notes," "high risk mortgage derivatives," "capped floating rate
notes" or "capped floating rate mortgage derivatives" or (B) are likely to
have changes in value as a result of interest or exchange rate changes that
materially exceed normal changes in value attributable to interest or exchange
rate changes.

(bb) Indemnification. Except as provided in the Articles of Incorporation or
bylaws of IIBK and the similar organizational documents of its Subsidiaries,
and in employment agreements, change in control agreements and other
agreements related to employment or service as a director, officer or
employee, neither IIBK nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
that provides for the indemnification of any of its present or former
directors, officers, employees or stockholders, or other persons who serve or
served as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership
or other enterprise at the request of IIBK and, to the Knowledge of IIBK,
there are no claims for which any such Person would be entitled to
indemnification under the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of IIBK or the
similar organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, under any
applicable law or regulation or under any such employment-related agreement.

(cc) Corporate Documents and Records. IIBK has previously provided a complete

their respective boards of directors (and each committee thereof) and their
stockholders.

(dd) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information Security. IIBK
has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most recent
examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. IIBK does not have
Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause IIBK or any
Subsidiary of IIBK: (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in
any material respect with the CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
or 

to be assigned a rating for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower
than "Satisfactory"; or (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be
in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
of customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation, in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by IIBK. To
the Knowledge of IIBK, no non-public customer information has been disclosed
to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause
either IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The
Board of Directors of IIBK (or, where appropriate, any Subsidiary of IIBK) has
adopted, and IIBK (or any Subsidiary of IIBK) has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA
PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in
all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder, and IIBK (or any Subsidiary of IIBK) has complied in
all material respects with any requirements to file reports and other
necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations
thereunder.

(ee) Internal Controls. IIBK and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal control over financial reporting sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization. There are no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect IIBK's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. To the Knowledge of IIBK, there has occurred no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in IIBK's internal controls over financial reporting.

(ff) Tax Treatment of the Merger. IIBK has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance relating to it that would prevent the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the IRC.

(gg) Related Party Transactions. IIBK's Disclosure Letter lists all instances
in which IIBK or any IIBK Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including
any loan or other credit accommodation) with any Affiliate of IIBK or any IIBK
Subsidiary where the amount exceeds $120,000. All such transactions involving
indebtedness (a) were made in the ordinary course of business, (b) were made
on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and







collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons, and (c) did not involve more than the normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features. No loan or credit
accommodation to any Affiliate of IIBK or any IIBK Subsidiary is presently in
default or, during the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement,
has been in default or has been restructured, modified or extended. Neither
IIBK nor any IIBK Subsidiary has been notified that principal or interest with
respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid when
due or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit
accommodation is inappropriate.

(hh) Trust Accounts. IIBK and each Subsidiary has properly administered all
accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary in all material respects, including
but not limited to accounts for which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian,
personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in
accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable laws and
regulations. Neither IIBK nor any other Subsidiary, nor has any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, committed any breach of trust
with respect to any such fiduciary account and the records for each such
fiduciary account.

(ii) No Other Representations or Warranties.

(i) Except for the representations and warranties made by IIBK in this Section
3.2, neither IIBK nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to IIBK, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and IIBK hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, neither IIBK nor any other Person makes or has made any

representatives with respect to (A) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to IIBK, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, or (B) except for the
representations and warranties made by IIBK in this Section 3.2, any oral or
written information presented to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or

exist that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of such capital
stock or any other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary, and there are no

any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to
the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Purchaser, or a Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a
"Purchaser Contract") and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries knows
of, or has received notice of, any material violation of the above by any of
the other parties thereto.

(ii) Each Purchaser Contract is valid and binding on Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries
has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by it under each Purchaser Contract. To the Knowledge of Purchaser,
each third-party counterparty to each Purchaser Contract has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it under such
Purchaser Contract, and no event or condition exists which constitutes or,
after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on
the part of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Purchaser
Contract.

(q) Labor Matters. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance
with all applicable laws respecting employment, retention of independent
contractors, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and
wages and hours. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever
been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or
labor organization with respect to its employees, nor is Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed
an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it or any such Subsidiary to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of employment
nor, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, has any such proceeding been threatened,
nor is there any strike, other labor dispute or organizational effort
involving Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened.

(r) Employee Benefit Plans.

(i)For purposes of this Agreement, "Purchaser Benefit Plans" mean all employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) ERISA), whether or not subject to
ERISA, whether funded or unfunded, and all pension, benefit, retirement,
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock-based,
performance award, phantom equity, incentive, deferred 

compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance, accrued leave, sick leave, vacation, paid time off, health,
medical, disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment, insurance,
welfare, fringe benefit and other similar plans, programs, policies, practices
or arrangements or other contracts or agreements (and any amendments thereto)
with respect to which Purchaser or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of
which together with Purchaser would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a "Purchaser ERISA Affiliate"), is a party
or that are sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be
contributed to by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any Purchaser ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current employee, officer, director,
consultant or independent contractor (or any spouse or dependent of such
individual) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any Purchaser ERISA
Affiliate.

(ii)Each Purchaser Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the IRC. Neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective
action or made a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the
DOL or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Purchaser Benefit
Plan, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of
any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.

(iii)With regard to each Purchaser Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC (the "Purchaser Qualified Plans"),
the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Purchaser Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been
revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred
that could adversely affect the qualified status of any Purchaser Qualified
Plan or the exempt status of the related trust or increase the costs relating
thereto. No trust funding any Purchaser Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the IRC.

(iv)With respect to each Purchaser Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412, 430 or 4971 of the IRC: (i) no such plan
is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the IRC, (ii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (iii) all premiums
to the PBGC have been timely paid in full, (iv) no liability (other than for
premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, and (v) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such Purchaser Benefit Plan.

(v)There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Purchaser's Knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against
Purchaser Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties
to Purchaser Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
Purchaser Benefit Plans, that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of 

Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL, any
Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in any Purchaser
Benefit Plan, or any other party.

(vi)To the Knowledge of Purchaser, none of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries nor
any Purchaser ERISA Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary,
has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the
IRC or Section 406 of ERISA) that could subject any of Purchaser Benefit Plans
or their related trusts, Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries, any Purchaser
ERISA Affiliate or any person that Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section
4975 of the IRC or Section 502 of ERISA.

(s) Properties. Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all real property owned by it (including any property acquired in a
judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
similar transfer), in each case free and clear of any Liens except (i) liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable and (ii) such easements, restrictions and
encumbrances, if any, as are not material in character, amount or extent, and
do not materially detract from the value, or materially interfere with the
present use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Each lease
pursuant to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee, leases real
or personal property is valid and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and
the Subsidiaries and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
Purchaser's Knowledge, any other party to any such lease, is in default or in
violation of any material provisions of any such lease. All real property
owned or leased by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are in all material
respects in a good state of maintenance and repair (normal wear and tear
excepted), conform in all material respects with all applicable ordinances,
regulations and zoning laws and are considered by Purchaser to be adequate for
the current business of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

(t) Loan Matters. All Loans held by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries were
made in all material respects for good, valuable and adequate consideration in
the ordinary course of the business, in accordance in all material respects
with sound banking practices and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the Loans are
not subject to any defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, including without
limitation any such as are afforded by usury or truth in lending laws, except
as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws or by general
principles of equity. The notes or other evidences of indebtedness evidencing
such Loans and all forms of pledges, mortgages and other collateral documents
and security agreements are, in all material respects, enforceable and valid.



(u) Anti-takeover Provisions Inapplicable. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have
taken all actions required to exempt Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, the Agreement
and the Merger from any provisions of an anti-takeover nature contained in
their organizational documents, and the provisions of any federal or state
"anti-takeover," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
similar laws or regulations.

(v) Corporate Documents and Records. Purchaser has previously made available a
complete and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation, bylaws and similar
organizational documents of Purchaser and each of Purchaser's Subsidiaries, as
in effect as of the 

date of this Agreement. Neither Purchaser nor any of Purchaser's Subsidiaries
is in violation of its Articles of Incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents. The minute books of Purchaser and each of
Purchaser's Subsidiaries constitute a complete and correct record of all
actions taken by their respective boards of directors (and each committee
thereof) and their stockholders.

(w) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information Security.
Purchaser Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most
recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Purchaser does
not have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Purchaser
Bank or any other Subsidiary of Purchaser: (i) to be deemed not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; or (ii) to
be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank
Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money
laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any
material respect with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations,
including without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by Purchaser Bank. To the Knowledge of
Purchaser, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or
accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause either
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The
Board of Directors of Purchaser Bank (or where appropriate of any other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has adopted, and Purchaser Bank (or such other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program
that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification
procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-
money laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of
Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and
Purchaser Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Purchaser) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.



(x) Internal Controls. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, and (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization. There are no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Purchaser's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there has 

occurred no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Purchaser's internal controls over
financial reporting.

(y) Tax Treatment of the Merger. Purchaser has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance relating to it that would prevent the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the IRC.

(z) Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of Purchaser has received the
opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed
by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Piper Jaffray and Co. to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions,
limitations and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration in
the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Purchaser.

(aa) Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in Purchaser's Disclosure
Letter, each of Purchaser's and its Subsidiaries' properties, the
Participation Facilities, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the Loan
Properties, are, and have been during the period of Purchaser's or its
Subsidiaries' ownership or operation thereof, in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws.

(bb) Insurance. In the opinion of management, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
are presently insured for amounts deemed reasonable by management against such
risks as companies engaged in a similar business, including engaging in the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, would, in accordance with good
business practice, customarily be insured. All of the insurance policies and
bonds maintained by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are in full force and
effect, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are not in default thereunder, all
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid and all
material claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

(cc) Intellectual Property; Purchaser IT Systems.

(i) Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses valid and
binding licenses and other rights to use (in the manner and the geographic
areas in which they are currently used) without payment all patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, service marks and trademarks material
to its business. With regard to all material trademarks, trade names, service
marks and copyrights owned by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
its business, and all licenses and other agreements relating thereto and all
agreements relating to third party intellectual property that Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use in its business,
including without limitation any software licenses but excluding any so-called
"shrink-wrap" license agreements and other similar computer software licensed
in the ordinary course of business and/or otherwise resident on desktop
computers (collectively, the "Purchaser Intellectual Property"), the owner
possesses all right, title and interest in and to the item, free and clear of
any Lien. With respect to each item of Purchaser Intellectual Property that
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, the
license, sublicense or agreement covering such item is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and the Subsidiaries.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any 

charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation with or of any intellectual
property rights of a third party (including any claims that Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any intellectual
property rights of a third party). To the Knowledge of Purchaser, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property
rights of third parties and no third party has interfered with, infringed
upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual
property rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) To Purchaser's Knowledge, all information technology and computer
systems (including software, information technology and telecommunication
hardware and other equipment) relating to the transmission, storage,
maintenance, organization, presentation, generation, processing or analysis of
data and information, whether or not in electronic format, used in or
necessary to the conduct of the business of Purchaser or First Interstate Bank
(collectively, "Purchaser IT Systems") have been properly maintained by
technically competent personnel, in accordance with standards set by the
manufacturers or otherwise in accordance with standards in the industry, to
ensure proper operation, monitoring and use. Purchaser IT Systems are in good
working condition to effectively perform all information technology operations
necessary to conduct Purchaser's consolidated business as currently conducted.
Neither Purchaser nor Purchaser Bank has experienced within the past two years
any material disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of its
business attributable to a defect, bug, breakdown or other failure or
deficiency of Purchaser IT Systems. No Person has gained unauthorized access
to any of the Purchaser IT Systems that has had, or is reasonably expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Purchaser and Purchaser Bank
have taken reasonable measures to provide for the back-up and recovery of the
data and information necessary to the conduct of their businesses without
material disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of their
respective businesses. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all data protection and privacy laws and regulations as
well as their own policies relating to data protection and the privacy and
security of personal data and the non-public personal information of their
respective customers and employees, except for immaterial failures to comply
or immaterial violations.

(dd) No Other Representations or Warranties.

(i) Except for the representations and warranties made by Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank in this Section 3.3, neither Purchaser, Purchaser Bank nor any
other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, their Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and Purchaser and Purchaser Bank hereby disclaim any
such other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, neither Purchaser, Purchaser Bank nor any other Person
makes or has made any representation or warranty to IIBK or any of its
Affiliates or representatives with respect to (A) any financial projection,
forecast, estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Purchaser,
Purchaser Bank any of their Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, or

Purchaser Bank in this Section 3.3, any oral 

or written information presented to IIBK or any of its Affiliates or
representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the
course of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(ii) Purchaser and Purchaser Bank hereby acknowledge and agree that neither
IIBK nor any other Person has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty other than those contained in Section 3.2.

not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Subsidiaries' officers, directors or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, induce or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries, offers discussions or the making of any proposal that constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
furnish any confidential or non-public information or data regarding IIBK or
any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to any such information or data to
any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an
inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations, or otherwise communicate in any way with any
Person (other than Purchaser and Purchaser Bank), regarding an Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (v)
release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which IIBK is a party or (vi) enter into or consummate any
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, arrangement or
understanding contemplating any Acquisition Proposal or requiring IIBK to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director or
employee of IIBK or any of the Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.1 by IIBK. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption and approval
of this Agreement by IIBK's stockholders at the IIBK Stockholder Meeting, this
Section 5.1(a) shall not prohibit IIBK from furnishing non-public information
regarding IIBK and its Subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions with, any
Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to IIBK by
such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (2) IIBK has not
breached any of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.1, (3) IIBK's Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
violate the directors' fiduciary obligations to IIBK's stockholders under
applicable law, and (4) prior to furnishing any non-public information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Person, IIBK gives Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank written notice of the identity of such Person and of IIBK's
intention to furnish non-public information to, or enter into discussions
with, such Person and IIBK receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such Person than the
confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and IIBK is to Purchaser. 



(b) IIBK will notify Purchaser orally within one (1) business day and in
writing (within two (2) business days) of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
any request for non-public information that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, including, in each
case, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the request
or inquiry and the terms and conditions thereof, and shall provide to
Purchaser any written materials received by IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith. IIBK will keep Purchaser informed of any developments
with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry promptly
orally (within one (1) calendar day) and in writing (within two (2) calendar
days) upon the occurrence thereof.



(c) IIBK will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.

5.2 Advice of Changes. Prior to the Closing, IIBK, on the one hand, and
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the
other party orally and in writing to the extent that it has Knowledge of (i)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to
comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

5.3 Access and Information.



(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, on the one
hand, and IIBK, on the other hand, for purposes of verifying the
representations and warranties of the other and preparing for integration of
the parties and other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall (and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the other party and its
representatives (including, without limitation, officers and employees of the
other party and its Affiliates and counsel, accountants and other
professionals retained by the other party) such reasonable access during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the
books, records, contracts, properties, personnel, information technology
services and to such other information relating to the other party and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested, except where such materials
relate to (i) matters involving this Agreement, (ii) pending or threatened
litigation or investigations if, in the opinion of counsel, the presence of
such designees would or might adversely affect the confidential nature of, or
any privilege relating to, the matters being discussed, (iii) matters
involving an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) confidential supervisory
information; provided, however, that no investigation pursuant to this Section
5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in
this Agreement. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its 

customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the entity in
possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make
appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, IIBK shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, promptly provide to Purchaser Bank (i) a copy
of each report filed with a Governmental Entity, (ii) a copy of each periodic
report provided to its senior management and all materials relating to its
business or operations furnished to its Board of Directors, (iii) a copy of
each press release made available to the public and (iv) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may be reasonably
requested, provided that Purchaser Bank shall not be entitled to receive
reports or other documents relating to (w) matters involving this Agreement,
(x) pending or threatened litigation or investigations if, in the opinion of
counsel, the disclosure of such information would or might adversely affect
the confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being
discussed, (y) matters involving an Acquisition Proposal or (z) confidential
supervisory information.



(c) IIBK, Purchaser and Purchaser Bank will not, and will cause its respective
representatives not to, use any information and documents obtained in the
course of the consideration of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 5.3, for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will hold such information and
documents in confidence and treat such information and documents as secret and
confidential and to use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the
confidentiality of such information and documents.

(d) From and after the date hereof, representatives of Purchaser, Purchaser
Bank and IIBK shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the
conversion of IIBK's data processing and related electronic informational
systems to those used by Purchaser Bank with the goal of conducting such
conversion as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Merger.



(e) Within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each calendar month, IIBK
shall provide Purchaser Bank with an updated list of Loans described in
Section 3.2(w)(vi).



(f) The information regarding IIBK and its Subsidiaries to be supplied by IIBK
for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any filings or approvals under
applicable state securities laws, or any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule
425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The information supplied, or to be supplied, by IIBK for
inclusion in applications to Governmental Entities to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate in all
material respects. 





(g) The information regarding Purchaser, Purchaser Bank and their Subsidiaries
to be supplied by Purchaser and Purchaser Bank for inclusion in the
Registration Statement, any filings or approvals under applicable state
securities laws, or any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the
Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement-Prospectus will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The information supplied, or to be supplied, by
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank for inclusion in applications to Governmental
Entities to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be accurate in all material respects. The Registration
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.



5.4 Applications; Consents.



(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file within forty-five (45) days after
the date hereof, all necessary applications, notices and filings to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities
that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The parties hereto shall furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective Subsidiaries' directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
application, notice or filing made by or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser
Bank, IIBK or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser,
Purchaser Bank and IIBK shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on, all the information
relating to Purchaser, Purchaser Bank and IIBK, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity pursuant to this
Section 5.4(a).



(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, each of the parties hereto
shall, and they shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization or approval of
any third party that is required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(c) Purchaser, Purchaser Bank and IIBK shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such required consent or approval will be materially delayed.







5.5 Anti-Takeover Provisions. IIBK and its Subsidiaries shall take all steps
required by any relevant federal or state law or regulation or under any
relevant agreement or other document to exempt or continue to exempt
Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, the Agreement and the Merger from any provisions of
an anti-takeover nature in IIBK's or its Subsidiaries' Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, or similar organizational documents, and the
provisions of any federal or state anti-takeover laws.



5.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to do promptly,
or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible,
including using efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
extensions, waivers, consents and approvals from all applicable Governmental
Entities, effecting all necessary registrations, applications and filings
(including, without limitation, filings under any applicable state securities
laws) and obtaining any required contractual consents and regulatory
approvals.



5.7 Publicity. The initial press release announcing this Agreement shall be a
joint press release. Thereafter, IIBK and Purchaser shall consult with each
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
statements (including any written communications to stockholders) with respect
to the Merger and any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any
party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems necessary to satisfy
such party's disclosure obligations imposed by law.



5.8 Stockholder Meeting.



(a) IIBK will submit to its stockholders this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved or adopted by stockholders to carry out the intentions
of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, IIBK will take, in
accordance with applicable law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "IIBK Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as practicable
to consider and vote on approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.8(b), IIBK
shall, (i) through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders
adoption and approval of this Agreement, (ii) include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain from its stockholders a vote approving and adopting this Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the IIBK Stockholder Meeting, IIBK's Board of Directors may, if it
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw or modify or change in
a manner adverse to Purchaser its recommendation that the stockholders of IIBK
approve this Agreement (a "Change of Recommendation"); provided that prior to
any such Change of Recommendation, IIBK shall have complied in all material
respects with 

Section 5.1, given Purchaser and Purchaser Bank written notice promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advising it of the decision of
IIBK's Board of Directors to take such action and, if the decision relates to
an Acquisition Proposal, given Purchaser and Purchaser Bank the material terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including the identity
of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal; and provided, further,
that if the decision relates to an Acquisition Proposal: (i) IIBK shall have
given Purchaser and Purchaser Bank three (3) Business Days after delivery of
such notice to Purchaser and Purchaser Bank to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and if Purchaser and Purchaser
Bank propose to revise the terms of this Agreement, IIBK shall have negotiated
in good faith with Purchaser and Purchaser Bank with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal; and (ii) IIBK's Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed
to by Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. If IIBK's Board of Directors does not make
the determination that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and thereafter determines not to withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation that the stockholders of IIBK approve this Agreement in
connection with a new Acquisition Proposal, the procedures referred to above
shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal,
modification or change. In the event of any material revisions to the
Acquisition Proposal that result in terms that are less favorable to IIBK,
IIBK shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank and to again comply with the requirements of this Section
5.8(b) with respect to such new written notice, except that the three (3)
Business Day period referred to above shall be reduced to two (2) Business
Days. In addition to the foregoing, IIBK shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.



5.9 Registration of Purchaser Common Stock.



(a) Within forty-five (45) days following the date hereof, Purchaser shall
prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC. The Registration
Statement shall contain proxy materials relating to the matters to be
submitted to IIBK stockholders at the IIBK Stockholders Meeting and shall also
constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger (such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments
or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). IIBK will furnish
to Purchaser the information required to be included in the Registration
Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to
review and consult with Purchaser and approve the form of, and any
characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and
to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. IIBK will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed
to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser will
advise IIBK, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by 

the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Purchaser or IIBK, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by Purchaser or IIBK that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement-Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed by Purchaser with the SEC
and disseminated by IIBK to the stockholders of IIBK.



(b) Purchaser shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each of
IIBK and Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders
of IIBK Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall notify or file an application
with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC for the additional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued by Purchaser in exchange for the shares of IIBK Common
Stock.



5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice to
the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other communication relating to,
a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract material to
the financial condition, properties, businesses or results of operations of
each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or
occurrence that individually or in the aggregate has, or that, so far as
reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of IIBK, Purchaser and Purchaser
Bank shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.



(a) Purchaser shall honor IIBK Benefit Plans set forth in IIBK's Disclosure
Letter in accordance with the terms of such IIBK Benefit Plans, except to the
extent an alternative treatment is set forth in this Section 5.11 or in
Section 2.11 of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of all Persons who are employees of IIBK and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is
not specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing
Employee") that, in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee
benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; 

provided, however, in no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to
participate in any frozen plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

(b) At the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser may maintain IIBK's health
and welfare plans through the end of the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser determines to
terminate one or more of IIBK's health and/or welfare plans, then, at the
request of Purchaser made at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective
Time, IIBK shall adopt resolutions, to the extent required, providing that one
or more of IIBK's health and welfare plans (excluding any plans that are
mutually agreed to in writing between the parties) will be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (or such later date as
requested by Purchaser in writing or as may be required to comply with any
applicable advance notice or other requirements contained in such plans) and
shall arrange for termination of all corresponding insurance policies, service
agreements and related arrangements effective on the same date to the extent
not prohibited by the terms of such arrangements or applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees
or their dependents shall terminate under any of IIBK's health and welfare
plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as
applicable, become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and
benefits common to all employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their
dependents and, consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in
coverage. Continuing Employees who become covered under health plans, programs
and benefits of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid under IIBK's health plan for the plan
year in which coverage commences under Purchaser's health plan and shall not
be subject to any pre-existing conditions under any such plans. Terminated
IIBK employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Purchaser in accordance with the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Benefit Plan in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual under the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan for 2019 employer contributions) under the Purchaser Benefit Plans the
service of such employees with IIBK to the same extent as such service was
credited for such purpose by IIBK; provided, however, that such service shall
not be recognized: (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits under any of the Purchaser Benefit Plans or (ii) to
the extent, at the sole discretion of Purchaser, the cash value of unused paid
time-off is paid to Continuing Employees at the Effective Time. The value of
each IIBK employee's unused paid time-off is set forth in IIBK's Disclosure
Letter. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of
Purchaser to terminate the employment of any IIBK employee or to review any
employee benefit plan or program from time to time and to make such changes
(including terminating any such plan or program) as Purchaser deems
appropriate.

(d) IIBK shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause IIBK 401(k)
Plan to be frozen as to future contributions effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time and Purchaser shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to allow the Continuing Employees to participate in Purchaser's 401(k)
Plan on the first day immediately following the Effective Time. 

Alternatively, if requested in writing by Purchaser no later than thirty (30)
days prior to Closing, IIBK will also take all necessary steps to terminate
IIBK 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and if further requested, shall prepare and
submit a request to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on
termination. If Purchaser requests that IIBK apply for a favorable
determination letter, then prior to the Effective Time, IIBK shall take all
such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to
submit the application for favorable determination letter in advance of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its best
efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter as
promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
IIBK 401(k) Plan as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance
of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective Time, IIBK, and
following the Effective Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to IIBK
401(k) Plan to effect the provisions of this Section 5.11(d). In the event
Purchaser requests IIBK to submit an application to the IRS for a
determination letter, IIBK 401(k) Plan participants who are terminated at or
after the Closing, but prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter,
may elect to receive a distribution from IIBK 401(k) Plan upon termination of
their employment. Purchaser shall take any and all actions as may be required
to permit Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances in IIBK's
401(k) Plan into Purchaser's 401(k) Plan.



(e) Purchaser agrees that each full-time IIBK employee who is involuntarily
terminated by Purchaser (other than for "Cause" as determined by Purchaser)
within six months following the Effective Time and who is not covered by a
separate severance, change in control or employment agreement shall, upon
executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by
Purchaser, receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the
rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at IIBK, with
a minimum equal to four weeks of base pay and a maximum equal to fifty-two
(52) weeks, as determined in accordance with Purchaser's severance policy, as
set forth in Purchaser\'s Disclosure Letter. For purposes of calculating the
number of years of service, fractional years of service shall be rounded up or
down to the nearest full month. For purposes of calculating base pay, IIBK
employees who are paid on an hourly basis shall be deemed to have a base pay
equal to the employee's average weekly compensation over the two months prior
to the termination date; provided that, in no event shall an employee's base
pay for this purpose be less than the employee's base pay with IIBK as in
effect immediately prior to Closing. For employees whose compensation is
determined in whole or in part on the basis of commission income, "base pay"
shall include base salary or total hourly wages paid plus commissions earned
during the most recent twelve (12) months ended as of the date of termination
of employment. Purchaser will offer IIBK employees whose jobs are eliminated
as a result of the Merger priority in applying for open positions within
Purchaser or Purchaser Bank. Any employee of IIBK who has or is a party to any
employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment that may be
triggered by a termination, including a termination following the Merger,
shall not receive the severance benefits as provided in this Section but will
receive the payment specified in such agreement or arrangement.





(f) Purchaser shall honor and maintain all obligations under the employment
agreements, the IIBK Second Amended and Restated Executive Non-Qualified
Retirement Plan and associated Plan Agreements, IIBK Amended and Restated
Deferred Compensation Agreement with Jack W. Gustavel, IIBK Second Amended and
Restated 2005 Deferred Compensation Agreement with Jack W. Gustavel and Model
Rabbi Trust Agreement, each as set forth in IIBK's Disclosure Letter, except
to the extent any such agreement is superseded, with the consent of the
beneficiary, as of, or following, the Effective Time. Purchaser specifically
agrees to assume the IIBK Second Amended and Restated Executive Non-Qualified
Retirement Plan, IIBK Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Agreement
with Jack W. Gustavel, IIBK Second Amended and Restated 2005 Deferred
Compensation Agreement with Jack W. Gustavel and Model Rabbi Trust Agreement
(collectively, the "Non-Qualified Plans") and the timing and amount of the
benefits that accrue and the payments thereunder will continue to be made in
accordance with the terms of the Non-Qualified Plans.



(g) Purchaser shall establish a retention bonus pool in the amount as provided
in Purchaser Disclosure Letter for employees of IIBK and its Subsidiaries
jointly designated in writing by Purchaser and IIBK (other than employees of
IIBK who are subject to employment contracts or other contracts providing for
severance) to help retain key employees; provided, that any retention bonus
pool payment is not considered an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the IRC or results in any other adverse tax
consequence to the Purchaser. The amount and payment date of the retention
bonus for each such employee shall be jointly determined in writing by
Purchaser and IIBK, but in the aggregate shall equal the amount provided in
Purchaser Disclosure Letter assuming all such key employees remain with the
Purchaser or an Affiliate to such date or are involuntarily terminated without
cause prior to that date.



(h) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser, Purchaser
Bank and IIBK shall enter into settlement agreements with Jack Wynn Gustavel
and Kurt Gustavel to be effective as of the Effective Time, as provided in
Purchaser Disclosure Letter.



(i) Purchaser shall provide all employees of IIBK and its Subsidiaries whose
employment was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or
following the Effective Time, and who so desires, job counseling and
outplacement assistance services, in which it shall assist such employees in
locating new employment and shall notify all such employees who want to be so
notified of opportunities for positions with Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries for which Purchaser reasonably believes such persons are
qualified and shall consider any application for such positions submitted by
such persons, provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any
such person shall be made in the sole discretion of Purchaser.



(j) IIBK shall take all such actions as Purchaser may reasonably request to
fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of both federal Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN Act") and any state-
specific WARN Act statutes, including providing notices to IIBK's employees.



5.12 Indemnification.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
IIBK or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and any person
who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of IIBK, any of its
Subsidiaries, or the IIBK Benefit Plans or any of their respective

provided further, that Purchaser may (i) request that IIBK obtain an extended
reporting period endorsement under IIBK's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor "tail" policies the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
in any material respect to such Person than IIBK's existing insurance policies
as of the date hereof.

merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such successor
and assign of Purchaser and its successors and assigns assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.12.



(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
representatives.



(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 5.12 are
subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(k)) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (12 C.F.R.
Part 359).

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION



7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger abandoned,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the
Board of Directors of the terminating party, either before or after any
requisite stockholder approval:



(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and IIBK; or



(b) by either Purchaser or IIBK, in the event of the failure of IIBK's
stockholders to approve the Agreement at IIBK Stockholder Meeting; provided,
however, that IIBK shall only be entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant
to this clause if it has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under Section 5.8 (subject to Section 5.8(b));

(c) by either Purchaser or IIBK, if either (i) any approval, consent or waiver
of a Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied and such denial has
become final and non-appealable or (ii) any court or other Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final, unappealable order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) by either Purchaser or IIBK, if the Merger is not consummated by May 31,
2019, unless the failure to so consummate by such time is due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(e) by either Purchaser or IIBK (provided that the party seeking termination
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), in the event of a breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of the other party shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and (b) or
Sections 6.3(a) and (b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied and such
breach or untrue representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured
within thirty (30) days following 

written notice to the party committing such breach or making such untrue
representation or warranty;

(f) by Purchaser, if (i) IIBK shall have breached its obligations under
Section 5.1 or Section 5.8 in any material respect or (ii) if the Board of
Directors of IIBK does not publicly recommend in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus that stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement or if, after
recommending in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus that stockholders approve and
adopt this Agreement, the Board of Directors effects a Change of
Recommendation;

(g) by IIBK, at any time prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement
by IIBK's stockholders, to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, but only if (i) IIBK's Board of Directors has determined in good
faith based on the advice of legal counsel that failure to take such action
would cause the Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (ii) IIBK has not breached its obligations under Section
5.1.

(h) by IIBK, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (the "Purchaser Ratio") shall be less than 0.80; and

(ii) the Purchaser Ratio shall be less than the number obtained by subtracting
0.20 from the Index Ratio (as defined below);

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If IIBK elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), it shall give written
notice to Purchaser (provided that such notice of election to terminate may be
withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day period). During the
five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall
have the option to increase the consideration to be received by the holders of
IIBK Common Stock and IIBK Stock Options hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange
Ratio (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) to equal a quotient of (A)
the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio, divided by (B)
the Average Closing Price. If Purchaser so elects within such five-day period,
it shall give prompt written notice to IIBK of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 7.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this Section 7.1(h) the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

"Final Index Price" shall means the average closing price of the KBW Regional
Banking index as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (as reported at
www.nasdaq.com) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and
including the Determination Date.

"Index Price" shall mean $112.11, which is the closing price on the Starting
Date for the KBW Regional Banking Index (as reported on www.nasdaq.com).

"Index Ratio" shall mean the Final Index Price divided by the Index Price. 

"Starting Date" shall mean the third trading day prior to entry into this
Agreement.

"Starting Price" shall mean $45.68, which is the closing price of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (as reported on
www.nasdaq.com) on the Starting Date.

7.2 Termination Fee; Expenses.

7.1(g), IIBK shall make payment to Purchaser of a termination fee of
$6,834,075.



(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), so long as at the time of such termination Purchaser is not in
material breach of any representation, warranty or material covenant contained
herein, IIBK shall make payment to Purchaser of a termination fee of
$6,834,075.

giving rise to such termination was knowing or intentional, and (ii) at the
time of such termination Purchaser or Purchaser Bank is not in material breach
of any representation, warranty or material covenant contained herein, and
(iii) prior to the IIBK Stockholder Meeting (in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)) or the date of termination (in the case of

publicly announced, disclosed or communicated and (iv) within twelve (12)
months of such termination IIBK shall consummate or enter into any agreement
with respect to the Acquisition Proposal set forth in clause (iii) of this
Section 7.2(c), then IIBK shall make payment to Purchaser of a termination fee
of $6,834,075.



(d) The fee payable pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or (b) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds at the time of termination. Any fee
payable pursuant to Section 7.2(c) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after notice of
demand for payment. IIBK, Purchaser Bank and Purchaser acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Purchaser and Purchaser Bank would not enter into this Agreement.

liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole remedy of Purchaser
and Purchaser Bank in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases
specified in such sections.



7.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Purchaser or IIBK as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and, subject to Section 7.2, have no effect, and there
shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective
officers and directors, except that (i) Sections 5.3(c), 7.2 and 8.6 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful

a result of an unauthorized disclosure; (b) information that was in the
Shareholder's possession prior to the date of this Agreement or information

contractual or fiduciary obligation; or (c) information that was independently

1 For Director Jerald J. Jaeger's voting agreement only, the following
language will be added: "(and Shareholder shall use his reasonable best
efforts to cause any shares of Common Stock held by the Koontenai Tribe of
Idaho to) 

 

frustrate the purposes of or adversely affect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger;
provided, that the foregoing applies solely to the Shareholder in his or her
capacity as a shareholder and, Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding
in this Agreement in Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of IIBK
or any of its subsidiaries (if Shareholder holds such office), and nothing in
this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by
Shareholder in Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer, including
in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or
omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement; or (b) will be construed
to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder from exercising Shareholder's
fiduciary duties as an officer or director to IIBK or its shareholders. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply to any Shares held by
any trust, limited partnership or other entity holding Shares for which the
Shareholder serves in any partner, shareholder or trustee capacity. To the
extent the Shareholder does not control, by himself or herself, the
determinations of such shareholder entity, the Shareholder agrees to exercise
all voting or other determination rights such Shareholder has in such
shareholder entity to carry out the intent and purposes of his, her or its
support and voting obligations in this paragraph and otherwise set forth in
this Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for this
Agreement, such Shareholder (x) has not entered into, and shall not enter into
during the Support Period, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect
to the Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not grant during the Support
Period, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Shares
except any proxy to carry out the intent of this Agreement. The Shareholder
agrees not to enter into any agreement or commitment with any person the
effect of which would be inconsistent with or otherwise violate the provisions
and agreements set forth herein.

encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary
disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or
involuntarily, enter into any swap or other arrangements that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of, enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with
respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation
or other disposition of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation
of law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of the Shares, or
any interest therein, including the right to vote any Shares, as applicable (a
"Transfer"); provided, that the Shareholder may (i) Transfer Shares pursuant
to any currently existing pledge agreement or for estate planning or
philanthropic purposes so long as the transferee, prior to the date of
Transfer, agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and comply with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Shareholder provides at least two (2)
days' prior written notice (which shall include the written consent of the
transferee agreeing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this
Agreement), in which case the Shareholder shall remain jointly and severally
liable for any breach of this Agreement by such transferee, (ii) bequeath
Shares by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind
the transferee, (iii) surrender Shares to IIBK in connection with the vesting,

give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the Shares

of his or her obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees,
without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional

IIBK to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in connection

with the Merger, the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and

Entire Agreement; Assignment. The recitals are incorporated as a part of this
Agreement. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and

employment, non-competition, non-solicit or consulting agreement between the
Shareholder and either the Purchaser, Purchaser Bank or IIBK or its
affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto; provided,
however, that the rights under this Agreement are assignable by Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank to a majority-owned affiliate or any successor-in-interest of
Purchaser or Purchaser Bank, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank of their obligations hereunder.

Remedies/Specific Enforcement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that this
Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that Purchaser and Purchaser Bank would be
irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with its specific terms and that monetary damages
would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to
which Purchaser or Purchaser Bank may be entitled (including monetary
damages), Purchaser and Purchaser Bank shall be entitled to seek injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the Shareholder
hereby waives any defense in any action for specific performance or an
injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be adequate.
The Shareholder further agrees that neither Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, nor any
other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond
or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives
any right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any

(b) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
