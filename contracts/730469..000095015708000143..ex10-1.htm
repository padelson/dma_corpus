"FX Contracts"). Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall maintain the FX Contracts
for their duration, including paying any notional amounts due or receiving

showing all notional amounts paid and received under each of the FX Contracts

(iii) During the 30 day period following Parent's receipt of the Statement,
Parent and its accountants shall be permitted to review the working papers of

release letters reasonably requested by Buyer's accountants in
connection therewith. During the 30 day period following Parent's receipt of
the FX Statement, Parent shall be permitted to review the books and records
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries relating to the FX Statement. The
Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the 30th day
following delivery thereof to Parent, unless Parent gives written notice of

prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall be signed by Parent and

asserted, (B) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or

Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the 30th day
following delivery thereof to Parent, unless Parent gives written notice of

Buyer prior to such date. Any FX Notice of Disagreement shall be signed by
Parent and shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted, (B) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on the FX Amount being incorrectly calculated
and (C) specify what Parent reasonably believes is the correct FX Amount
based on the disagreements set forth in the FX Notice of Disagreement,
including a reasonably detailed description of the adjustments applied to the
FX Statement in calculating such amount. If the Notice of Disagreement or the
FX Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, is received in a timely manner,
then the Statement or the FX Statement, as applicable (as revised in
accordance with this sentence), shall become final and binding upon Buyer and
Parent on the earlier of (A) the date Buyer and Parent resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or the FX Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, or (B) the date
any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
During the 30 day periods following

the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement and the FX Notice of Disagreement,
Buyer and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement or the FX Notice of Disagreement, as applicable.
During the 30 day period following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement,
Buyer and its accountants shall have access to the working papers of Parent
prepared in connection with the Notice of Disagreement; provided that
Buyer and its advisors, including its accountants, shall have executed all
release letters reasonably requested by Parent's accountants in
connection therewith. At the end of such 30 day periods, Buyer and Parent
shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm")
for resolution any matters that remain in dispute and which were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement and the FX Notice of Disagreement, in
the form of a written brief. The Accounting Firm shall be KPMG or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other internationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Parent and
Buyer in writing. Buyer and Parent shall jointly instruct the Accounting
Firm that it (i) shall review only the matters that were properly included in
the Notice of Disagreement and the FX Notice of Disagreement and which
remain unresolved, (ii) shall make its determination in accordance with
the requirements of this Section 2(g) and (iii) shall render its
decision within 30 days from the submission of such matters. Judgment may
be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this Section 2(g) shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by Buyer.

 

 

The fees, costs and expenses of Parent incurred in connection with its review
of the Statement, its preparation and certification of any Notice of
Disagreement, its review of the FX Statement, its preparation and
certification of any FX Notice of Disagreement and its preparation of any
written brief submitted to the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Parent, and
the fees, costs and expenses of Buyer incurred in connection with its
preparation of the FX Statement, its review of any FX Notice of Disagreement,
its preparation of the Statement, its review of any Notice of Disagreement
and its preparation of any written brief submitted to the Accounting Firm
shall be borne by Buyer.

 

 

(iv) The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

 

(A) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Working Capital
Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by the sum of (I)
the amount by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Working
Capital Amount minus (II) the Positive Initial Adjustment (if any) plus (III)
the Negative Initial Adjustment (if any), or decreased by the absolute value
of such sum if such sum is a negative amount,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(B) if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Minimum Working Capital
Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be decreased by the sum of (I)
the amount by which the Minimum Working Capital Amount exceeds the Closing
Working Capital minus (II) the Negative Initial Adjustment (if any) plus
(III) the Positive Initial Adjustment (if any), or increased by the absolute
value of such sum if such sum is a negative amount,

 

 

(C) if the Closing Working Capital is between the Minimum Working Capital
Amount and the Maximum Working Capital Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price
shall be increased by the amount of the Negative Initial Adjustment (if any)
or decreased by the amount of the Positive Adjustment (if any),

 

 

(D) if the Closing Net Cash Balance exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Cash
Balance, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by such excess,

 

 

(E) if the Estimated Closing Net Cash Balance exceeds the Closing Net Cash
Balance, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be decreased by such excess,
and

 

 

(F) the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by the FX Amount if a
net gain or decreased by the FX Amount if a net loss,

 

 

(the Preliminary Purchase Price as so adjusted shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Purchase Price"). If the Preliminary Purchase Price is less than
the Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Preliminary Purchase Price is
more than the Purchase Price, Parent shall, within 10 business days after the
Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, make payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds of the amount of such difference,
together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from
time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., as its prime rate,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365,
from (and including) the Closing Date through (but not including) the date of
payment. The difference between the Purchase Price and the Preliminary
Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Target Shares and the Acquired
Assets in accordance with the Allocation (set forth in Section 9(l) below) if
the Allocation is completed at the time such difference is paid. If the
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this Section 2(g) has to be paid by
Buyer and the Allocation is not completed at the time such purchase price
adjustment is paid, the difference between the Purchase Price and the
Preliminary Purchase Price shall be paid in such amounts and to such accounts
as Sellers shall direct.

 

 

 

(v) "Working Capital" means, as of any date, the sum of net accounts
receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts
payable and accrued expenses of the Business as adjusted in accordance with
Section 2(g)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule, in each case, as of the close of
business on such date; provided, that "Working Capital" shall not include any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20

item included in the Net Cash Balance, any gains or losses under an FX
Contract, any refund, credit, or other asset relating to any Income Tax or
any accrual with respect to Income Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
deferred tax assets or liabilities, accrued amounts for prepaid insurance,
any amount payable or receivable pursuant to Intercompany Receivables,
Intercompany Payables or Assumed Intercompany Receivables, or any liabilities
under the Retention Arrangements or in respect of Severance Obligations,
Bonus Obligations, Early Retirement Obligations or Pension Obligations. The
term "Net Cash Balance" means, as of any date, (i) all cash and cash
equivalents minus (ii) any outstanding short term debt and long term debt
(which shall not include trade payables or capital or finance lease
obligations related to the Business, or any amounts payable or receivable
pursuant to Intercompany Receivables, Intercompany Payables, Assumed
Intercompany Receivables or any Intercompany Assumed Agreement) minus (iii)
any accrued liabilities with respect to the Bonus Obligations to the extent
the Bonus Obligations are not paid prior to Closing minus (iv) liabilities in
respect of the Severance Obligations, the Pension Obligations and the Early
Retirement Obligations, in each case as of the close of business on such
date. Working Capital and Net Cash Balance shall be calculated in accordance
with GAAP but subject to the methods, procedures, adjustments and practices,
consistently applied, as the corresponding line items of the working capital
and net cash balance statement as of September 30, 2007 set forth in Section
2(g)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Working Capital Schedule"), which
shows the calculation of Working Capital and Net Cash Balance based on the
unaudited September 30, 2007 balance sheet included as part of the September
Financial Statements (except as otherwise provided in Section 2(g)(v) of the
Disclosure Schedule), whether or not such methods, procedures, adjustments
and practices are in accordance with GAAP (it being understood that, in the
event of any inconsistency between GAAP and the methods, procedures,
adjustments and practices pursuant to which the Working Capital Schedule is
prepared, the latter shall prevail). The foregoing principles are referred to
in this Agreement as the "Working Capital Principles". The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether
there were mathematical errors in the Statement or the FX Statement and
whether the calculation of the Closing Working Capital and Closing Net Cash
Balance was done in accordance with the Working Capital Principles and the FX
Amount was calculated in accordance with this Section 2(g), and the
Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether GAAP was followed in calculating the Maximum
Working Capital Amount, the Minimum Working Capital Amount, the FX Amount,
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Net Cash
Balance, the Working Capital Schedule, the Financial Statements or the FX
Statement or as to whether the Maximum Working Capital Amount or Minimum
Working Capital Amount was correctly determined, or conduct any review of or
make any adjustments to the methods or assumptions used to calculate
the Pension Obligations. Any item included in, or any omission from,
the line items of the Working Capital Schedule that is based upon errors of
fact or mathematical errors or that is not in accordance with GAAP

shall be retained for purposes of calculating the Closing Working Capital and
the Closing Net Cash Balance, except as provided in Section 2(g)(v) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

 

(vi) Following the Closing, Buyer shall not take any action with respect to
the accounting books and records of the Business on which the Statement and
the FX Statement is to be based that would obstruct, prevent or otherwise
affect the results of the procedures set forth in this Section 2(g)
(including the amount of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Net Cash
Balance, the FX Amount or any other amount included Statement or the FX
Statement or the preparation or review of the Statement or the FX Statement).
From and after the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to
the Preliminary Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2(g), Buyer shall
(i) assist, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies
and the Target Subsidiaries) to assist, Parent, its accountants, advisors and
other representatives in its review of the Statement and the FX Statement
and (ii) afford to Parent, its accountants, advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Business to the extent

2(g).

case such representation or warranty shall be deemed made as of that earlier
date) as follows:

thereby have been duly authorized by Parent and its Subsidiaries that are

the Asset Sellers and the Share Seller has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, prior to the Closing, each of Parent's Subsidiaries will have
duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, and, assuming their due execution and delivery by
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, this Agreement constitutes each of
the Asset Sellers' and the Share Seller's, and each Ancillary Agreement to
which any of them is, or is specified to be, a party will, after execution
and delivery by Parent and/or each such Subsidiary, constitute Parent's
and/or such Subsidiary's, legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

 

 

(iii) Brokers' Fees. Except for Banc of America Securities LLC, whose
fees and commissions will be paid by Parent, neither Parent nor any of
Parent's Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation to pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

(iv) Noncontravention. The Sellers are not required to give any notice to,

individually and in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, will (i) subject to the governmental filings or other matters

that would not have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Sellers to perform their obligations under
this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(v) Target Shares. Except for the Alpharma Credit Agreement Lien
(which shall be released as of the Closing Date), each of the Target Shares
is held of record and owned beneficially by the Share Seller (and any other
entity which Parent may designate as an additional Share Seller as a result
of the Pre-Closing Restructuring) free and clear of any Liens and all capital
stock of the Target Subsidiaries is held of record and owned beneficially by
the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens.

any Liens (other than those Liens created by Buyer). Except for the
Alpharma Credit Agreement Lien, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to any option, warrant, purchase right, or other contract or

its Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any capital stock
or equity interests (as the case may be) of the Target Companies or Target

adverse effect on the ability of the Sellers to perform their obligations
under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

such instances which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of

Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and compliance with and filings and approvals under
Foreign Merger Control Laws, (B) the filing of the relevant instruments in
the requisite jurisdictions in order to effect guarantees in respect of, or
to create or perfect Liens granted to secure, the Indebtedness and other
obligations incurred as a result of the consummation of the Debt Financing
and (C) those the failure of which to be obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have

the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing.

outstanding Judgments applicable to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (b)
suits, actions or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
threatened against Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (c) investigations by

in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing.

 

 

(v) Securities Act. The Target Shares are being acquired for investment
only and not with a view to any public distribution thereof, and Buyer shall
not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of the Target Shares so acquired by it

Commitments have been delivered to Parent on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Buyer has delivered to Parent all written agreements, arrangements
or understandings related to the Financing (a) in the case of any such
agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, on or prior to the date of this Agreement and (b) in
the case of any such agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into
after the date of this Agreement, within three business days after the entry

sources. There are no conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the
Financing (including in any oral agreements) other than those contained in
the Financing Commitments (or in replacement commitments obtained by Buyer in

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

commitments contained in replacement commitments obtained by Buyer in
compliance with Section 5(c)) have not been reduced, terminated, withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Financing Commitments (or replacement
commitments obtained by Buyer in compliance with Section 5(c)) are in full
force and effect and are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer
and, to Buyer's knowledge, the applicable counterparties thereto. No event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments (or the replacement commitments
obtained by Buyer in compliance with Section 5(c)) that would constitute the
failure of any of the conditions to the Financing Commitments or would
reasonably be expected to impair or delay the funding of the Financing
Commitments. Buyer has fully paid any commitment fees or other fees incurred
in connection with the Financing that have become due and payable as of the

Subsidiary has received any written communication alleging that the Business

enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt Financing

otherwise not reasonably likely to impair or delay the funding of the Debt
Financing or the Closing, (B) satisfy, and cause its Affiliates to satisfy,

agreement related to the Financing.

 

 

(ii) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other

otherwise modify the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacement commitments
obtained by Buyer in compliance with this paragraph (c)) if such amendment,
supplement or other modification (1) does not contain additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing that
are more favorable in any respect to the Debt Financing sources than those
contained in Debt Financing Commitments and (2) is otherwise not reasonably
likely to impair or delay the funding of the Debt Financing or the Closing
(it being understood that, subject to the requirements of this clause (ii),
such amendment, supplement or other modification of the Debt Financing
Commitments (or any replacement commitments obtained by Buyer in compliance
with this paragraph (c)) may provide for the assignment of a portion of the
Debt Financing Commitment (or replacement commitments obtained by Buyer in
compliance with this paragraph (c)) to additional agents or arrangers and
grant such Persons approval rights with respect to certain matters as are
customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not amend the Interim
Loan Agreement in the manner set forth in Section (A) of the side letter
relating thereto dated as of the date of this Agreement, unless Buyer

documents related to the additional conditions precedent in such amendment
are in agreed form.

replacement commitments obtained by Buyer in compliance with this paragraph
(c)), Buyer shall

promptly notify Parent, and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
replacement commitments on terms that will enable Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that are not less favorable
in the aggregate (as determined by Buyer in its reasonable judgment) to Buyer
and Parent than those contained in the Financing Commitments; provided
that such replacement commitments shall not (A) be subject to any additional
or modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing
that are more favorable in any respect to the Financing sources than those
contained in the Financing Commitments or (B) otherwise be reasonably likely
to impair or delay the funding of the Financing or the Closing. Buyer
shall deliver to Parent complete and correct copies of all amendments,
supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to which any amended,
supplemented, modified or replacement commitments shall provide Buyer with
any portion of the Financing; provided that Buyer may redact from any such
copies the fee amounts payable to their Financing sources.

 

 

(iv) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' accountants, legal

required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Debt Financing, (II) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (III) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
take any action that would be prohibited by applicable Law, including
financial assistance restrictions applicable to any Target Company or Target
Subsidiary. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Parent, reimburse Parent
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Affiliates from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with providing cooperation in respect of the Debt
Financing pursuant to this Section 5(c) and any information utilized in
connection therewith. Parent shall have the right to consent to the use of

Post-Closing Tax Period; or

 

 

(xix) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing;

 

 

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will prohibit or

(e) Full Access; Pre-Closing Confidentiality. The Asset Sellers will permit,
and the Share Seller (and any other entity which Parent may designate as an
additional Share Seller as a result of the Pre-Closing Restructuring) will
cause each of the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries to permit,
representatives of Buyer (including legal counsel, prospective financing
sources and accountants) to have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours, to all premises, properties, personnel, books,
records (including Tax records (other than any Income Tax records of
Parent)), contracts, work papers (subject to the receipt of consent from
Sellers' auditors) and documents of or pertaining to the Asset Sellers (to
the extent related to the Business) and each of the Target Companies and the
Target Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (i) such access shall not permit
any representatives of Buyer to conduct any environmental testing or
sampling, (ii) such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Sellers, the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries
and (iii) Parent shall not be obligated to afford to Buyer or any of its
representatives (including legal counsel, prospective financing sources and
accountants) any access to any Contract or information the disclosure of

including, without limitation, Laws relating to antitrust or (B) would
jeopardize the legal privilege accorded to such Contract or information,
provided that promptly after execution of this Agreement the Sellers shall
provide Buyer written notice of the nature and substance of any such
information or Contracts that are withheld (to the greatest extent possible
under such confidentiality obligations or applicable Law or as would not, in
the judgment of Parent, jeopardize any such legal privilege) and the basis
for such withholding. Buyer will, and will cause its representatives
(including legal counsel, prospective financing sources and accountants), to
treat and hold any information received from the Sellers or any of the Target
Companies or the Target Subsidiaries in the course of the
reviews contemplated by this Section 5(e) in accordance with the

(the "Confidentiality Agreement") which Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided, that
the obligations of Buyer with respect to confidential information relating
solely to the Business shall terminate on the Closing Date. For three (3)
years from the date of this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Asset Sellers to, retain all books and records that are related to the
Business in accordance with Parent's record retention policies as in effect
at such time. During the three-year period beginning on the date of

entered into after the date of this Agreement not in violation of Section
5(d), together with any ancillary obligations thereto, issued by Parent or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Target Companies or Target

Subsidiaries on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than
guarantees or sureties issued on behalf of another Target Company or Target
Subsidiary or in respect of the Business), without further recourse to the
applicable Target Company and Target Subsidiaries and (ii) the Target
Companies and Target Subsidiaries to be unconditionally released in full from

obligation of the Business), without further recourse to the applicable
Target Company or Target Subsidiary. Parent and its Affiliates shall, on a

interest accrued thereon and all fees or charges associated therewith) owed
by any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary to any Person (including
Parent and its Affiliates), other than Indebtedness owed to another Target
Company or Target Subsidiary, Indebtedness that is an Assumed Intercompany
Receivable, that is incurred pursuant to an Intercompany Assumed Agreement or
letters of credit issued for the account of the Business or in connection
with any liability or obligation of the Business and (ii) shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, repay in full all Indebtedness and ancillary
obligations thereto (including all interest accrued thereon and all fees or

portion of the Assumed Intercompany Receivables prior to Closing as a
contribution to the capital of Alpharma AS, with the amount of such assigned
and capitalized portion of the Assumed Intercompany Receivables (including
accrued interest) to be not less than an amount such that, after giving
effect to such capitalization, Alpharma AS shall have a positive enterprise
value net of debt, as determined in Parent's reasonable judgment; provided,
that Parent shall not be required to assign or capitalize any amount in
excess of the amount of the Assumed Intercompany Receivables held by Alpharma
Bermuda G.P. at the time of such assignment. The amount of such assigned and
capitalized portion of the Assumed Intercompany Receivables shall be

subject to and consistent with the foregoing sentence, after reasonable
consultation with Parent.

 

 

(j) Transition Services Agreement. From the date of this Agreement until

following input from the information technology representatives of both
Parties. Prior to Closing, Parent shall provide Buyer with an allocation of

SECTION 6. Post-Closing Covenants. Parent and Buyer agree as follows with
respect to the period following the Closing.

 

 

(a) General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
Parent and Buyer will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request (for no further consideration) to more effectively
consummate the purchase and sale of Target Shares and Acquired Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, including (i) transferring back to
Parent any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability and (ii) transferring to the
applicable Target Company or Target Subsidiary any Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability (or any asset or liability that would be an Acquired Asset or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

Acquired Liability if the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries were Asset
Sellers) contemplated hereby to be transferred at the Closing which was not
so transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, in the event
that Parent is unable to make such transfers or assignments contemplated by
Section 2(c) prior to Closing, after the Closing Date Buyer shall take all
actions (or shall cause its Affiliates to take all actions) reasonably
requested by Parent to give effect to Section 2(c).

 

 

(b) Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each Target Company
and each Target Subsidiary to conduct its business in the ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as currently conducted and on the Closing Date
shall not permit any Target Company or Target Subsidiary to effect any
extraordinary transactions (other than any such transactions
expressly required by applicable Law or by this Agreement) that could result
in Tax liability to any Target Company or Target Subsidiary in excess of Tax
liability associated with the conduct of its business in the ordinary course.

338(g) of the Code for any Target Company or Target Subsidiary.

other hand, shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause their Affiliates
and their officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to
cooperate with each other, after the Closing to facilitate the orderly
transition of the Business to Buyer after the Closing and to minimize any
disruption to the Business that might result from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, upon
reasonable written notice, Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other and the other's
Affiliates and their officers, employees, counsel, auditors and
representatives access, during normal business hours, to such information and
assistance relating to the Business (to the extent within the control of such
Party) as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting, accounting and Tax
matters.

 

 

(ii) Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall reimburse
the other for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section 6(d). Neither Party
shall be required by this Section 6(d) to take any action that would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably
disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Buyer, those of the
Business).

 

 

(e) Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. (i) For a period of three years from
and after the Closing Date (or, solely in the case of the active
pharmaceutical ingredients bacitracin and bacitracin zinc, five years),

as such) will, directly or indirectly, manufacture or sell the
active pharmaceutical ingredients set forth on Section 6(e)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule primarily for incorporation into finished dose human
pharmaceutical products (the "API Competitive Activities"); provided,
however, that it shall not be a violation of this Section 6(e)(i) for Parent
or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries to (A) own or acquire any equity
securities (or securities convertible into

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

equity securities) of any Person which invests in, manages or operates a
business that engages in API Competitive Activities, in each case, provided
that such equity securities (or securities convertible into equity
securities) represent less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of such
Person, (B) own or acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any
Person that derives 10% or less of its annual consolidated revenues from API
Competitive Activities, (C) develop, manufacture or sell active
pharmaceutical ingredients primarily intended for incorporation into finished
dose non-human pharmaceutical products, (D) operate Parent's animal health

Agreement. Subject to Section 11(d), nothing in this Section 6(e)(i) shall
prevent any sale of all or substantially all of the assets or the business of
Parent's animal health division by Parent and its Affiliates to any Person;
provided such purchaser shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 6(e)(i).

 

 

(ii) For a period of three years from and after the Closing Date (or, solely
in the case of the active pharmaceutical ingredients bacitracin and
bacitracin zinc, five years), neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (in their capacity as such) will, directly or indirectly,
manufacture or sell active pharmaceutical ingredients that are set forth on
Section 6(e)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule primarily intended for
incorporation into the finished dose animal pharmaceutical products (the "AH
Competitive Activities"); provided, however, that it shall not be a
violation of this Section 6(e)(ii) for Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (A)
own or acquire any equity securities (or securities convertible into equity
securities) of any Person which invests in, manages or operates a business
that engages in AH Competitive Activities, in each case, provided that such
equity securities (or securities convertible into equity

of the Disclosure Schedule in human grade (the "Exception
Products"); provided that none of Buyer nor its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
may knowingly manufacture the Exception Products for or sell the Exception
Products to customers who intend to incorporate the Exception Products into
finished dose non-human pharmaceutical products, except for annual sales of
the Exception Products in any fiscal year in an aggregate amount no greater
than an amount equal to 105% of the average of the aggregate yearly sales of
the Exception Products by the Business for the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years
(the "Exception Product Sales Cap"); provided however that for the fiscal
year commencing on January 1, 2009 the Exception Product Sales Cap
shall increase by 5%, and shall increase by an

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53

additional 5% for each fiscal year thereafter. Prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver to Buyer a list of the customers who incorporated the
Exception Products into finished dose non-human pharmaceutical products,
together with a statement setting out total sales by the Business in each of
2006 and 2007 of the Exception Products that were used in connection with
finished dose non-human pharmaceutical products. Subject to Section 11(d),
nothing in this Section 6(e)(ii) shall prevent any sale of all
or substantially all of the assets or the business of the Business by the
Buyer Entities to any Person; provided such purchaser shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section 6(e)(ii).

 

 

(iii) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, none of
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall induce, solicit or encourage any
Person who is at such time a Transferred Employee to leave or curtail his or
her employment with the Buyer Entities; provided, however, that it shall not
be a violation of this Section 6(e)(iii) for Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to engage in general advertising or employee search
activities targeted to a broad pool of potential applicants for a position
(and not specifically targeting employees of the Buyer Entities).

 

 

(iv) Except as otherwise specifically required by this Agreement, from the
date of this Agreement until twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
the Buyer Entities shall not induce, solicit or encourage any Person who is
an employee of Parent or its Affiliates, other than the Transferred
Employees, to leave or curtail his or her employment with Parent or its
Affiliates; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of this
Section 6(e)(iv) for any of the Buyer Entities to engage in general
advertising or employee search activities targeted to a broad pool of
potential applicants for a position (and not specifically targeting employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries).

 

 

(f) Use of Name and Trademarks. Buyer shall promptly, and in any event
within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, revise product literature
and labeling to (a) delete all references to the Seller Name and (b) delete
all references to Parent's or any of its Affiliates' customer service address
or phone number; provided, however, that (i) for a period no longer than
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
have the right to use, solely in connection with the operation of the
Business, printed purchase orders, sales invoices, marketing materials,
stationary, printed forms, other documents and office supplies, in each case,
on hand on the Closing Date, containing the Seller Name thereon, and (ii) for
the shorter of twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date or such time as
the use of packaging materials, stocks and shipping supplies is necessary to
comply with applicable marketing authorizations, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have the right to use, solely in connection with the operation of the
Business, packaging materials, stocks and shipping supplies (collectively,
together with the materials described in clause (i) above, the
"Marketing Material"), in each case, on hand on the Closing Date, containing
the Seller Name thereon. Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within one-
hundred-eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, amend the certificate
of incorporation, approval certificate, business license or other
relevant corporate documentation of the Target Companies and Target
Subsidiaries (as the case may be) to delete any references to the Seller Name
in the names of the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries. In no event
shall Buyer use the Seller Name (or any name confusingly similar thereto), or
any of Parent's or its Affiliates' addresses, phone

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

numbers or the Marketing Materials after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose different from the use of the Seller Name, addresses, phone numbers
or Marketing Materials by the Business during the 180-day period preceding
the Closing Date. With respect to the Inventory being transferred as part of
the Acquired Assets and any Inventories of the Target Companies and Target
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, Buyer may continue to sell such
Inventory, notwithstanding that it bears the Seller Name, for a reasonable
time after the Closing Date, not to exceed twenty-four (24) months. "Seller
Name" means "Alpharma", any variations and derivatives thereof and any other
logos or trademarks of Parent or its Affiliates not included in the
Intellectual Property that is owned by the Target Companies or Target
Subsidiaries and primarily used in or related to the Business. Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any marketing authorizations of the
Business to be revised to remove any references to the Seller Name as soon as
practicable but in no event less than twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date. After the Closing, none of Parent nor any of the Subsidiaries
shall, directly or indirectly, use or do business, or allow any of its
Affiliates to use or do business under the names and marks "A.L.
Laboratories" and Apothekernes Laboratorium" (or any other name confusingly
similar to such names and marks).

 

 

(g) Employee Benefits Matters.(i) From and after the date hereof until the
Closing, Buyer shall reasonably consult with Parent before distributing any
communications to any Employees of the Business relating to employee benefits
or post-Closing terms of employment. From after the date hereof, Sellers
shall reasonably consult with Buyer before distributing any communications to
any Employees of the Business regarding or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall incorporate Buyer's reasonable comments in
such communications. Parent shall reasonably consult with Buyer before
any negotiations or consultation process with works councils that are
required to accomplish the transfer of any Employees of the Business to the
Buyer Entities.

 

 

(ii) Prior to the Closing and effective on the Closing Date, Buyer or its
Affiliates will offer employment to each of the Employees set forth on
Section 6(g)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Assumed Employees") at the
same wage or salary levels, as applicable, and with employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits of
such Assumed Employees as of the date hereof. The Buyer Entities shall bear
100% of the costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Subsidiaries from and against, any claims made by any Assumed
Employee for any statutory or common law severance or other separation
benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any
other legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation
payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments
pursuant to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the Parties), in
each case, arising out of or in connection with the failure of the Buyer
Entities to make an offer of employment to or continue the employment of any
Assumed Employee in accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

(iii) For a period of two years immediately after the Closing Date, the Buyer
Entities shall provide to Transferred Employees the same base salary or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

wage rates, as applicable, and employee benefits under plans, programs and
arrangements (other than equity-based plans) which, in the aggregate, will
provide benefits to the Transferred Employees which are no less favorable in
the aggregate to the benefits provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any equity-
based compensation or benefits). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as requiring either
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries to
be obligated to continue the employment of any Transferred Employees for any
period after the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding Section 6(g)(iii) above, effective from and after the
Closing Date, (1) with respect to non-U.S. Transferred Employees, the Buyer
Entities shall provide to such Transferred Employees the same terms and
conditions of employment (including Employee Benefit Plans, programs, social
insurance contribution or arrangements) to the extent required by applicable
Law in any non-U.S. jurisdiction such that Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries
shall avoid any liability that would otherwise result from a failure to
maintain the same terms and conditions (including Employee Benefit Plans,
programs or arrangements), and (2) with respect to Transferred Employees
covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements, the Buyer Entities shall remain
bound by or, as applicable, assume such Collective Bargaining Agreements and
provide to such Transferred Employees the same terms and conditions of
employment (including Employee Benefit Plans, programs or arrangements) to
the extent required by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements or by
applicable Law.

 

 

(v) For the two-year period immediately following the Closing Date, the Buyer
Entities shall provide severance or similar termination benefits to each
Transferred Employee who is covered by the Retention Arrangements, Alpharma
Severance Plan included in Section 6(g)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule or any
severance plan maintained by any of the Target Companies (the "Target Company
Severance Plans") immediately prior to the Closing Date and whose employment
is terminated by the Buyer Entities within such two-year period for reasons
other than for "cause" (as defined in the Alpharma Severance Plan) at least
as favorable to the Transferred Employees as those contained in the
Retention Arrangements, the Alpharma Severance Plan or the Target Company
Severance Plans.

 

 

(vi) Effective from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer Entities shall (A)
recognize, for all purposes (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan other than any Target Company Benefit Plan) under all
Employee Benefit Plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained
by the Buyer Entities for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, service
with the Asset Sellers, the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was recognized under the
corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plan covering such Transferred
Employees including, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels
and accruals, and (B) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-
at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and other
welfare benefit plans established or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56

maintained by the Buyer Entities for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plan and (C) provide full credit for
any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to
the Closing Date for the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 

 

(vii) Effective from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer Entities shall
assume, honor, and perform all obligations and liabilities in respect of any
Transferred Employee for (A) all accrued but unused flex time, vacation days
and sick days to which any Transferred Employee is entitled as of the Closing
Date under the Seller Employee Benefit Plans and (B) claims for hospital,
medical, dental or other health benefits, expenses or other reimbursements
relating to any medical service, product or confinement provided to or in
respect of any Transferred Employee (or his or her eligible dependents)
incurred on or after the Closing Date or prior to the Closing Date to the
extent accrued on the Statement.

 

 

(viii) As a result of Buyer's acquisition of the outstanding stock or equity
interests (as the case may be) of the Target Companies and the Target
Subsidiaries, the Buyer Entities shall retain and be liable for all of the
Seller Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Target Companies and the
Target Subsidiaries, including the defined benefit pension plans and defined
contribution plans set forth on Section 6(g)(viii) of the Disclosure
Schedule. Buyer shall assume any liabilities with respect to (i) any early
retirement pension plans for the benefit of Employees of the Business and
former employees of the Business in Norway and Denmark and (ii) any severance
plans or arrangements for the benefit of any Employees of the Business or any
former employees of the Business in Norway and Denmark.

 

 

(ix) For the two-year period immediately following the Closing Date, the
Buyer Entities shall maintain the defined contribution plans sponsored by the
Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries, and shall provide to each of
the Transferred Employees who participates in any such plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date with a level of benefits pursuant to such plan that is no
less favorable than the level of benefits provided under such plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(x) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause all U.S. Transferred
Employees to be 100% vested in their benefits under the Alpharma Inc. Pension
Plan; the A.L. Pharma Supplemental Pension Plan; the Alpharma Inc. Savings
Plan and the Alpharma Inc. Prior Supplemental Savings Plan, the Alpharma Inc.
2005 Supplemental Savings Plan and the Alpharma Inc. 2007 Supplemental
Savings Plan and shall permit distributions in accordance with the terms of
such plans. No assets or liabilities from the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan or
the A.L. Pharma Supplemental Pension Plan shall be transferred to the
Buyer Entities or to any pension plan maintained by Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries, and Seller shall remain responsible for any and all liabilities
to Employees of the Business in

not already contributed prior thereto, an aggregate cash amount to the
Alpharma Inc. Savings Plan on behalf of the Transferred Employees equal to
the "employer matching contributions" payable for the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs under the Alpharma Inc. Savings Plan with respect to the
elective deferred contributions actually made by the Transferred Employees to
such plans prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(xi) Effective from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer Entities shall
assume, honor, and perform all obligations and liabilities under (A) the

any such Retention Arrangement, (B) the Bonus Obligations (to the extent such
obligations have not been paid as of the Closing Date), (C) the Pension

6(g)(xi)(D) of the Disclosure Schedule and (E) the Severance Obligations.

between the parties to this Agreement that may be waived or amended at any
time by the parties hereto without regard to the impact of such waiver or
amendment on any employee, former employee or other third party. The
provisions of this Section 6(g) are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no employee or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an

any purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein is or shall be deemed
a guarantee of continued employment with respect to any Employee of the

than $1,000,000,000 (or the equivalent if a non-U.S. insurer). Such insurance
policies will designate Parent as an additional insured. Furthermore, the
policies shall provide for a waiver of subrogation in favor of Parent.

financial size and a similar business purpose as that conducted by the
Business after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

additional insureds as their interests may appear or beneficiaries or in any
other capacity under the "claims made" or "occurrence reported" policies
within the Alpharma Global Insurance Program in respect of claims made or
occurrences reported during the period prior to the Closing Date. Any
Insurance proceeds received by Seller after the Closing under such policies
and programs in respect of the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries
with respect to liabilities that Parent has Knowledge of prior to the Closing
that would be Assumed Liabilities if the Target Companies and Target
Subsidiaries were Asset Sellers shall be for the benefit of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries; provided that liabilities or expenses resulting from
deductibles, self-insurance retentions, or other amounts, including allocated
and unallocated loss expenses, as defined in the policies governing such
benefits, shall be borne by Buyer and its Subsidiaries; provided further
that 50% of any liabilities resulting from product liability claims made
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date under Parent's U.S.
product liabilities policy that would be reimbursable under the terms of such
policy except for the deductible on such policy shall be borne by Parent,
provided however that the aggregate amount of such liabilities to be borne
by Parent for all claims under this proviso will be limited to $2,500,000
in aggregate.

 

 

(i) Confidentiality. Except to the extent disclosure is required by
applicable Law, Parent shall keep confidential, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to keep confidential, all information relating to the Business
("Confidential Business Information"), except with respect to Confidential
Business Information (A) that is available to the public prior to the Closing
Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of this Section 6(i) or (B) that becomes available to Parent or
its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than Buyer or its Subsidiaries; provided that such source was
not known by the recipient to be bound by a confidentiality obligation to
Buyer with respect to such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, Parent shall be permitted disclose Confidential
Business Information to the extent such information is related to a business
other than the Business. The covenant set forth in this Section 6(i)
shall terminate on the first anniversary after the Closing Date.

enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement.

 

 

(k) Closure of Beijing Representative Office. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer and Parent and each of their Affiliates shall cooperate in

agent to be the representative officer of the BRO for the sole purpose of
winding down the office, in which event Buyer shall incur no employment
related liability for such designated employee or agent, who shall remain at
all times the employee or agent of Parent or its Subsidiary.

(c) Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor

Party's failure to act in good faith or to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur and to arrange the Financing as required by Section 5(c).

 

 

SECTION 8. Remedies for Breaches of This Agreement.

 

 

(a) Survival. All of the representations and warranties in Sections 3 and 4
of this Agreement (other than Section 4(i)) and the covenants contained in
Section 5 shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for
a period of 18 months thereafter; provided, that all of the representations
and warranties of Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, contained in Sections

survive the Closing. The covenants contained herein (other than those
contained in Section 5) shall survive indefinitely except as otherwise
specified herein.

 

 

(b) Indemnification by Parent. Subject to Section 8(e) below, in the
event of any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations, warranties
or covenants made by Parent or any Seller (other than a breach or inaccuracy
of a representation, warranty or covenant in respect of Taxes, which shall be
subject exclusively to Section 9(b) below) contained herein, provided that
Buyer makes a written claim for indemnification against Parent pursuant
to Section 8(d) below within the applicable survival period, Parent
shall indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries) and each of their stockholders,
members, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against any Losses any of them has
suffered through and after the date of the claim for indemnification by Buyer
caused by or arising from Parent's or such Seller's breach or inaccuracy. In
addition, Parent agrees to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against
any Losses any of them shall suffer caused by or arising from any liability
that is an Excluded Liability.

 

 

(c) Indemnification by Buyer. In the event of any breach of inaccuracy of
any of the representations, warranties and covenants made by Buyer contained
herein, provided that Parent makes a written claim for indemnification
against Buyer pursuant to Section 8(d) below, Buyer shall indemnify Parent,
its Affiliates and each of their stockholders, members, partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against any Losses any of them has suffered through
and after the date of the claim for indemnification by Parent caused by or
arising from Buyer's breach or inaccuracy. Buyer agrees to indemnify the
Seller Indemnitees from and against any Losses any of them shall suffer
caused by or arising

from any liability that is an Assumed Liability or any liability that would
be an Assumed Liability if the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries were
Asset Sellers.

 

 

(d) Procedures. (i) Third Party Claims. (A) In order for a Person (the
"Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
Section 8(b) or (c) in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made
by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party must notify the Person from whom it is
requesting indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing (and in
reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by
such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however,
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice).
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
material notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

 

(B) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party; provided that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees, costs and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any
period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the
Third Party Claim as provided above). If both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are parties to or subjects of a Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or
more legal or equitable defenses available to it that are different from or
in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, counsel for the
Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnified Party because such interests could be in conflict with those of
the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain its own counsel, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided
that in any case the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the
expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties,
taken together. Each Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
of any Third Party Claim and the Party controlling the defense thereof shall
keep the other party reasonably advised of the status of such defense. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's
request) the provision to the Indemnifying

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim and which unconditionally and irrevocably releases the
Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim. All
claims under Section 8(b) and (c) other than Third Party Claims shall be
governed by Section 8(d)(ii).

 

 

(ii) Other Claims. If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under Section 8(b) and (c) that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from
such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver notice
of such claim to the Indemnifying Party after obtaining knowledge of
such claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 8(b) and
(c), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 60 calendar days following its receipt of
such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under Section 8(b) and (c), such claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party under Section 8(b) and (c) and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on
demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any
portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such
claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

 

 

(e) Limitations on Indemnification. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee for any Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of
any representations or warranties contained in Sections 3(a) and 4 unless
and until the aggregate amount of all such claims is at least equal to
$4,100,000 (and Parent shall only be required to indemnify Buyer for such
claims in excess of such amount). Parent's aggregate amount of liability
under Section 8(b) for breaches and inaccuracies of any representations
or warranties contained in Sections 3(a) and 4 is limited to an amount
equal to $60,000,000. Parent shall not have any liability under Section 8(b)
for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $75,000.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall not be
obligated to indemnify Buyer against any Losses arising from or relating to
any claim or liability to the extent such claim or liability or the Losses
therefrom as and to the extent such liabilities are reflected in the
Statement or the FX Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Calculation of Losses. (i) The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Section 8 and under Section
9 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under insurance policies with respect to such Loss less the aggregate cost
and expense of pursuing any such insurance claims.

 

 

(ii) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Section 8 and under Section 9 shall be reduced to take account of any
net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence
or payment of any such Loss and shall be increased by the amount of the
Income Tax, if any, attributable to the receipt of such indemnity
payment subject to the Parties' compliance with Section 8(h). Tax
benefits are to be determined using the assumptions that each Party pays
federal, state, local and foreign Tax at the highest applicable corporate Tax
rate and can fully utilize any available Tax benefits.

 

 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8(f), in any case where
the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from third parties any amount in
respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has
indemnified it pursuant to Section 8 or Section 9, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered
(after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid
by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect
of such matter.

 

 

(g) Exclusive Remedy; No Consequential Damages; Mitigation. (i) Subject to
Section 11(k), the Parties acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, the
foregoing indemnification provisions in this Section 8 and, with respect to
Taxes, the provisions of Section 9, shall be the exclusive remedy of the
Parties with respect to claims relating to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, and the Business and its assets
and liabilities (other than for fraud). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have
any remedy after the Closing for any breach of the representations and
warranties in Sections 3(a) and 4 above, with respect to which Buyer fails to
make a written claim for indemnification within the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 8(a) above (other than for fraud).
In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Parent, for itself and
its Affiliates (including the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries),
waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for damages it may have
against the other or its Affiliates arising under this Agreement, any
document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law
(including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act and any other Environmental Law), common law
or otherwise, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Section 8.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) None of Buyer, any Target Company, any Target Subsidiary, any Asset
Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be liable or otherwise
responsible to any other Person for consequential, incidental, special or
punitive damages arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the performance or breach of
this Agreement or any liability or obligation retained or assumed under this
Agreement, other than any such consequential, incidental, special or punitive
damages that are the subject of a Third Party Claim for which indemnification
is available hereunder.

 

 

(iii) Buyer and Parent shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated
to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by using its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the event
that Buyer or Parent shall fail to use such reasonable best efforts to
mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary contained herein, the other Party shall not be required
to indemnify any Person for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense
that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Buyer or Parent, as
the case may be, had made such efforts.

 

 

(iv) The rights to indemnification under this Section 8 shall not be
adversely affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that Buyer, its
employees, agents or representatives became aware after the date of this
Agreement that any representation or warranty is or might be breached or
inaccurate; provided that the forgoing limitation on indemnification shall
not apply to the knowledge of Buyer, its employees, agents and
representatives of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
as of the date of this Agreement.

 

 

(h) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any indemnity payment under this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law.

 

 

(i) No Duplicative Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, it is intended that the provisions of this Agreement will not
result in a duplicative payment of any amount required to be paid under this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.

 

 

SECTION 9. Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreement between Sellers
and their Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies and the Target
Subsidiaries) on the one hand and any of the Target Companies or the Target
Subsidiaries on the other hand shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Tax Indemnification by Parent. (i) From and after the Closing,
Parent shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against and hold them harmless
from any Losses to the extent attributable to:

(B) except as provided in Section 9(c), any Non-Income Taxes imposed on the
Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries or imposed with respect to the
Acquired Assets, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to the extent the
aggregate amount of such Non-Income Taxes is in excess of the aggregate
reserves for Non-Income Tax liabilities included in the Statement,

 

 

(C) any Taxes that may be imposed on any Target Company or any Target
Subsidiary as a result of being a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary
or similar group of corporations or other taxpayers at any time on or prior
to the Closing Date other than a group consisting solely of Target Companies
and/or Target Subsidiaries,

 

 

(D) any Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Person (other than any
Target Company or Target Subsidiary) imposed on any Target Company or Target
Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law,

 

 

(E) all liability from any breach of Sellers' covenants in this Section 9
relating to Taxes,

Target Company or Target Subsidiary arising solely on the Closing Date solely
by reason of the transfers of the Target Shares and the Acquired Assets
contemplated by this Agreement,

 

 

(H) any reasonable legal and accounting expenses related thereto, and

 

 

(I) any liability resulting from any obligation of a Target Company or Target
Subsidiary under any stock purchase, asset purchase, merger or other
similar agreement entered into before the date hereof to indemnify any other
Person (other than a Target Company or Target Subsidiary) for any Taxes
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided that after the Closing
Date such Target Company or such Target Subsidiary has not waived any defense
it may have against any such obligation without the prior consent of Parent.

 

 

(ii) Any amount payable under subparagraphs 9(b)(i)(A) and 9(b)(i)(C) above
shall be reduced by any Tax benefit attributable to any net operating losses
(or similar Tax attributes) or any Tax credit of any Target Company or any
Target

Subsidiary to which Buyer succeeded. Such Tax benefit is to be determined
using the assumptions that each Party pays federal, state, local or foreign
Tax at the highest applicable corporate Tax rate and can fully utilize any
available Tax benefits.

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee for any Tax in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is (A)
an Assumed Liability or (B) recoverable by any Buyer Indemnitee in a Post-
Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes attributable
to timing differences).

 

 

(c) Tax Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing, Buyer, the
Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and hold them harmless from (i) any Taxes
imposed on any Seller Indemnitee (as they relate to the Business), the Target
Companies, or the Target Subsidiaries, or imposed with respect to the
Acquired Assets, for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any Transfer Taxes for
which Buyer is liable under Section 9(k), (iii) any breach by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates of any covenant contained in Section 6(b) or 6(c), (iv) all
liability from any breach of Buyer's covenants in this Section 9 relating to
Taxes, and (v) any reasonable legal and accounting expenses related thereto.

 

 

(d) Straddle Periods. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"):

 

 

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") of the
Target Companies, or the Target Subsidiaries, or imposed with respect to
the Acquired Assets, for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period on a pro rata basis (based on the number of days
during such taxable period elapsed prior to the Closing Date). If at the time
of Closing, the tax rate or the assessed valuation for the year in which the
Closing occurs has not yet been fixed, Property Taxes shall be prorated based
upon the tax rate and the assessed valuation established for the previous tax
year; and

 

 

(ii) the Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Target Companies, or the
Target Subsidiaries, or imposed with respect to the Acquired Assets, for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

 

 

(e) Tax Returns; Tax Payments. (i) Parent shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing (taking into account any extensions received from
the relevant Taxing Authorities) of all Tax Returns required by Law to (A)
be filed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) be filed by any of
the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

 

(ii) Buyer, the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing (or causing to be filed) of all
other Tax Returns related to Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries.
Buyer, the

Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior
consent of Parent, engage any outside service provider in connection with any
Tax Return of any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary for any tax year
that ends before the Closing Date to be filed after the Closing Date, and
Buyer, the Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries shall not, without
the prior consent of Parent, engage Ernst and Young for purposes of preparing
any Tax Return of any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary that relates to
a Straddle Period. In the case of a Tax Return (A) for a Straddle Period or
(B) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period filed after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare such Tax Return on a basis consistent with past practice and submit
such Tax Return to Parent at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Return (it being understood that (A) this clause
shall not limit Buyer's right to reorganize the business arrangements of the
Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries with effect after the Closing
Date, including the implementation of (or amendments to) any transfer
pricing arrangements involving the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries,
and (B) Buyer shall, for purposes of preparing and filing the 2007 Norwegian
Income Tax Return of Alpharma AS, cause Alpharma AS to opt out of
"installment sale" treatment in respect of any transaction that occurred in
2007 and that would otherwise qualify for such treatment and shall cause
Alpharma AS to apply any of its net operating losses against any gain
realized from such transaction). If Parent objects to any item on such Tax
Return, it shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify Buyer in writing that it so objects. If a notice of objection is duly
delivered, Buyer and Parent shall negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items and, if they are unable to do
so within ten (10) calendar days, the disputed items shall be resolved
(within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such
Tax Return) by an accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and Parent the
cost of which shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by Buyer. Upon resolution
of all disputed items, the relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect
such resolution and shall be binding upon the Parties without
further adjustment.

 

 

(iii) All Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns will be paid
by filer, subject to reimbursement by the other Party pursuant to Sections
9(b), 9(c) and 9(d).

 

 

(iv) Buyer and Parent further agree, upon reasonable request, to use
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

 

(f) Tax Proceedings. (i) If any Taxing Authority shall notify any Person
entitled to indemnification under this Section 9 (the "Tax
Indemnified Party") of any Tax audit or proceeding, proposed Tax assessment
or other Tax matter (a "Tax Proceeding") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any other Party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") under
this Section 9, then the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(and in any event within 10 business days after receiving notice of the Tax
Proceeding, with an expedited time frame where necessary to comply with
governmental deadlines in connection with such Tax Proceeding) notify the Tax
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however, that failure to
timely give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has
been prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in
which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Any such notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the type of Tax involved in the Tax
Proceeding, the tax year(s) at issue and the basis for the Tax claim against
the Tax Indemnifying Party, and shall include a copy of any materials
received from the applicable Taxing Authority in connection therewith.

 

 

(ii) In the case of any Tax Proceeding:

 

 

(A) the Controlling Party shall be entitled to appoint as lead counsel any
legal counsel of its choice and shall control the conduct of the Tax
Proceeding;

 

 

(B) the Controlling Party shall provide the Noncontrolling Party with a
timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of the Tax Proceeding
and a copy of the portions of all documents relating to the Tax Proceeding
that are relevant to any Tax for which the Noncontrolling Party may be
required to indemnify or may otherwise be liable;

 

 

(C) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Noncontrolling Party before
taking any significant action in connection with the Tax Proceeding that
might adversely affect the Noncontrolling Party;

 

 

(D) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Noncontrolling Party and
offer the Noncontrolling Party a reasonable opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with the
Tax Proceeding (including, to the extent practicable, any documents furnished
to the applicable Taxing Authority in connection with any discovery request)
to the extent such materials concern matters in the Tax Proceeding that could
adversely affect the Noncontrolling Party;

 

 

(E) the Controlling Party shall defend the Tax Proceeding diligently and in
good faith;

 

 

(F) the Noncontrolling Party shall reasonably facilitate to the extent
requested by the Controlling Party, and shall not impede, the Tax Proceeding;

 

 

(G) the Controlling Party and the Noncontrolling Party shall cooperate
reasonably and in good faith in connection with any Tax Proceeding; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(H) the Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, of the
Noncontrolling Party if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would have
an unindemnified adverse impact on the Noncontrolling Party. If the
Noncontrolling Party reasonably withholds such consent pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
their differences and, failing that, shall submit the matter to binding
arbitration with a mutually acceptable arbitrator (with expedited time frames
where necessary to comply with governmental deadlines in connection with such
Tax Proceeding) to resolve the Parties' dispute in connection with the Tax
Proceeding.

 

 

(iii) For purposes of this Section 9(f) and subject to subparagraph (v)
below, "Controlling Party" means:

 

 

(A) Parent for any Tax Proceeding relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
other than a Straddle Period;

 

 

(B) Parent for any Tax Proceeding concerning any consolidated, combined,
unitary or group Tax Return that includes solely Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (except for a consolidated, combined, unitary or group Tax
Return that includes Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries); and

 

 

(C) Buyer for any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period with respect
to Buyer or the applicable Subsidiary (including any Target Company or Target
Subsidiary), or any Post-Closing Tax Period with respect to Buyer or the
applicable Subsidiary (including any Target Company or Target Subsidiary)
(other than a Tax Proceeding of which Parent is the Controlling Party
pursuant to the preceding clause (B)).

 

 

(iv) For purposes of this Section 9(f), "Noncontrolling Party" means:

 

 

(A) Parent in the case of a Tax Proceeding with respect to which Buyer is the
Controlling Party; and

 

 

(B) Buyer in the case of a Tax Proceeding with respect to which Parent is the
Controlling Party.

 

 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Indemnifying Party may elect to
control any Tax Proceeding which might result in a claim for indemnification
being sought from it and may participate in the Tax Proceeding regardless of
whether it chooses to control such Tax Proceeding.

 

 

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, nor any other Person shall have any
right to receive or obtain any information relating to, or have any rights
with respect to, any consolidated, combined, unitary or group Taxes or Tax
Returns of Parent or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

any of its Subsidiaries (other than information and rights relating solely to
items of the Target Companies, the Target Subsidiaries and the Acquired
Assets). Furthermore, any rights of Buyer with respect to any consolidated,
combined, unitary or group Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall apply only to the extent that Buyer might be adversely
affected, it being understood that any claim or issue that would increase Tax
for which Parent is responsible and liable hereunder and decrease Tax for
which Buyer is responsible and liable hereunder would not adversely affect
Buyer.

 

 

(g) Tax Refunds and Credits. (i) Any Income Tax refunds that are received by
Buyer or any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary or any other Affiliate,
and any amounts credited against Income Tax to which Buyer or any Target
Company or any Target Subsidiary or any other Affiliate becomes entitled,
that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Target Company or any Target
Subsidiary shall be for the account of Parent, and Buyer shall pay over to
Parent any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 

 

(ii) Any Non-Income Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or any Target
Company or any Target Subsidiary or any other Affiliate, and any amounts
credited against Non-Income Tax to which Buyer or any Target Company or any
Target Subsidiary or any other Affiliate becomes entitled, that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary shall
be for the account of Parent, and Buyer shall pay over to Parent any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after
receipt or entitlement thereto, to the extent such refund or credit is
attributable to Non-Income Taxes paid by Parent or any of its Affiliates or
for which Buyer was indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b)(i)(B) above.

 

 

(iii) To the extent requested by Parent, and at Parent's expense, Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in applying for and obtaining any available
Tax refunds with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, provided however, none
of Buyer, any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary shall be required to
take any action or position, that would materially adversely affect any of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Target Company or any Target
Subsidiary.

 

 

(h) Cooperation. Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent (on behalf of its
Affiliates), on the other hand, agree, in each case to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party and at no cost to the other Party, to

 

 

(i) furnish to the other Party in a timely manner information and documents
for purposes of preparing any original or amended Tax Returns to which
Section 9(d)(ii) applies and contesting or defending any Tax Proceeding;

 

 

(ii) cooperate in good faith in any Tax Proceeding;

 

 

(iii) retain and provide on demand books, records, documentation or other
information relating to any Tax Return until the later of (A) the expiration
of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any extension, waiver, or
mitigation thereof) and (B) in the event any claim is made under this
Agreement for which such information is relevant, until a final
determination, as defined under Section 1313(a) of the Code or similar
provision of non-U.S. law, with respect to such claim; and

 

 

(iv) take such action as such other Party may deem appropriate in connection
therewith, including cooperation with respect to the preparation of financial
statements as they relate to Taxes and related matters.

 

 

(i) VAT. (i) Subject to Section 9(i)(ii), the consideration specified for all
supplies made or deemed to be made under or in connection with this Agreement
shall be exclusive of VAT. Parent and Buyer shall procure that any of their
respective Affiliates receiving the supply in question shall pay to the
Person making that supply (in addition to the specified consideration) all
VAT for which the Person making the supply is required by any Taxing
Authority to charge in relation to that supply. All VAT payable under this
Agreement shall be paid two business days before that Person has to account
for the same and the supplier shall provide a VAT invoice.

 

 

(ii) The Parties intend that any sale of the Acquired Assets within the
European Union will be treated by the relevant Taxing Authority as a TOGC and
the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to procure that any such sale
is so treated. This obligation shall not require Parent to make any
appeal to any tribunal or court of law against any determination of any
Taxing Authority that the sale does not amount to a TOGC, unless Buyer shall
by such date as shall reasonably allow Parent to make such appeal or
challenge within any applicable time limit give written notice to Parent that
it requires such appeal or challenge to be made and shall first agree to
indemnify Parent against all irrecoverable costs and expenses that Parent may
incur by taking any such action.

 

 

(iii) Parent and Buyer shall procure that the Person retaining at the Closing
the VAT records relating to a Business that is sold shall preserve such
records for such periods as may be required by the relevant Law and during
such periods shall permit the other Party or its agents at all reasonable
times and subject to reasonable written notice to inspect and take copies of
such records at the cost of the Person requesting such inspection and/or
copies.

 

 

(iv) If it is finally determined by the relevant Taxing Authority that any
sale of the Acquired Assets under this Agreement does not constitute a TOGC,
then Buyer shall procure that VAT chargeable shall be paid by the relevant
Affiliate to Parent two business days before Parent has to account for the
same and against production of a valid VAT invoice and any VAT records
provided by Parent to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate shall be returned to Parent.
Buyer shall indemnify or procure that such Affiliate shall indemnify Parent
on an after Tax basis against any penalty and interest charges incurred by
Parent to any Taxing Authority in relation to such VAT.

Parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be
governed solely by the provisions of this Section 9.

 

 

(k) Transfer Taxes. (i) All recoverable and non-recoverable transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and other such Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) (such Taxes, fees and charges, together with
any penalties or interest, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
transfer of the Target Shares and the Acquired Assets contemplated by this
Agreement, as well as the cost of the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, shall
be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Parent, and Parent and Buyer shall each file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation required to be filed by it
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by
applicable Law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

 

(ii) If there is any available sales Tax exemption in relation to any
Acquired Assets, Buyer shall timely deliver to the relevant Asset Seller the
relevant sales Tax exemption certificate.

 

 

(l) Allocation of Purchase Price. (i) Buyer and Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price
(the "Allocation") prior to the Closing Date. The Allocation shall allocate
for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) the
Purchase Price (including liabilities and other capitalized costs) among the
Acquired Assets and the Target Shares.

 

 

(ii) At least 30 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
deliver a draft of the Allocation (the "Proposed Allocation") to Buyer for
its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Except as provided in subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of this
Section 9(l), at the close of business on the 30th day after delivery of the
Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon Buyer
and Sellers, shall be set forth in an allocation schedule which shall be
deemed to be part of this Agreement (the "Allocation Schedule"), and shall be
the Allocation.

 

 

(iii) Buyer shall raise any objection to the Proposed Allocation in writing
within 30 calendar days of the delivery of the Proposed Allocation. Buyer
and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences until
the Closing Date. If Buyer and Sellers reach written agreement amending the
Proposed Allocation prior to the Closing Date, the Proposed Allocation, as so
amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and Sellers, shall be set forth
in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be the Allocation.

 

 

(iv) If Buyer and Sellers cannot agree on the Allocation before the Closing
Date, they shall continue to negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences until the date on which the purchase price adjustment
contemplated by Section 2(g) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

above is payable. If Buyer and Sellers reach written agreement amending the
Proposed Allocation prior to that date, the Proposed Allocation, as so
amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and Sellers, shall be set forth in
the Allocation Schedule, and shall be the Allocation.

 

 

(v) If Buyer and Sellers cannot agree on the Allocation before the date on
which the purchase price adjustment contemplated by Section 2(g) above is
payable, then each Party shall use its own allocation, as each such Party
shall deem appropriate.

 

 

(vi) The Allocation shall be amended (in a manner agreed by Buyer and Sellers
consistent with the methodology previously used) to reflect any adjustments
to the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Purchase Price under
this Agreement.

 

 

(vii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v) above, each of Sellers, Buyer
and their respective Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns
(including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Allocation.

 

 

(m) Certain Danish Income Tax Matters. Parent and Buyer acknowledge that, on
March 20, 2008, Alpharma ApS will be required to make an advance payment in
respect of its 2008 Danish Income Taxes. In the event that the Closing will
occur after the date such advance will be due, Parent shall pay the full
amount of such advance to the Danish Taxing Authorities, and Buyer and Parent
agree that the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount
equal to Buyer's share of such advance (which share shall be determined on a
per diem basis with respect to the period starting January 1, 2008 and ending
on June 30, 2008). In the event that the Closing will occur prior to the
date such advance will be due, Buyer shall pay the full amount of such
advance to the Danish Taxing Authorities, and Parent shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to Parent's share of such advance (which share shall be
determined on a per diem basis with respect to the period starting January 1,
2008 and ending on June 30, 2008) within (10) days after Buyer's payment of
such advance.

 

 

SECTION 10. Termination.

 

 

(a) Termination of Agreement. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(A) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Parent;

 

 

(B) by Parent if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7(b) shall have
become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by Parent;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(C) by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7(a) shall have
become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by Buyer;

 

 

(D) by Buyer or Parent, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to April
21, 2008 (the "Initial Outside Date"); provided, that if the Closing does
not occur by such date, solely due to the failure to have obtained any
approvals of any Governmental Entities that are required to complete the Pre-
Closing Restructuring, but all other conditions to Closing shall have
been fulfilled or shall be capable of being fulfilled as of such date, then
such date shall be extended for an additional 90-day period (the "Extended
Outside Date"); or

 

 

(E) by Buyer or Parent, if a final, nonappealable Judgment shall have been
entered by any Governmental Entity preventing the consummation of the Pre-
Closing Restructuring;

 

 

provided, however, that the Party seeking termination pursuant to clause (B),
(C) or (D) is not then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Parent pursuant to
this Section 10(a), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other Party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
terminated, without further action by any Party. If the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

 

 

(A) Buyer shall return all documents and other material received from Parent,
its Affiliates or their advisors or representatives relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether so obtained before or
after the execution of this Agreement, to Parent; provided that Buyer or its
representatives may retain documents and other material as a result
of customary electronic back-up procedures or as required by Law, subject to
clause (B) below; and

 

 

(B) all confidential information received by Buyer with respect to the
Business shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination
of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Effect of Termination; Termination Fee. (i) If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 10(a), this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of
(A) Sections 3(a)(iii) and 3(b)(x) relating to brokers and finders, (B)
Section 5(e) relating to the obligation of Buyer to keep confidential certain
information and data obtained by it, (C) Section 10(a) and this Section 10(b)
and (D) Section 11. Nothing in this Section 10(b) shall be deemed to release
any Party from any liability for any breach by such Party of the terms and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel
specific performance by any other Party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Parent pursuant
to Section 10(a)(i)(D) solely as a result of the failure to have obtained
any approvals of any Governmental Entities that are required to complete
the Pre-Closing Restructuring prior to the Extended Outside Date; (B) Buyer
has not entered into the Quotaholders Agreement prior to the Extended Outside
Date; and (C) there has not been a Pre-Closing Restructuring Denial, then
Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Termination Fee to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within five business days) following such termination.

 

 

(iii) Buyer and Parent acknowledge and agree that (A) the agreements
contained in this Section 10(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) without these agreements, neither Buyer
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement and (C) the damages
resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and the amounts payable pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this
Section 10(b) are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be
incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.

 

 

(iv) If Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to paragraph (ii)
of this Section 10(b) when due, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a
Judgment against Buyer for the Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest on the
Termination Fee from (and including) the date such payment was required to be
made through (but not including) the date of payment at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

 

SECTION 11. Miscellaneous.

 

 

(a) Press Releases and Public Announcements. Parent and Buyer shall not issue
any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other
Party; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any listing or
trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case
the disclosing Party will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other
Parties prior to making the disclosure) and any Party may issue a press
release upon entering into this Agreement after reasonable consultation with
the other Parties.

 

 

(b) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than as explicitly set forth
herein, including in Sections 8(b) and 8(c), this Agreement shall not confer
any rights or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

(c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the Equity
Financing Commitments and exhibits hereto and thereto constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.

 

 

(d) Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement
or any of his, her, or its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of Buyer and Parent; provided, however,
that Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to any lender providing
the Debt Financing to Buyer and any individual Buyer may assign its rights to
another individual Buyer, but no assignment pursuant to this proviso shall
relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, no lender shall be entitled to make a claim under this Agreement or
enforce any provision of this Agreement as a result of an assignment pursuant
to the foregoing sentence other than in connection with the exercise of
lender subrogation or other enforcement rights following an event of default
under the definitive Debt Financing agreements. The Buyer Entities shall
be entitled to assign their rights under Section 6(e)(i) to any purchaser
which acquires all or substantially all the assets or business of the
Business and Sellers and their Affiliates shall be entitled to enforce
Section 6(e)(ii) against any such purchaser. The Sellers and their Affiliates
shall be entitled to assign their rights under Section 6(e)(ii) to any
purchaser which acquires all or substantially all the assets or business of
the animal health business of Parent and its Affiliates and the Buyer
Entities shall be entitled to enforce Section 6(e)(i) against any such
purchaser.

 

 

(e) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by means of facsimile, PDF or other electronic transmission), each
of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument.

 

 

(f) Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement in any
Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to this Agreement and in the table of contents
hereto are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(h) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

 

(i) Consent to Jurisdiction. (i) Each Party irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting
in New York County and of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any suit,
action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition
or enforcement of any Judgment, and each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such suit, action or
other proceeding may be heard and determined in such court. The Parties agree
that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the Judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

 

(ii) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any court referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (i) of
this Section 11(i). Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement in any court referred to in the first sentence
of paragraph (i) of this Section 11(i).

 

 

(iii) Each Party consents, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
to service of any process, summons, notice or document in the manner provided
for notices in Section 11(g). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

 

 

(iv) This Section 11(i) shall not apply to any dispute under Section 2(g)
that is required to be decided by the Accounting Firm.

 

 

(j) Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect to any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Each Party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications in this Section 11(j).

(k) Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any Party
is entitled at Law or in equity.

 

 

(l) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or modification of any provision
of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by Buyer and Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any provision of
this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor
shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in
any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

 

 

(m) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudged to be excessively broad as to duration,
geographical scope, activity or subject, the Parties intend that such
provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum degree necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable under applicable Law and that such
modified provision shall thereafter be enforced to the further extent
possible.

 

 

(n) Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Buyer and
Sellers each will bear their own costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

(o) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to any
federal, state, local, or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a party
or to an Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall
be to a party to, an Article or Section of, or an Annex, Exhibit or Schedule
to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have their defined meanings when used in any Annex,
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement or any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein.
Whenever the words "include", "includes", "including" or "such as" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The word "will" shall be construed to have the
same meaning and effect as the word "shall." The words "hereof",

"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in this Agreement is
not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply "if". Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun
or pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and
to cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined
or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from
time to time amended, supplemented or modified, including (x) (in the case
of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and (y) all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset"
and "property" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect and to
refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets and properties, including
cash, securities, accounts and contract rights. References to "Buyer"
in this Agreement shall refer to each of the Persons included in the
definition of "Buyer" in the preface of this Agreement and all obligations
of Buyer in this Agreement shall be the joint and several obligation of each
such Person. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns. When a reference is made in this Agreement to the
Business, such reference shall also be a reference to the Target Companies
and Target Subsidiaries if the context so requires. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, all references to "dollars" or "$" will
be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America.

 

 

(p) Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules. The Exhibits, Annexes,
and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.
