AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of December 1, 2000, by and between
Cargill, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Abacus Acquisition
Corp., a Missouri corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub") and Agribrands International, Inc., a Missouri corporation
(the "Company").   Recitals   A. The Special Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company has recommended and the Board of Directors of the
Company has approved and deems it advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders to consummate the merger provided for herein
(the "Merger"), pursuant to which Parent will acquire all of the common stock
of the Company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. The Boards of
Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved and deem it advisable and in
the best interests of their respective companies and their respective
shareholders to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.   B. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire
to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER; CLOSING   1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement:   (a) At the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri
(the "Missouri Code"). The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Missouri. As a result of the Merger,
the Company shall become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. After
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease. The Merger shall have the effects as set forth in Section 351.450 of
the Missouri Code.   (b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place (a) at the offices of Bryan Cave LLP, One Metropolitan Square,
Suite 3600,    1   St. Louis, Missouri, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on the
fifth business day following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article IX (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in
accordance herewith, or (b) at such other time, date or place as Parent and
the Company may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."   (c) As soon as practicable following
the Closing, the parties shall (i) file articles of merger with respect to
the Merger (the "Articles of Merger") in such form as is required by and
executed in accordance with the Missouri Code and (ii) make all other filings
or recordings required under the laws of Missouri. The Merger shall become
effective at the date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger (or
such other date and time as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Articles of Merger as may be permitted by the Missouri
Code). The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time."   1.2. Directors and Officers. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time and until
their successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance with the laws of
Missouri or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation and after the Effective Time until such
time as their successors shall be duly elected or appointed in accordance
with the laws of Missouri or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal.    1.3. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time.   ARTICLE II.   EFFECT OF THE
MERGER ON SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY  AND MERGER SUB   2.1. Conversion of
Merger Sub Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any of the parties, each share of the common stock
of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation of the Merger.   2.2. Conversion of Common Stock. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company
together with the associated rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement
(as hereinafter defined) ("Company Common Stock"), shall be converted into
the right to receive    2   in cash from Parent, without interest, an
amount equal to $54.50 (the "Merger Consideration");   (b) As a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, at the
Effective Time all shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of a certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock,
together with a duly completed Letter of Transmittal (as defined below), or a
Letter of Transmittal with respect to shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form (the "Certificates"). To the extent that objecting
shareholders\' rights are available under Section 351.455 of the Missouri
Code, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not voted
for the approval of this Agreement and with respect to which such rights have
been properly demanded in accordance with Section 351.455 of the Missouri
Code (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless
and until the holder of such shares becomes ineligible for such rights. If a
holder of Dissenting Shares becomes ineligible under Section 351.455, then,
as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event whichever later
occurs, such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares
and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates representing such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 2.3 of this Agreement. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demand received by the Company from an
objecting shareholder of the Company demanding fair value for the
shareholder\'s Company Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, or as may otherwise be required
under applicable law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.   (c) Notwithstanding
anything contained in this section to the contrary, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and held in the Company\'s treasury or by any of the
Company\'s subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor.   (d) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any of
its subsidiaries ("Parent Subsidiaries") at the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor.   (e) The Merger Consideration shall be subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or
recapitalization after the date of this Agreement applicable to Company
Common Stock.   3    2.3. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
purpose of exchanging the Certificates for the Merger Consideration.
Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or make
available to the Paying Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send,
to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock, at the Effective
Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) for use in such
exchange (a "Letter of Transmittal").   (b) Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of his Certificate together with a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock will be entitled
to receive promptly the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by his Certificate. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.   (c) If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction
of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)
Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to or deposited with the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3 that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
his shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.3
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such
consideration without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the
holders of Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   2.4.
Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Options") which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be    4   fully vested and converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to (1) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (2) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option immediately
prior to the Effective Time.   (b) At the Effective Time, each stock
appreciation right ("SAR") granted by the Company which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the fair market value on the date of grant of each share
of Company Common Stock subject to the SAR multiplied by (2) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   2.5. Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to this Article II such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. If Parent so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Options, as the case may be, in respect of which Parent made such deduction
and withholding.   ARTICLE III.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that
the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as
set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior
to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") or as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement.   3.1. Organization and
Good Standing. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri. Each of the
Company\'s subsidiaries (the "Company Subsidiaries") is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material
Adverse Effect" shall mean a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
assets, condition (financial or otherwise), properties, liabilities, or the
results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations set
forth in this Agreement, or (iii) the ability of the Company to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Articles of
Incorporation and    5   Bylaws of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will not be amended prior to the Closing Date. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have all corporate power and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on their respective businesses substantially as now being conducted and
necessary to own, operate and lease their properties and assets.   3.2.
Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Preferred
Stock"). Of such authorized shares, as of the date hereof, there are issued
and outstanding 9,813,851 shares of Company Common Stock, 854,060 shares of
Company Common Stock are issued and held in the treasury of Company,
no shares of the Company Preferred Stock have been designated or issued, and
no other capital stock of Company is issued or outstanding. All issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive rights in compliance with applicable corporate and securities Laws
(as hereinafter defined). Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof there are no outstanding rights, including
stock appreciation rights, subscriptions, warrants, puts, calls, unsatisfied
preemptive rights, options or other agreements of any kind relating to, or
the value of which is tied to the value of, any of the outstanding,
authorized but not issued, unauthorized or treasury shares of the capital
stock or any other security of the Company, and there is no authorized or
outstanding security of any kind convertible into or exchangeable for any
such capital stock or other security. Except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no restrictions upon the transfer of or
otherwise pertaining to the securities (including, but not limited to, the
ability to pay dividends thereon) or retained earnings of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or the ownership thereof other than those imposed by the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), applicable state
securities Laws or applicable corporate Law.   3.3. Subsidiaries. Each
Company Subsidiary is wholly owned by the Company and all of the capital
stock and other interests of the Company Subsidiaries so held by the Company
are directly or indirectly owned by it, free and clear of any claim, lien,
encumbrance, security interest or agreement with respect thereto. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock in each of the Company Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly held by the Company are duly authorized, validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive rights in compliance with applicable corporate and securities
Laws. There are no irrevocable proxies or similar obligations with respect to
such capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries held by the Company and no
equity securities or other interests of any of the Company Subsidiaries are
or may become required to be issued or purchased by reason of any options,
warrants, rights to subscribe to, puts, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into
or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary,
and   6   there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any Company Subsidiary is bound to issue additional
shares of its capital stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
acquire any additional shares of its capital stock or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such shares.   3.4. Authorization; Binding
Agreement. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, but not limited to, the Merger, have been duly and validly
authorized by the Company\'s Board of Directors, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
the shareholders of Company in accordance with the Missouri Code and the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreements of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally and by principles of equity ("Enforceability
Exceptions").   3.5. Governmental Approvals. No consent, approval, waiver
or authorization of, notice to or declaration or filing with ("Consent") any
nation or government, any state or other political subdivision thereof, any
person, authority or body exercising executive, legislative, judicial,
regulatory or administrative functions of or pertaining to government
including, without limitation, any governmental or regulatory authority,

delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof will
not (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
Articles and/or Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other governing

require any Consent under or result in a violation or breach of, or

provisions of any Material Contract (as hereinafter defined) or other
material obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be

referred to in Section 3.5, above, contravene any applicable provision of any
constitution, treaty, statute, law, code, rule, regulation, ordinance, policy
or order of any Governmental Authority or other matters having the force of

Governmental Authority ("Law") currently in effect to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or its or any of their respective assets or properties
are subject, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for
any deviations from the foregoing which do not or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of August 7, 2000, by and between Ralcorp Holdings,
Inc. ("Ralcorp") and the Company and the agreements ancillary thereto to
which the Company is a party have been terminated and the Company shall have

entering into this Agreement).   3.7. Securities Filings and Litigation. The

no Consent of any person is needed in order that each such Material Contract
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms without
penalty, acceleration or rights of early termination by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Consents the absence of which would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
in violation or breach of or default under any such Material Contract; nor to
the Company\'s knowledge is any other party to any such Material Contract
in violation or breach of or default under any such Material Contract in each

described in the preceding clause, (a) any pension, profit sharing, stock
bonus, deferred or supplemental compensation, retirement, thrift, stock
purchase, stock appreciation or stock option plan, or any other compensation,
welfare, fringe benefit or retirement plan, program, policy, course of
conduct, understanding or arrangement of any kind whatsoever, whether formal
or informal, oral or written, providing for benefits for or the welfare of
any or all of the current or former employees or agents of a specified person
or their beneficiaries or dependents, (b) a multi-employer plan as defined in

determination    11   letter from the IRS that it so qualifies, and its
trust is exempt from taxation under Code Section 501(a) and, to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has since occurred to cause the loss of the Benefit
Plan\'s qualification; (ii) except for payment of benefits made in the
ordinary course of the plan administration, no event has occurred and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there exists no circumstance under which the
Company or Parent could incur liability under ERISA, the Code or otherwise;

Code has occurred; (iv) all contributions and premiums due have fully been
made and paid on a timely basis; and (v) all contributions made or required

Statements in a manner satisfying the requirements of Financial Accounting
Standards 87 and 88 except, in each case, for any deviations from the
foregoing which do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (d) No Benefit Plan is a pension plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each of the Benefit Plans has
been maintained in compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws, except
where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company does not contribute to, or have any
outstanding liability with respect to, any Multi-employer Plan.   (e) With
respect to each Benefit Plan which is a welfare plan (as defined in ERISA
Section 3(1)): (i) any liability for medical or death benefits with respect
to current or former employees beyond their termination of employment (except
as may be required by applicable Law) is provided for in the Financial
Statements to the extent required by generally accepted
accounting principles; (ii) there are no reserves, assets, surplus or prepaid
premiums under any such plan; (iii) no term or provision of any such plan
prohibits the amendment or termination thereof; (iv) Company has complied
with Code Section 4980B, except, in each case, for any deviations from the

Material Adverse Effect; and (v) each such Benefit Plan which is intended to
meet the requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter
1 of the Code meets such requirements.   (f) Except as provided in Section
5.8 below, the consummation of the Merger will not, either alone or in
conjunction with another event under the terms of any Benefit Plan: (i)
entitle any individual to severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting of benefits or increase the amount of compensation due to any
individual; or (iii) give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. William P. Stiritz is not
entitled to any additional payment or other compensation as a result of the
execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of the
actions contemplated hereunder.   12    (g) With respect to each Benefit
Plan which is contributed to or required to be maintained by the law or
applicable custom or rule of the relevant jurisdiction outside of the United
States (the "Foreign Plans") except, in each case, for any deviations from
the below which do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect:   (i) Each of the Foreign Plans is in compliance
with the provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which each such
Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those laws are applicable to the
Foreign Plans;   (ii) All contributions to, and payments from, the Foreign
Plans which may have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of
any such Foreign Plan, and, when applicable, the law of the jurisdiction in
which such Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely made or shall be made
by the Closing Date. All such contributions to the Foreign Plans, and all
payments under the Foreign Plans, for any period ending before the Closing
Date that are not yet, but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an
accrued liability on the balance sheet;   (iii) All reports, returns and
similar documents, if any, with respect to any Foreign Plan required to be
filed with any governmental body or distributed to any Foreign Plan
participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed or will be filed

obtained from the governmental body having jurisdiction with respect to such
plans any required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plans are in
compliance with the laws of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations
are required in order to give effect to the Foreign Plan;   (iv) Each of
the Foreign Plans has been administered at all times in accordance with its
terms. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending investigations
by any governmental body involving the Foreign Plans, and no pending claims
(except for claims for benefits payable in the normal operations of the
Foreign Plans), suits or proceedings against any Foreign Plan or asserting
any rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign Plan; and   (v) The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by
itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to any
Foreign Plan other than the triggering of payment to participants.   3.16.

timely filed or caused to be filed all material Tax Returns required to be

the Company will give, and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to
give, and shall direct its financial advisors, accountants and legal counsel

securities laws or the NYSE. The foregoing access will be subject
to restrictions contained in confidentiality agreements to which the Company
is subject; provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain waivers of such restrictions.   5.4. Shareholder Approval. As
soon as practicable, the Company will take all steps necessary to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of approving this Agreement and the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and for such other purposes
as may be necessary or desirable in the opinion of Parent and the Company in
connection with effectuating the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Company Proposal"). Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and
subject to the exercise of their fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors of
the Company (i) will recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they
approve the Company Proposal, and (ii)    20   will use its reasonable

Consents from Governmental Authorities required for the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) timely making all
necessary filings under the HSR Act. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to satisfy the other conditions of the Closing set forth
herein. The Company will consult with counsel for Parent as to, and
will permit such counsel to participate in, at Parent\'s expense, any
Litigation referred to in clause (ii) above brought against or involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.   5.6. Public Announcements. So long as
this Agreement is in effect, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or any
other announcement with respect to the Merger, the Company Proposal or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of Parent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except when such release
or announcement is required by applicable Law or any applicable listing
agreement with, or rules or regulations of, the NYSE or any securities
exchange, in which case the Company, to the extent practicable, prior to
making such announcement, shall consult with Parent regarding the same.  
5.7. Compliance. In consummating the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company shall comply, and/or cause the Company Subsidiaries to
comply or to be in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Laws.   5.8. Company Benefit Plans. Between the date of this Agreement
and through the Effective Time, no discretionary award or grant under any
Benefit Plan of the Company or a Company Subsidiary shall be made without the
consent of Parent; nor shall the Company or a Company Subsidiary take any
action or permit any action to be taken to accelerate the vesting of any
warrants or options previously granted pursuant to any such Benefit Plan
except as specifically required pursuant to the terms thereof as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. Other than as expressly provided in Section 5.13,
neither the Company    21   nor any Company Subsidiary shall make any
amendment to any Benefit Plan or any awards thereunder without the consent of
Parent.   5.9. Solicitation of Acquisition Proposal. (a) Subject to
compliance with Section 5.9(c), for a period of thirty (30) days from the
date of this Agreement (the "Initial Solicitation Period"), the Company shall
have the right to, directly or indirectly, take action to (1) encourage
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), solicit, initiate or
facilitate any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.9(d)), or (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information to,
any person in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the
Company and its advisors and representatives may furnish information only
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement the terms of which are no
more favorable to the other party to such confidentiality agreement than
those then in place with Parent. It is expressly understood and agreed that
subject to compliance with Section 5.9(c) and the proviso set forth in the
prior sentence, during the Initial Solicitation Period, the Company\'s
officers, directors, and financial and legal advisors shall be permitted to
actively encourage and solicit inquiries from, initiate and engage in
discussions with, and provide any information to, any party for the purpose
of receiving any Acquisition Proposal without violating this Agreement. In
the event that during the Initial Solicitation Period, the Company receives
any inquiry or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing, an "Initial Period Acquisition
Inquiry"), then, subject to compliance with Section 5.9(c) and the proviso
contained in the first sentence of this Section 5.9(a), for fifteen days
after the Initial Solicitation Period (and prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting), the Company shall have the right to (A) continue to encourage
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information) and/or facilitate the
making of Acquisition Proposals by persons that made Initial Period
Acquisition Inquiries (the "Initial Period Inquirors"), (B) continue to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information to,
the Initial Period Inquirors in connection with, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal by the Initial Period
Inquirors that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal from such Initial Period Inquirors, and (C) permit its
officers, directors, and financial and legal advisors to engage
in discussions with, and provide any information to, the Initial Period
Inquirors for the purpose of receiving Acquisition Proposals from the Initial
Period Inquirors. In the event that, during the Initial Solicitation Period
(or during the subsequent 15 days, if from an Initial Period Inquiror), the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.9(d)), then, subject to (x) compliance with
Section 5.9(c) and the proviso contained in the first sentence of this
Section 5.9(a) and (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is reasonably
likely to be necessary to do so to discharge its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company, the Company may, following the Initial
Solicitation Period and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, (A)
continue to encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information)
and/or facilitate such Acquisition Proposal,    22   (B) continue to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information
to, the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (C) permit its officers,
directors, and financial and legal advisors to engage in discussions with,
and provide any information to, the person making such Acquisition Proposal
without any violation of this Agreement.   (b) Subject to Section 5.9(a)
above, after the Initial Solicitation Period, the Company shall not, directly
or indirectly, take any action to (1) encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), solicit, initiate or facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal, (2) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or (3) participate in any way in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any information to, any person in connection
with, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so to discharge properly its
fiduciary duties to shareholders, the Company may, prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and subject to such party\'s compliance with
Section 5.9(c), (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the
person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement the terms of which are no more favorable to the
other party to such confidentiality agreement than those then in place with
Parent and (B) participate in discussions with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal. It is expressly understood and agreed that with respect to the
foregoing proviso, the Company\'s legal and financial advisors shall be able
to make inquiries, and engage in discussions, with any party that has made an
Acquisition Proposal (and such party\'s legal and financial advisors) in
order to elicit information to allow the Company\'s Board of Directors to
determine in good faith if such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal.   (c) The Company will as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within two business days) (x) communicate to
Parent any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or any of its
advisors or representatives (in each case, whether written or oral),
including the material terms of any such proposal (including any changes or
amendments thereto) and the identity of the person and its affiliates making
the same, and (y) inform Parent of any information requested from the Company
or any of its advisors or representatives, and of any negotiations or
discussions being sought to be initiated with the Company or any of its
advisors or representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will keep Parent informed of the status of any
discussions, negotiations or further inquiries regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, including, without limitation, providing Parent with copies of (x)
any written Acquisition Proposals or written indications of interest with
respect to potential Acquisition Proposals received by the Company or any of
its advisors or representatives and (y) any information delivered to any
person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal which has not been previously delivered to Parent.   23    (d)
"Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal concerning any (1) merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving the
Company, (2) sale, lease or other disposition of assets of the Company
representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, (3) issuance, sale, or other disposition of (including
by way of merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint
venture, or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company
or (4) transaction in which any person shall acquire beneficial ownership (as
such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership or any "group" (as such term is defined under
the Exchange Act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the
right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the
outstanding voting capital stock of the Company. "Superior Proposal" means a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party which was not solicited
by the Company in violation of this Agreement, its subsidiaries,
representatives or other affiliates and which, in the good faith judgment of
the Company\'s Board of Directors, taking into account, to the extent deemed
appropriate by the Company\'s Board of Directors, the various legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making such
proposal (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B) if
consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Company\'s shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders),
from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) If the Company\'s Board of Directors is prepared to accept
a Superior Proposal or to withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, its approval or recommendation of the Merger and/or
the Company Proposal, then the Company shall give Parent three business days
notice thereof and furnish Parent with a copy of an agreement the Company is
prepared to execute with respect to the transaction contemplated by
such proposal. If Parent indicates that it may make an alternative proposal,
the Company will establish an auction procedure whereby, for a period of
three business days following the day in which the Company shall have given
the notice referred to in the prior sentence, Parent and the party making the
Superior Proposal will have the opportunity to make their respective offers
to be considered by the Company. The Company shall accept the offer from such
party that the Company\'s Board of Directors shall have determined that,
if consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders (in their capacity as
shareholders) from a financial point of view. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company may not definitively accept a Superior
Proposal unless the Company concurrently therewith terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section    24    9.1(f) and, concurrently with such
termination, makes the payment required by Section 9.2(b).   5.10. SEC and
Shareholder Filings. The Company shall send to Parent a copy of all public
reports and materials as and when it sends the same to its shareholders, the
SEC or any state or foreign securities commission.   5.11. Takeover
Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the members of its
Board of Directors will grant such approvals and will take such other actions
as are necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and will otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on the Merger and any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.12 Second Supplemental Ruling Letter.   (a) The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the IRS a Second
Supplemental Ruling Letter (as defined in Section 1.4 of the Consent and
Agreement). In that regard, as promptly as possible following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company, through its outside tax counsel, Sutherland
Asbill and Brennan LLP ("SAB"), shall prepare and file a request for a Second
Supplemental Ruling Letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). The
request for such supplemental ruling letter (including any
subsequent submissions) is hereafter referred to as the "Second Supplemental
Ruling Request." In addition, the Company, through SAB, shall engage in
such discussions with the IRS as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the
obtaining of the Second Supplemental Ruling.   (b) Parent agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate fully and promptly with the Company and
SAB in reviewing drafts of the Second Supplemental Ruling Request (which
drafts shall be made available, when reasonably complete, to Parent and its
outside tax counsel, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson ("FF")), and in
otherwise responding to any reasonable requests for information that may be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation or IRS processing of
the Second Supplemental Ruling Request. Prior to being filed with the IRS,
the Second Supplemental Ruling Request, and any subsequent
written submissions that may be required by the IRS in connection with its
processing of the Second Supplemental Ruling Request, shall be approved by
Parent or FF, which approval shall be communicated in writing to SAB and
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company, through SAB, shall promptly
advise Parent, through FF, of all communications with the IRS in connection
with its processing of the Second Supplemental Ruling Request and provide
Parent and FF, with copies of all such communications that are in writing.
The Company shall provide Parent and FF reasonable notice of any meeting or
discussions with the IRS with respect to the   25   Second Supplemental
Ruling Request and give Parent and FF the opportunity to attend such meetings
and participate in such discussions. In the event that Parent seeks an
opinion of counsel with respect to the tax effect of the Merger on the
Company\'s spin-off from RP, the Company shall provide such counsel with such
representations as are reasonably necessary to support such opinion.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent in its sole
discretion may at any time agree (by providing written notice to the Company)
that the condition set forth in Section 8.3.6 may be satisfied by delivery to
RP of a Tax Opinion.   ARTICLE VI.   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF PARENT AND
MERGER SUB   Parent and Merger Sub covenant and agree as follows:   6.1.
Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company if any of the following occurs after the date of this Agreement: (i)
receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any third

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) the occurrence of an
Event which would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; (iv) the commencement or threat of any Litigation involving or
affecting Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their respective

officer of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, in his or her capacity as such or
as a fiduciary under a Benefit Plan of Parent, which relates to the
consummation of the Merger; and (v) the occurrence of any Event that would
reasonably be expected to cause a breach by Parent of any provision of this
Agreement.   6.2. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement including, but not limited
to (i) obtaining any third party Consent required in connection with the
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement or the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) the defending of any Litigation against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) obtaining all Consents from Governmental
Authorities required for the consummation of the Merger and the   
26   transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) timely making all necessary

effect, Parent shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, issue or
cause the publication of any press release or any other announcement with

unreasonably withheld or delayed, except when such release or announcement is
required by applicable Law or any applicable listing agreement with, or rules
or regulations of, the NYSE or any securities exchange, in which case Parent,
to the extent practicable, prior to making such announcement, shall consult
with the Company regarding the same.   6.4. Director and Officer Liability.
(a) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless and advance
expenses to the present and former officers and directors of the Company, and
each person who prior to the Effective Time becomes an officer or director of
the Company (each an "Indemnified Person"), in respect of acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including, without limitation, for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger) to the
fullest extent permissible under applicable law (collectively, the
"Indemnified Losses"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Indemnified Losses shall include reasonable costs of prosecuting a claim
under this Section 6.4(a). The Surviving Corporation shall periodically
advance or reimburse each Indemnified Person for all reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel constituting Indemnified Losses as such fees and expenses
are incurred; provided that such Indemnified Person shall agree to promptly
repay to the Surviving Corporation the amount of any such reimbursement if it
shall be judicially determined by judgment or order not subject to further
appeal or discretionary review that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation in connection with such
matter.   (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time (including, without limitation, for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger) covering
each Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company\'s officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount (including with respect to the payment of attorney\'s fees) no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (which
policies have been made available by the Company to Parent); provided that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such    27   insurance during such
period shall exceed 200% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company
as of the date hereof for such insurance, then the Surviving Corporation
shall provide a policy with the best coverage as shall then be available at
200% of such rate.   (c) The rights of each Indemnified Person and his or
her heirs and legal representatives under this Section 6.4 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement providing for
indemnification, or under the laws of the State of Missouri or any other
applicable Laws. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Person.   6.5. Company Employee Agreements. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance
with its terms, each existing management continuity agreement and other
severance arrangement of the Company or between the Company and any of its
officers or employees.   ARTICLE VII.   PROXY STATEMENT   Parent and
the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare and the Company shall file
with the SEC as soon as practicable a proxy statement with respect to the
Company Shareholders Meeting (the "Proxy Statement"). The parties will cause
the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts, and
Parent will cooperate with the Company, to have the Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC as promptly as practicable. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, provide copies of any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement to Parent and advise Parent of any verbal
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The
Company agrees that the Proxy Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting will not include an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that any such untrue statement of a material fact or
omission to state a material fact was made by the Company in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information concerning Parent furnished to the
Company by Parent specifically for use in the Proxy Statement. Parent agrees
that the written information provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of
mailing thereof and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, will not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without the approval of Parent. The Company will advise Parent
promptly of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses    28   thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information. Whenever any event or condition affecting the
Company or Parent occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party will promptly inform the other
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials, and in mailing to shareholders of the Company,
such amendment or supplement.   ARTICLE VIII.   CONDITIONS   8.1.

ARTICLE IX.   TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT   9.1. Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders
of the Company:   (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent;   (b)
(1) by the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein), if there has been a breach by Parent of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue, in any such case such
that Section 8.2.1 or Section 8.2.2 will not be satisfied and, in either such
case, such breach or condition has not been promptly cured within 30 days
following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach; (2) by Parent
(provided that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there has been a
breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue, in any such case such that Section 8.3.1
or Section 8.3.2 will not be satisfied and such breach or condition has not
been promptly cured within 30 days following receipt by the Company of
written notice of such breach;   (c) by either Parent or the Company if any
decree, permanent injunction, judgment, order or other action by any court of
competent jurisdiction, any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall have become final
and nonappealable (so long as the party seeking termination is not in breach
of Section 5.5 or Section 6.2 hereof);   (d) by either Parent or the
Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated before the "End Date",
which shall be April 30, 2001; provided, however, that if on April 30, 2001,
the condition to closing set forth    32   in Section 8.3.6 shall not
have been satisfied (or waived by Parent) but all other conditions to
consummation of the Merger shall have been satisfied (or waived) or shall be
capable of being satisfied, then either party shall have the right to extend
the End Date to June 30, 2001. If the Second Supplemental Ruling Letter has
not been received by June 30, 2001, but the Second Supplemental Ruling
Request is still pending at that date, Parent shall have the right to extend
the End Date until August 31, 2001 and shall have the right until August 31,
2001 to agree (by providing a written notice to the Company) that
the condition set forth in Section 8.3.6 may be satisfied by delivery to RP
of a Tax Opinion; provided, however, that, unless otherwise determined by
Parent, efforts to obtain the Second Supplemental Ruling Letter shall
continue as provided in Section 5.12 at least until August 31, 2001. If at
any time prior to August 31, 2001 the IRS communicates to the Company or SAB
that (i) for any reason, the IRS declines to rule on the Second Supplemental
Ruling Request, or (ii) the IRS has finally determined that it would rule
adversely, Parent shall be promptly notified of such communication and shall
then have 30 days (measured from the date Parent reasonably confirms based on
discussion with the IRS that the Company is unable to obtain either any
ruling or a favorable ruling (such date, the "IRS Ruling Notification
Date")), or such lesser number of days until August 31, 2001, to nonetheless
agree (by providing a written notice to the Company) that the condition set
forth in Section 8.3.6 may be satisfied by delivery to RP of a Tax Opinion.
If Parent fails to so agree by the expiration of such 30 day period (or by
August 31, 2001, if earlier), the Company shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (d), notwithstanding that the End
Date has not occurred. Parent shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (d) at any time after the IRS
Ruling Notification Date, notwithstanding that the End Date has not
occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be permitted to
extend the End Date or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph
(d) if the failure of the Effective Time to occur by the End Date shall be
due to the failure of such party to perform or observe in all material
respects the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;   (e)
by either Parent or the Company if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall fail to receive the requisite vote for approval and adoption
by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof; provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of such approval to have been
obtained;   (f) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, by the Company
concurrently with its acceptance of a Superior Proposal; or   (g) by Parent,
if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn, or modified or
changed, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its approval or
recommendation of the Merger and/or the Company Proposal.    33    9.2.
Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, there shall be no liability under this Agreement on
the part of Parent or the Company, other than the provisions of this Section
9.2, Section 10.1 and Section 10.7, and except to the extent that such
termination results from the willful and material breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.   (b) The Company and Parent agree that the Company shall
pay to Parent $10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") solely as follows: (1) if
all of the following occur (A) the Company or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or (e), (B) at any time after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting there shall
have been publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within 12 months
of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (2) if the Company shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f), or (3) if Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g).   (c) The Termination
Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(1) shall be paid to Parent
not later than five business days after the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Termination Fee to be
paid to Parent pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(2) shall be paid to Parent
concurrently with notice of termination of this Agreement by the Company. The
Termination Fee to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(3) shall be
paid to Parent no later than five business days after the Company\'s receipt
of notice of termination of this Agreement by Parent. All payments under
Section 9.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Parent.   ARTICLE X.   MISCELLANEOUS   10.1.
Confidentiality. Unless (i) otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
(ii) required by applicable Law, (iii) necessary to secure any required

in writing by Parent and the Company, this Agreement and any information or
documents furnished in connection herewith shall be kept
strictly confidential by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents. Prior to any disclosure pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
party intending to make such disclosure shall consult with the other party to
the extent practicable regarding the nature and extent of the disclosure.
Subject to the preceding sentence, nothing contained herein shall preclude
disclosures to the    34   extent necessary to comply with accounting,
SEC and other disclosure obligations imposed by applicable Law. To the extent
required by such disclosure obligations, Parent or the Company, after
consultation with the other party to the extent practicable, may file with
the SEC any written communications relating to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated under
the Securities Act. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with the other and
provide such information and documents as may be required in connection with
any such filings. In the event the Merger is not consummated, Parent and the
Company shall return to the other all documents furnished by the other and
all copies thereof made by such party and will hold in absolute confidence
all information obtained from the other party except to the extent (i) such
party is required to disclose such information by Law or such disclosure is
necessary in connection with the pursuit or defense of a claim, (ii) such
information was known by such party prior to such disclosure or was
thereafter developed or obtained by such party independent of
such disclosure, (iii) such party received such information on a non-
confidential basis from a source, other than the other party, which is not
known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation with respect
thereto or (iv) such information becomes generally available to the public or
is otherwise no longer confidential. Prior to any disclosure of information
pursuant to the exception in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the party
intending to disclose the same shall so notify the party which provided the
same to the extent practicable in order that such party may seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy should it choose to do so.   10.2.
Amendment and Modification. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by    33   a
written agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, whether before
or after approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of
the Company, except that following approval by the shareholders of the
Company, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration without further approval by the
shareholders of the Company, and no other amendment shall be made which by
law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further
approval.   10.3. Waiver of Compliance; Consents. Any failure of the Company
on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub on the other hand, to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by
Parent on the one hand, or the Company on the other hand, only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires
or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent shall be
given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this Section 10.3.   10.4. Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The respective representations and warranties
of the Company and Parent contained herein or in any certificates or other
documents delivered prior to or at the Closing shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, notwithstanding any   35   investigation
made or information obtained by the other party, but shall terminate at the
Effective Time.   10.5. Notices. All notices and other communications
