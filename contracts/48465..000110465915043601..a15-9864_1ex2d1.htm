Statement, notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement (an " _Objection
Notice_ "). The Objection Notice shall specify the items and amounts of which
aspects of the Closing Statement are being disputed and reasonably describe
the basis for such dispute. Items and amounts identified in the Closing
Statement that are not disputed by the Representative in the Objection Notice,
shall be considered final and binding on all of the parties and such items and
amounts shall not be subject to further review. If the Representative does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such forty-five (45) day period to Buyer,
then the Closing Statement shall be conclusive, final and binding on all of
the parties (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_ "). If the Representative
delivers an Objection Notice to Buyer, then Buyer and the Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Transaction Expenses and/or the Closing Net Working Capital, and any such
resolution shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties (in such
instance, a " _Final Statement_ "). In the event that Buyer and the
Representative are unable to resolve all such disagreements within fifteen
(15) days after Buyers receipt of such Objection Notice, either Buyer or the
Representative may elect that the parties shall jointly submit such remaining
disagreements to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP declines to serve, any other
nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as is reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and the Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").

 



 

(c) Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect
to the computation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Transaction Expenses and/or the Closing Net Working Capital identified in the
Objection Notice as promptly as practicable, but in any event shall direct the
Accounting Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) days after its
retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in
Buyers and the Representatives respective calculations of the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the
Closing Net Working Capital, that are identified as being items and amounts to
which Buyer and the Representative have been unable to agree. The Accounting
Firm may not consider any items or amounts that were not

 



      
 

 



 

presented on the Closing Statement or Objection Notice. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party in the Closing
Statement or the Objection Notice, as applicable, or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party in the Closing Statement or the
Objection Notice, as applicable. The Accounting Firms determination of the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Transaction Expenses
and/or the Closing Net Working Capital, as applicable, shall be based solely
on written materials submitted by Buyer and the Representative and oral
submissions made by Buyer and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent
review) and on the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review (other than with respect
to errors in arithmetic calculations) (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_
").

 



 

(d) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Transaction Expenses and/or the
Closing Net Working Capital shall be borne by Buyer and the Representative,
respectively, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm by such party that are
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted by
Buyer and the Representative.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Purchase Price_ " means the
Purchase Price as calculated based on the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Net Working Capital set
forth on any Final Statement as determined in accordance with this _Section
3.2_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price is
determined pursuant to this _Section 3.2_:

 



 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, (A)
Buyer will promptly pay to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for
payment to the Sellers, an amount equal to such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and (B) Buyer and the Representative shall provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all amounts
remaining in the Reconciliation Escrow Account to, or at the direction of, the
Representative, for payment to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
(such difference being the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Buyer and the
Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
(A) release to Buyer an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Shortfall Amount
and (y) the amount remaining in the Reconciliation Escrow Account, and (B)
release all amounts remaining in the Reconciliation Escrow Account after the
distribution described in clause (A) (if any) to, or at the direction of, the
Representative, for payment to the Sellers, in each case, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Pursuant to _Section 10.9_, Buyer shall have
recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the extent the Shortfall
Amount exceeds the Reconciliation Escrow Amount.

 



 

(f) Any payment to be made pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ shall be treated by
all parties for tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price, unless
otherwise required under applicable Law.

maintain the confidential nature of the personally identifiable information

other violation of third party Intellectual Property.

against the Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, against each other
party thereto, except to the extent such failures to be legal, valid, binding,

letter from the IRS or may rely on the opinion letter received by the pre-
approved plan sponsor from the IRS with respect to the tax-qualified status
thereof and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since
the date of the most recent determination or opinion letter relating to any
such Company Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in such
Company Pension Plan losing tax-qualified status. The Company has made
available to Buyer the most recent determination or opinion letter received

(c) None of the Company Benefit Plans or Company Employee Agreements provide
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person, other than

Person that, together with the Company is or was (within the past six (6)

plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

Company Employee Agreement exists that, as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection
with any subsequent event), would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the
payment of severance or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement to any employee or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or result in any forfeiture, payment or funding
(through a grantor trust of otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Employee Agreement with respect to any individual (other than with respect to
any portion of the Purchase Price, if any, to which such individual is
entitled as a Seller).

 



 

(g) All nonqualified deferred compensation plans (as defined in Section 409A
of the Code) of the Company are in compliance with Section 409A of the Code
and neither the Company Benefit Plans or Company Employee Agreements nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will cause a
participant in such Company Benefit Plan or Company Employee Agreement to be
subject to the tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(h) Upon the termination of any Company Benefit Plan, no benefits would be due
to any participant other than the benefits described in such Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(i) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, as of the Closing, constitute an event under any
Company Benefit Plan or Employee Agreement resulting in the payment of any
amount that may be deemed an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of
the Code.

 



 

(j) The Company has not engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any Company

Buyer hereby represents and warrants to the Company, the Blocker and the
Sellers that each statement contained in this _Article VII_ is true and
correct.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.1_ _Organization_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have an adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.2_ _Authorization of Agreement_. Buyer has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
documents, instruments, certificates, and agreements contemplated hereby to be
executed by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated this Agreement (the " _Buyer Documents_ "), and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Buyer Document by Buyer have been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary action with respect to Buyer, and
each such authorization and approval remains in full force and effect. This
Agreement has been, and each Buyer Document has been or will be at or prior to
the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer, and this
Agreement constitutes, and each Buyer Document constitutes or when so executed
and delivered will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.3_ _Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties_.

 



 

(a) None of the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement or the Buyer
Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof or thereof
will result (with or without

 



       
 

 



 

notice or lapse of time, or both) in any amendment, suspension, modification,
acceleration of rights under, the imposition of any Lien, violation of or
default under, or give rise to a right of amendment, suspension, modification,
acceleration of rights or obligations, termination, cancellation, or to impose
any Lien under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws of Buyer; (ii) any Contract or Permit to which Buyer is a party or by
which it or any of the properties or assets of Buyer is bound; (iii) any Order
applicable to Buyer or by which any of the properties or assets of Buyer is
bound; or (iv) any applicable Law, other than, in the case of clauses (ii),
(iii) and (iv), such amendments, suspensions, modifications, accelerations,
impositions, violations, defaults, terminations or cancellations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on the ability
of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) No consent, waiver, approval or authorization of, or declaration or filing
with, or notification to, any Governmental Body is required on the part of
Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Buyer Documents or the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except for compliance with the applicable requirements of
the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws and Section 13(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.4_ _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the

prohibit or restrain the ability of Buyer to enter into this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Blocker Interests for its own account, for investment purposes only and not
with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ")) thereof. Buyer
understands that the Units and the Blocker Interests have not been registered
under the Securities Act and cannot be sold, offered for sale, pledged or
otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act
or unless an exemption from such registration is available. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" (as such term is defined under Rule 501(a) of Regulation
D under the Securities Act) and possesses such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Units and the Blocker Interests.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.6_ _No Brokers_. Buyer has no obligation to any Person, directly
or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor for Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would
cause any Seller, the Company or the Blocker to become liable for payment of
any fee or expense with respect thereto.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.7_ _Sufficient Funds_. Buyer has and will have as of the Closing
cash available or existing borrowing facilities which together are and will be
sufficient to pay all amounts to be paid by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement and the other Buyer Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the payment by Buyer of all obligations pursuant
to _Section 2.3(a)_ _,_ and Buyers costs and expenses on the terms and
conditions contained in this Agreement, and there is not, nor will there be,
any restriction on the use of such cash for such purpose.

 



      
 

 



 

 _SECTION 7.8_ _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Article V_, at Closing, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and the Company (a) will be solvent (in
that both the fair value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its
debts and the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than
the amount required to pay its probable liabilities on its debts as they
become absolute and matured); (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity
with which to engage in its business; and (c) will not have incurred and will
not incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

 



 

 _SECTION 7.9_ _Condition of the Business_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges that none of
the Company, the Blocker, any Seller, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person is making any representations or warranties whatsoever,
express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Sellers in _Article
IV_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) or in the Seller Documents, the
Company in _Article V_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) or in the
Company Documents and the Blocker in _Article VI_ (as modified by the
Disclosure Schedules) or in the Blocker Documents. Buyer further acknowledges
that none of the Company, the Blocker, any Seller, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Sellers, the Company, the Blocker or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, not expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller Documents, the Company Documents or the Blocker Documents, and none of
the Company, the Blocker, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or representatives of, or Buyers or any such other Persons use of, any such
information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of the
Company or other publications or data room information provided to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or representatives, or any other document or information
in any form provided to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

respect to any confidential and non-public information that is a trade secret
under applicable Law, the following obligations will remain in effect so long
as such information remains a trade secret), each Seller will keep
confidential and not disclose, any confidential and non-public information of
the Company or the Blocker, except (i) to the extent such information becomes
available to such Seller after Closing as a result of disclosure not known by
such recipient to have been improper or generally known to the public or (ii)
as required by Law, regulation, legal process or Proceeding, in which case, to
the extent practicable, such Seller will provide Buyer notice and such Seller
will cooperate with Buyers reasonable efforts to contest and oppose such
disclosure, at Buyers expense.

 



 

 _SECTION 8.7_ _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
(i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Closing is, or at
any time prior to the Closing was, a director, manager or officer of the
Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director, manager or officer of the Company or
(B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a
director, manager, officer, employee or agent of the Company or taken at the
request of the Company (including in connection with serving at the request of
the Company as a director, manager, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
(including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing as provided in (x) the
Companys organizational documents as currently in effect and (y) any other
indemnification arrangements between the Company and the Indemnitees, which
arrangements shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, for the six
(6)-year period commencing at the Closing, shall cause the organizational
documents of the Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors, managers
and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the organizational documents of the Company, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from
and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, pay any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee
under this _Section 8.7_ (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 8.7_) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
the person to whom expenses are advanced or paid provides an

 



      
 

 



 

undertaking to repay such advances or payments to the extent required by
applicable Law or the organizational documents of the Company.

 



 

(b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any Proceeding relating to any acts or omissions
covered under this _Section 8.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel selected
by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be permitted to participate in the
defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each of Buyer, the Company and the
Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain, at the expense of the
Company (which shall be a Transaction Expense), a "tail" policy in respect of
the existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by the Company, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date to
provide insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional
persons who prior to the Closing become) covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to
such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such individuals than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. Buyer shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause
all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Company.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Buyer and the Company
under this _Section 8.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section
8.7_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this _Section 8.7_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 8.7_).

 



 

 _SECTION 8.8_ _Publicity_. No party hereto shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of Buyer and the
Representative, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, unless, in
the judgment of counsel to the applicable party, public disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange, _provided_ that, to the extent required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange, the party intending to make such
release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
applicable Law to consult with Buyer and the Representative with respect to
the text thereof. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a
form mutually agreed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto may
disclose the terms of this Agreement to their respective employees,
accountants, advisors, general and limited partners, Affiliates and

 



      
 

 



 

other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of
their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by
contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential).

 



 

 _SECTION 8.9_ _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to each of the Employees who is
an employee of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and
continues to be employed by the Company after the Closing Date (the "

(a) In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to induce Buyer
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) each Unit Seller
(other than Weiser and Stephen M. McDonnell) hereby agrees that, during the
period beginning immediately following the Closing and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) each of Weiser and Stephen M.
McDonnell hereby agrees that during the period beginning immediately following
the Closing and ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
such Unit Seller shall not, and such Unit Seller shall not cause any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, own, operate, be a partner,
shareholder, co-venturer or otherwise invest in, lend money to, consult with,
manage or render services to, act as agent for, or acquire or hold any
interest in, any Person that engages in the Covered Business in North America
without the consent of Buyer; _provided_ , that such Seller may own up to five
percent (5%) of any class of securities that is listed or admitted to trading
on a national securities exchange. For this purpose " _Covered Business_ "

employee employed by the Company; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
prohibit any Seller from (i) conducting a general solicitation of prospective
employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice if
not specifically directed towards any employees of the Company or hiring any
Person where the initial contact with such Person regarding such hiring
primarily arose as a result of such general solicitation or (ii) soliciting or
hiring any individual whose employment with the Company is terminated.

 



 

(c) During the period beginning immediately following the Closing and ending
on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Stephen M.
McDonnell nor Weiser shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, request or advise
any key customer, key supplier or other key business contact of the Company to
cancel, curtail or otherwise materially and adversely change its business or
relationship with the Company.

 



 

(d) During the period beginning immediately following the Closing and ending
on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) no Seller shall
publicly disparage by any means (whether written or oral) the Company or any
aspect of the Companys management, policies, operations, products, services
or practices in a manner that has or would reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

have a material adverse effect on the Company and (ii) none of Buyer or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall publicly disparage by any
means (whether written or oral) any Seller in a manner that has or would
reasonably have a material adverse effect on such Seller.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 8.13(f)_, each Seller, on behalf of such Seller, such
Sellers estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives and
trusts (as applicable), and such Sellers successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Releasing Persons_ "), hereby absolutely and
unconditionally releases, waives and forever discharges each Releasee of and
from any and all Proceedings, Losses, debts, sums of money, accounts, bonds,
bills, rights, covenants, Contracts, obligations, controversies, entitlements,
promises, benefits, awards, decisions, Orders, subpoenas and verdicts
whatsoever, whether state or federal, in law or in equity, known or unknown,
asserted or unasserted, suspected or unsuspected, liquidated or unliquidated,
absolute or contingent, which the Releasing Persons ever had or may now have
against any Releasee for, upon, arising out of, based in whole or in part
upon, or by reason of the ownership (or any claimed ownership) by such Seller
at any time at or before the Closing of any equity interest of the Company,
the Blocker or any of their predecessor entities (by merger, asset purchase or
otherwise) (or any other equity interest or right to purchase an equity
interest in the Company or the Blocker), such Sellers status as a member of
the Company, or such Sellers status as a stockholder of the Blocker, in each
case arising out of any act or omission occurring at any time at or before the
Closing;

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.13(e)_, _Section
8.13(e)_ shall not limit, reduce or otherwise affect any right or remedy of
any Seller (1) arising under this Agreement or any Seller Document or (2) to
be indemnified as an officer, director or manager of the Company or the
Blocker under applicable Law or the Companys or the Blockers organizational
documents.

 



 

(g) For purposes of _Section 8.13(e)_ " _Releasees_ " shall mean (1) Buyer,
the Company, the Blocker and each of their respective past, present and future
Affiliates, related entities and subsidiaries, (2) each of the respective
past, present and future employees, officers, directors, managers, members,
shareholders, equity holders, partners, agents, representatives, successors
and assigns of the entities described in _Section 8.13(g)(1)_ above, and (c)
any company providing insurance to any of the foregoing in the past, present
or future (other than with respect to the "tail" policy described in _Section
8.7(c)_).

 



 

(h) The Sellers acknowledge that (1) the covenants set forth in this _Section
8.13_ are reasonable and an essential element of this Agreement, (2) but for
the agreement of the Sellers to comply with these covenants, Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement and (3) breach of this _Section 8.13_ will
harm Buyer to such an extent that monetary damages alone would be an
inadequate remedy and Buyer would not have an adequate remedy at law.
Therefore, in the event of a breach by any Seller of this _Section 8.13_, (1)
Buyer (in addition to all other remedies Buyer may have) will be entitled to
seek an injunction and other equitable relief restraining any Seller from
committing or continuing such breach and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and its terms and (2) the duration of any period in _Sections
8.13(a)_ , _8.13(b)_ and _8.13(c)_ will be extended beyond its then-
scheduled termination date for a period equal to the duration of such breach,
as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) If any provision contained in this _Section 8.13_ is held by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because of the duration of such
provision, the geographic area covered thereby or otherwise, the court making
such determination shall have the power to, and is hereby directed by the
parties to, reduce the duration or geographic area of such provision or
otherwise modify such provision, and, in its reduced or modified form, such
provision shall be enforceable. In addition, upon a determination that any
such term or other provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 _SECTION 8.14_ _No Shop_. Throughout the period that begins on the date
hereof and ends upon the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, no Seller will, and no Seller will
authorize the Company or the Blocker or any representative or agent of such
Seller, the Company or the Blocker to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish any
information to or participate in any discussion or negotiation with any Person
(other than Buyer or any Person on Buyers behalf) regarding any acquisition
of the Companys or Blockers equity interests, assets or business, in whole
or in part (by purchase, merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange, joint
venture or otherwise), except for sales of assets in the Ordinary Course of
Business. Each Seller will, and each Seller will cause the Company and the
Blocker and the other representatives and agents of such Seller, the Company
and the Blocker to, immediately terminate all such discussions or negotiations
that may be in progress on the date hereof.

 



 

 _SECTION 8.15_ _Notices_. Throughout the period that begins on the date
hereof and ends upon the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, the Company shall notify Buyer as
promptly as practicable after receiving written notice from a Customer or
Supplier reducing, making a material adverse change in, canceling or otherwise
terminating its relationship with the Company or threatening to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

 _SECTION 8.16_ _Delivery of 2014 Audited Financial Statements_. Within ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Buyer
copies of the audited balance sheet of the Company as of December 26, 2014 and
the related statements of income and members equity and cash flows of the
Company for the fifty-two (52) weeks ended December 26, 2014, in each case,
which are consistent with the 2014 Financial Statements.

 



 

 _SECTION 8.17_ _Advisory Committee_. Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall
cause the board of directors of the Company to (i) adopt the Advisory
Committee Charter set forth on Exhibit F and (ii) form the advisory committee
contemplated in the Advisory Committee Charter consisting of the initial

board of directors of the Company to keep the Advisory Committee Charter and
advisory committee in place for a period of at least three (3) years following

of Buyer on or before the date hereof or at or before Closing. All
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein will be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed material and relied upon by each party hereto, and none will be waived
by any failure to pursue any action or consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, except to the extent stated herein.

 



 

(k) _Recoveries_. The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article X_
shall be determined net of (i) any Tax benefit arising in connection with

as an offset to any Tax by the applicable Claiming Party or any of its
Affiliates for the Taxable year the Loss is incurred and (ii) any insurance
proceeds actually received by a Claiming Party from a third-party insurer
(after giving effect to any deductible) for the Losses giving rise to the
right of indemnification (less any directly related out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and fees resulting from or incurred in connection with such insurance
claim or claims). The existence or potential existence of monies from an
insurer shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification
provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing to a
Claiming Party, it being understood that a Claiming Party shall have no
obligation to first seek recovery from a third party or submit or to collect
upon any applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Losses thereof. The
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the efforts to mitigate any claim,
liability or indemnifiable Losses that are entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall be included in the amount of indemnifiable Losses. If a
Claiming Party actually receives proceeds or payment in respect of
indemnifiable Losses after payment from the Indemnifying Party for such
Losses, the Claiming Party will pay as promptly as practicable to the
Indemnifying Party such proceeds or payment (less any directly related out-of-
pocket costs, expenses and fees resulting from or incurred in connection with
such insurance claim or claims) to the extent of the prior payment from the
Indemnifying Party.

herein and each covenant and agreement to be performed prior to the Closing
will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and remain in full
force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date, at which time such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement will
expire and terminate and no indemnification obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon, except that (i) each Fundamental Representation
(other than the Tax Representations) will survive until the date that is six
(6) years after the Closing Date and (ii) each Tax Representation will survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(b) _Survival of Representations and Warranties Until Final Determination_.
Notwithstanding _Section 10.4(a)_, for each claim for indemnification
hereunder regarding a representation or warranty or covenant or agreement that
is made before expiration of such representation or warranty or covenant or
agreement, such claim and associated right to indemnification for such claim
(including any right to pursue such indemnification, including via any
Proceeding) will not terminate before final determination and satisfaction of
such claim.

 



 

(c) _Survival of Covenants and Agreements_. Each covenant and agreement set
forth in this Agreement (other than representations or warranties or the
covenants and

 



      
 

 



 

agreements to be performed prior to the Closing), and all associated rights to
indemnification, will survive Closing and will continue in full force
thereafter pursuant to the terms thereof.

 



 

 _SECTION 10.5_ _Notice of Claims and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Claims_. A Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
_Claiming Party_") will give to the Representative (if the Indemnifying Party
is a Seller) and each other Person obligated to provide such indemnification
(the " _Indemnifying Party_") prompt notice of any claim, for which such
Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification, (1) by a Person that is not
a party hereto or Other Indemnified Person (such a claim being a " _Third
Party Claim_" and such notice of such Third Party Claim being the " _Initial
Claim Notice_") or (2) that does not involve a Third Party Claim, in each case
specifying in reasonable detail the amount and nature of, and the facts and
circumstances giving rise to, such claim (to the extent known), a reference to
the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based and such other
information with respect thereto as the Representative (if the Indemnifying
Party is a Seller) or the Indemnifying Person may reasonably request.
Thereafter, the Claiming Party will give the Indemnifying Party, promptly
after the Claiming Partys (or any of its applicable Other Indemnified
Persons) receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all documents (including
court papers) received or delivered by the Claiming Party (or any such Other
Indemnified Person) relating to any such Third Party Claim. The failure to
promptly give such notice or to promptly give such copies will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except, and only to the extent
that, the Indemnifying Party was adversely affected or prejudiced by such
failure.

 



 

(b) _Access and Cooperation_. Each Claiming Party and Indemnifying Party will,
and will cause its Other Indemnified Persons to, cooperate and assist in all
reasonable respects regarding such Third Party Claim, including by promptly
making available to each other (and each others legal counsel and other
professional advisers with a reasonable need to know) all books and records in
its possession or control relating to such Third Party Claim, subject to
reasonable confidentiality precautions.

 



 

(c) _Defense and Participation_.

 



 

(i) _Election to Conduct Defense_. After receiving an Initial Claim Notice
under _Section 10.5(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will have the option,
exercisable by written notice to the Claiming Party within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Initial Claim Notice, to conduct the defense of such Third
Party Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party, at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, except if (A) the Claiming Party and
the Other Indemnified Persons have certified to the Indemnifying Party that
(x) the aggregate amount of the reasonable potential obligations of the
Claiming Party (or its Other Indemnified Persons) regarding such Third Party
Claim exceeds the then-current balance (less any other pending claims) of the
Indemnification Escrow Account and (y) recovery of such Third Party Claim is
limited to the Indemnification Escrow Account, (B) such Third Party Claim
seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or
specific performance against the Claiming Party (or any of its Other
Indemnified Persons) or other material non-monetary damages, restrictions or
limitations on the Claiming Party (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons)
other than non-disparagement, non-disclosure and other customary

 



      
 

 



 

settlement terms, or (C) that involves criminal allegations against the
Claiming Party. To elect to conduct such defense, the Indemnifying Party must
give written notice of such election to the Claiming Party within thirty (30)
days after the Claiming Party gives the corresponding Initial Claim Notice to
the Indemnifying Party (otherwise, such right to conduct such defense will be
deemed waived). If the Indemnifying Party validly makes such election, it will
nonetheless lose such right to conduct such defense if it fails to conduct
such defense in a reasonably active and diligent manner.

 



 

(ii) _Conduct of Defense, Participation and Settlement_. If the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim, then (A) the Claiming
Party may participate, at its own expense (except that the Indemnifying Party
will be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Claiming Partys counsel
(but not more than one law firm per jurisdiction) if the Claiming Party
reasonably concludes that there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party in the defense of such Third Party
Claim), in such defense (including any Proceeding regarding such Third Party
Claim) and will have the right to receive copies of all notices, pleadings or
other similar submissions regarding such defense, (B) the Indemnifying Party
will keep the Claiming Party reasonably informed of all matters material to
such defense and Third Party Claim at all stages thereof, (C) the Claiming
Party will not (and will cause its Other Indemnified Persons not to) admit
liability with respect to, or compromise or settle, such Third Party Claim
without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (D) there will be no compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Claiming Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)

 



 

(iii) _Indemnifying Party Does Not Conduct Defense_. If the Indemnifying Party
does not have the option to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim or
does not validly elect such option or does not preserve such option (including
by failing to commence such defense within thirty (30) days following receipt
of such Initial Claim Notice), then (A) the Indemnifying Party may
participate, at its own expense, in such defense (including any Proceeding
regarding such Third Party Claim) and will have the right to receive copies of
all notices, pleadings or other similar submissions regarding such defense,
(B) the Claiming Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of
all matters material to such defense and Third Party Claim at all stages
thereof, (C) the Indemnifying Party will not admit liability with respect to,
or compromise or settle, such Third Party Claim without the Claiming Partys
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (D) there will be no compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

 _SECTION 10.6_ _Materiality Qualifiers_. Solely for the purposes of this
_Article X_ and solely for the purposes of determining the amount of any
Losses (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining if
such an inaccuracy or breach has occurred), all qualifications to any
representation or warranty (other than the representations or warranties set
forth in _Section 5.5_ ( _Financial Statements_ ), _5.7_ ( _Absence of
Certain Developments_ ), _5.20_ ( _Suppliers_ ), _5.21_ ( _Customers_ ) and
the definition of "Material Contracts") by use of the word "material,"
"materially" or other variations of the root word "material" or by a reference
regarding the occurrence or non-occurrence or possible occurrence or non-
occurrence of a

 



       
 

 



 

Material Adverse Effect or a "materially adverse effect" will be ignored and
each representation and warranty will be read and interpreted without regard
to any such qualification.

 



 

 _SECTION 10.7_ _Effect of Purchase Price Calculation_. To avoid double
counting, any Loss for which a Person would otherwise be obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder will be offset to the extent (but only to the
extent) such Loss is reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price under
_Article III_.

 



 

 _SECTION 10.8_ _Indemnification Adjusts Purchase Price for Tax Purposes_.
Indemnification payments under this Agreement will be treated (including
retroactively) as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the
extent permitted under applicable Law.

 



 

 _SECTION 10.9_ _Reconciliation Escrow Amount and Indemnification Escrow
Amount_. The Reconciliation Escrow Amount will be used only for matters
arising out of, relating to or resulting from _Section 3.2_. The
Indemnification Escrow Amount may be used for matters arising out of or
resulting from _Section 3.2_ to the extent the Reconciliation Escrow Amount
has been depleted. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (and the Escrow
Agreement), Buyer or Buyers Other Indemnified Persons may seek disbursement
for any Sellers indemnification obligation under _Section 10.1_ (other than
_Section 10.1(b)(ii)_) from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, without regard
to whether fewer than all Sellers owe the related indemnification obligation
to Buyer or Buyers Other Indemnified Persons and without regard to whether
such obligation is several and not joint. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer and Buyers Other Indemnified Persons must seek
disbursement for any Sellers indemnification obligation under _Section
10.1(a)_ first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount. Disbursements from such
escrow accounts will occur pursuant to the applicable terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the escrow accounts
are the sole source of funds for Sellers obligations under _Section 3.2_,
(ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount is the sole source of funds for any
Losses that are indemnifiable under _Section 10.1(d)_ and (iii) Buyers sole
recourse for any Sellers indemnification obligation under _Section
10.1(b)(ii)_ is against the applicable breaching Seller; provided that if a
Sellers indemnification obligation under _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_ is unpaid or
unresolved as of the Indemnification Escrow Release Date, (i) the amount of
cash in escrow that would otherwise be released to such Seller shall be
reduced by (x) the amount of the unpaid indemnification obligations under
_Section 10.1(b)(ii)_ owed by such Seller and such amount shall, instead, be
used to satisfy such unpaid indemnification obligations, if any, and (y) the
amount of unresolved indemnfication claims made by Buyer or Buyers Other
Indemnified Persons under _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_ against such Seller prior to
that time (and such funds subject to unresolved claims shall remain in the
Indemnification Escrow Account until the resolution thereof), if any, and (ii)
the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent issued by Buyer and the
Representative shall provide for the adjustments and payments required by the
foregoing clause (i).

 **ARTICLE XI**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

 _SECTION 11.1_ _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated
and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned any time prior to
the Closing as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) by the Representative or Buyer on or after August 24, 2015 (the " _Outside
Date_ ") if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on
such date; _provided_ that if the DOJ or FTC issue a "second request" under
the HSR Act, such Outside Date shall be extended until February 22, 2016;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 11.1(a)_ shall not be available to the Representative or
Buyer, as applicable, if the principal reason the Closing shall not have
occurred by such time is the breach by such party (including the Sellers, the
Company and the Blocker, in the case of the Representative) of any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(b) by mutual written consent of the Representative and Buyer;

 



 

(c) by the Representative or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)_ shall not be available to the
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, if the issuance of such final
nonappealable Order was primarily due to the breach by such party (including
the Sellers, the Company and the Blocker, in the case of the Representative)
of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by Buyer if (i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_, is
incapable of fulfillment by the Outside Date, or if the breach giving rise to
the failure of any such conditions to be satisfied is incurable by the Outside
Date; or

 



 

(e) by the Representative if (i) none of the Sellers, the Blocker or the
Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and (ii) any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.2_ is incapable of fulfillment by the
Outside Date, or if the breach giving rise to the failure of any such
conditions to be satisfied is incurable by the Outside Date.

 



 

 _SECTION 11.2_ _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by Buyer or the Representative, or both, pursuant to _Section
11.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to Representative by
Buyer (in the event Buyer terminates this Agreement) or by the Representative
to Buyer (in the event that the Representative terminates this Agreement), and
this Agreement shall terminate, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be abandoned, without further action by the parties.

 



 

 _SECTION 11.3_ _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 11.1_, this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any stockholder,
director, manager, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of
such party) to the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, if such termination shall result from
the failure of any party to perform an agreement or covenant contained herein,
such party shall not be relieved of any liability as a result of such failure
or breach; _provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions of _Section 8.8_,
this _Section 11.3_, _Article I_ and _Article XII_ and the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 _SECTION 12.1_ _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the sales, use, transfer, intangible,
recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges of any nature
whatsoever (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax),
applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by each of Buyer and Sellers.
Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with respect to all filings, Tax
Returns, reports and forms as may be required with respect to all such Taxes.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.2_ _Expenses_. Except as is expressly stated otherwise herein,
each party to this Agreement shall bear its respective fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including legal, accounting, financial advisor and other professional fees),
except Sellers will bear all such fees costs and expenses of the Company and
the Blocker. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall pay and be solely
responsible for all filing fees payable under the HSR Act.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.3_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules
and exhibits hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, and each other agreement,
document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or to be executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, represent the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements among
the parties respecting the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations respecting the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the other agreements, documents, instruments and certificates contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.4_ _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by Buyer
and the Representative. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.5_ _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.6_ _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Any litigation against any party to
this Agreement arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall
be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware located in New Castle County) (together
with the appellate courts thereof, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and each of the
parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for
the purpose of any such litigation. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in any Chosen Court, (b) any claim that any such
litigation brought in any Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum and (c) any claim that any Chosen Court does not have jurisdiction with
respect to such litigation. To the extent that service of process by mail is
permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any such litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its address
for notices provided for herein.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.7_ _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered
personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by

transmission) or (iii) one (1) Business Day following the day sent by
overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each case to the

have specified by notice given to the other parties pursuant to this
provision):

 _SECTION 12.8_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.9_ _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as contemplated by
_Section 8.7_ ( _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_ ) and for the
Other Indemnified Persons (each of which provisions is intended to be for the
benefit of the Persons referred to therein and may be enforced by any such
Person), nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the

 



      
 

 



 

contrary, prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to enforce
the rights of the Sellers to pursue damages in the event of Buyers breach of
this Agreement. In addition, the Representative shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to enforce any rights of the Sellers under this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by any party, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.10_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. A signature delivered by facsimile or by
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance thereof shall be deemed to be an original signature.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.11_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents, any
Blocker Documents, any Seller Documents, any Buyer Documents or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereto (i) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the other documents contemplated hereby, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 12.11_.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.12_ _Representative_.

 



 

(a) Without any further act of any Seller, Weiser is hereby irrevocably
appointed as the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the Sellers to act as
the initial Representative under this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.12_. The
Representative may resign upon written notice to all Sellers. The
Representative may be changed or replaced by vote of a majority of Sellers
(computed on the basis of their respective Pro Rata Portions) upon written
notice to the Representative. The Representative will immediately inform Buyer
in the event of the Representatives removal or resignation. In the event of
the resignation or removal of the Representative, a successor Representative
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer shall thereafter be appointed by an
instrument in writing signed by Buyer and such successor Representative.

 



 

(b) The Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act for, and on
behalf of, any and all of the Sellers (with full power of substitution in the
premises) in connection with such matters as are reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby including: (i) to receive all payments owing to the
Sellers under this Agreement, (ii) to terminate, amend, waive any provision
of, or abandon, this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby,
(iii) to act as the representative of the Sellers to review and authorize all
claims and disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (iv) to negotiate and
compromise on their behalf with Buyer any claims asserted hereunder and to
authorize payments to be made with respect thereto, (v) to take such

 



      
 

 



 

further actions as are authorized in this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby, and (vi) in general, do all things and perform all acts,
including executing and delivering all agreements (including the Escrow
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated in this Agreement),
certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions and other documents
contemplated by, or deemed by the Representative to be necessary or desirable
in connection with, this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby
and the transactions contemplated herein or therein. Buyer shall be entitled
to rely on such appointment and to treat the Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Seller. Notices given to the Representative
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute notice to
the Sellers for all purposes under this Agreement. In all matters relating to
this Section, the Representative will be the only party entitled to assert the
rights of Sellers. The Representative will have no power or authority to bind
Buyer, and Buyer will not have any liability to any person for any act or
omission by the Representative.

 



 

(c) The appointment of the Representative is an agency coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Representative
pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 12.12_ shall be effective
and absolutely binding on each Seller notwithstanding any contrary action of
or direction from such Seller. The death or incapacity, or dissolution or
other termination of existence, of any Seller shall not terminate the
authority and agency of the Representative. Buyer and any other party to any
document contemplated by this Agreement in dealing with the Representative may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any act, statement,
action, representation, or decision of the Representative as being the binding
acts of all Sellers or any of them, notwithstanding any communication from any
Seller to the contrary (other than communication regarding the resignation or
removal of the Representative pursuant to this Section).

 



 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Seller or any other Person
(other than Buyer) with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Representative in its role as Representative under or in connection with
this Agreement, unless such action or omission results from or arises out of
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Representative, and
the Representative shall not be liable to any Seller in the event that, in the
exercise of its reasonable judgment, the Representative believes there will
not be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to
contest a claim made by Buyer. Sellers shall be responsible to Buyer for any
breach by the Representative of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) The Representative shall be indemnified from the Sellers for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred by the Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this _Section 12.12_ (the " _Representative Expenses_ "). In
addition, the Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Representative Expense Amount for the Representative Expenses.

 



 

(f) As soon as practical following the later of (i) the date that is twenty-
four (24) months after the Closing Date and (ii) the final resolution of all
indemnification claims made under this Agreement that are outstanding as of
the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, the
Representative shall pay or cause to be paid the unused portion of the

 



       
 

 



 

Representative Expense Amount (if any) to the Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.13_ _Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) In any dispute or Proceeding arising after the Closing under or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated
hereby, the parties agree that any of the Sellers shall have the right, at its
election, to retain any Law Firm to represent such Seller in such matter, and
Buyer and the Company (on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates,
directors, managers, officers, employees and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns) hereby irrevocably waive and consent to any
such representation in any such matter.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that all communications solely between
any Law Firm and the Company or any Law Firm and any Seller in connection with
this Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby, together
with the attorney-client privilege related thereto (if any), the expectation
of client confidence related thereto (if any) and all other rights to any
evidentiary privilege related thereto, belong to such Seller, and shall not
pass to or be claimed by the Company or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are consummated:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have no right of access to or control over any of the
records of the Law Firms related to such transactions, which shall become the
property of (and be controlled by) the Sellers, as applicable; and

 



 

(ii) it would be impracticable to remove from the records (including emails
and other electronic files) of the Company any communications with or among
any Law Firm, the Company and any Seller. The Company and Buyer agree not to
access, review or otherwise use, examine or rely upon such communications that
may remain in the records of the Company, and the parties agree that no
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or other privilege or
protection is waived or intended to be waived by allowing such material to
remain in the files of the Company.

 



 

(d) Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between any of the Sellers, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to
any matter in which any Law Firm acted for them both, none of the attorney-
client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any other rights to
any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to the Sellers, as
applicable, any information or documents developed or shared during the course
of either Law Firms joint representation of the Sellers and the Company.

 



 

 _SECTION 12.14_ _Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions, to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by any other party and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other party,
in the Chosen Courts, and appropriate injunctive relief (including any Order
sought by the Company and/or the Representative to cause Buyer to perform its
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement) may be applied for and
granted in connection therewith. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives: (i)
any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense
that a remedy at law would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement to post a
bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
