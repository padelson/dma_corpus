been issued, the apportionment shall be based on the amounts that Sagicor
Parties paid in the immediately preceding period, with a re-proration
subsequent to Closing within thirty (30) days after a final tax bill has been
received by Playa. Any property tax in respect of periods prior to the Closing
Date will be the responsibility of the Sagicor Parties. Taxes for any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on the Cut-Off Time) shall be allocated
to the period prior to the Closing Date based on the amount of such taxes for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the portion of such period ending on the Cut-Off Time
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such period. In
the event that the Real Property or any part thereof shall be or shall have
been affected by an assessment or assessments, whether or not the same become

be responsible for any such assessment (or any installments thereof) due
prior to the Cut-Off Time and Playa shall be responsible for any such
assessment (or any installments thereof) due on or after the Cut-Off Time, and

apportioned hereunder, then the Sagicor Parties shall endeavor to cause such
meters to be read as of the Cut-Off Time, and the Sagicor Parties shall pay
all utility charges relating to the period before such meter reading upon
receipt of statements therefor. Playa shall be responsible for all utilities
charges from and after the Cut-Off Time. To the extent any such meters are
not read as of the Cut-Off Time, the corresponding charges shall be prorated

reasonably approved by both Playa and the Sagicor Parties based on prior bills
with respect thereto. Any deposits or credits made or issued with respect to
the foregoing services relating to the period prior to the Cut-Off Time shall
be credited to the Sagicor Parties to the extent that Playa will be entitled
to the benefits of such deposits or credits by the applicable service
provider. Upon the taking of a subsequent actual reading, such apportionment
shall be adjusted to reflect the actual rate for the billing period in which
the Cut-Off Time occurs, and the Sagicor Parties, or Playa, as the case may
be, shall promptly deliver to the other the amount determined to be due upon
such adjustment.

any such delinquent rents without being liable to the Sagicor Parties
therefor. To the extent Sagicor Newco or Playa receives payments on or after
the Closing Date from a tenant that was delinquent at the Closing, such
payments shall be applied as follows: (1) first, to any amounts applicable to
periods after the Cut-Off Time; (2) second, to any amounts applicable to

account receivables due on accounts accruing subsequent to the Cut-Off Time
and then to Sellers Accounts Receivable, provided further that with respect
to any tour operator Receivables which are paid to Playa following the Closing

Parties any Receivables actually received which are applicable to a period
prior to the Cut-Off Time in the order as such Receivables are received and

Parties.

constitutes valuable trade secrets of the Sagicor Parties and Sagicor Newco,
which affect, among other things, the successful conduct, furtherance and
protection of the Business. The Sagicor Parties further acknowledge that they
have knowledge of certain Confidential Information that is confidential and
proprietary to Playa. The Sagicor Parties acknowledge that the unauthorized
use or disclosure of Confidential Information is likely to be highly
prejudicial to the interests of Playa, Sagicor Newco and their respective
owners, executive officers, directors, managers, customers, clients,
licensees, licensors and suppliers, an invasion of privacy or an improper
disclosure of trade secrets. The Sagicor Parties agree that a substantial
portion of transaction consideration is being paid for the Confidential
Information relating to Sagicor Newco and the Business and that the
Confidential Information (i) represents a substantial investment having great
economic and commercial value to Playa, and (ii) constitutes a substantial
part of the value to Playa of the Property being acquired. The Sagicor Parties
further acknowledge that Playa would be irreparably damaged if any of the
Confidential Information was disclosed to, or used or exploited on behalf of,
any Person other than Playa or any of its Affiliates. Accordingly, the Sagicor
Parties covenant and agree that they shall not, directly or indirectly, and
shall use their best efforts to ensure that none of their Affiliates, agents,
consultants, advisors or representatives, without the prior written consent of
Playa, discloses, uses, exploits, furnishes or makes accessible to
any Person, any such Confidential Information, for the benefit of any such
Person or of any of such other third party, at any time for so long as such
information shall remain secret or confidential or otherwise remain wholly or
partially protectable except that any Sagicor Party may use or exploit a
particular item of Confidential Information to the extent in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and to the extent (but only if and to the extent) that
such item is:

 

(1) or becomes generally known on a non-confidential basis to Persons in the
industry, through no wrongful act of any Sagicor Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates, agents, consultants, advisors or representatives, in
which Playa or any Sagicor Party is engaged and is part of the public domain;
or

 

(2) or becomes available to a Sagicor Party on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than any Sagicor Party or Playa or any of their respective
Affiliates, agents or representatives, provided that such source is not bound
by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to any Sagicor Party or Playa or any other
Person with respect to such information

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Sagicor Party or any
of its Affiliates, agents or representatives is required by Law or the rules
of any stock exchange or order of a court of competent jurisdiction to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Sagicor Party will
promptly notify Playa in writing so that Playa may seek a protective order
and/or other motion filed to prevent the production or disclosure of
Confidential Information. If such motion is denied, such Sagicor Party (or any
such Affiliate, agent or representative thereof) may disclose only such
portion of the Confidential Information which (i) in the written opinion of
its legal counsel is required by Law to be disclosed or (ii) Playa consents,
in writing, to having disclosed; provided, however, that (A) such Sagicor
Party will use all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
remainder of the Confidential Information and (B) such Sagicor Party will not
oppose any motion for confidentiality brought by Playa in any such

 



44  instance. The Sagicor Parties shall continue to be bound by their
obligations pursuant to this Section for any Confidential Information that is
not required to be disclosed pursuant to clause (i) in the immediately
preceding sentence, or that has been afforded protective treatment pursuant to
such motion.

contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are integral to completion of the
transaction contemplated herein by Playa and that without the protection of
such covenants, Playa would not have entered into this Agreement. The Sagicor
Parties hereby further acknowledge that money damages will be impossible to
calculate and may not adequately compensate Playa in connection with an actual
or threatened breach by a Sagicor Party (or any of its Affiliates, agents or
representatives) of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_. Accordingly,
the Sagicor Parties hereby expressly waive all rights to raise the adequacy of
Playas remedies at law as a defense if Playa seeks to enforce by injunction
or other equitable relief the due and proper performance and observance of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_. In addition, Playa shall be entitled
to pursue any other available remedies at law or equity, including the
recovery of money damages, or as otherwise specified in this Agreement in
respect of the actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.10_.

that, in the reasonable discretion of Playa, could have an impact (other than

Assets, marketability of title to the Assets, the rights to maintain
existing structures on the Real Property or otherwise used in connection with
the Business in the condition as they currently exist, utilities provided to

(b) Prior to Closing, the Sagicor Parties shall complete any construction work
necessary in order to deliver the Sentry Parcel to Playa at Closing in a
completed and operational state, to the satisfaction of Playa in Playas sole
discretion and at Sagicor Parties sole cost and expense. In the event such
construction work is not completed prior to Closing, Playa shall be
entitled to a credit against the Exchange Consideration in an amount equal to
the anticipated cost in order to complete such items, as such anticipated cost
is to be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_. Playa may propose such anticipated cost to the
Sagicor Parties (the " _Proposed Cost to Complete_ "). Upon receipt of Playas
Proposed Cost to Complete, the Sagicor Parties shall have five (5) business
days from the date of receipt thereof to propose an alternative cost to
complete such construction work by written notice to Playa, together with
reasonable supporting documentation and explanation therefor. If no response
is received from the Sagicor Parties within such five (5) business day
period, the Proposed Cost to Complete shall be deemed agreed to by the Sagicor
Parties and Playa, and such amount shall be credited against the Exchange
Consideration at Closing. If the Sagicor Parties propose changes to the
Proposed Cost to Complete, the parties shall work together in good faith to
agree upon the anticipated cost to complete any such items related to the
Sentry Parcel within five (5) business days of such written notice. If the
Sagicor Parties and Playa are unable to resolve their disagreements with
respect to the anticipated cost to complete such construction work described
herein within five (5) business days after Playas receipt of such written
notice from the Sagicor Parties, then Playa may request that an expert (acting
as expert and not as arbitrators) resolve such dispute (the " _Expert
Determination_ "). The Expert Determination shall be binding on both parties
and shall constitute the agreed upon credit to the Exchange Consideration
afforded to Playa in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
5.15(b)_. Any costs related to the engagement of the expert in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_ shall be borne equally by the
Sagicor Parties and Playa.

 



47 (c) Prior to Closing, the Sagicor Parties shall remedy the violations relating
to the Assets which are initially more particularly described on _Schedule_
__ _ 5.15(c)_ and as such schedule may be supplemented from time to time by
Playa, to the satisfaction of Playa in Playas sole discretion and at Sagicor
Parties sole cost and expense. In the event such violations are not remedied
within thirty (30) days following Closing, Playa shall control the process to
remedy all such violations and engage counsel and any consultants required to
resolve all such violations, provided, the Sagicor Parties shall pay all
costs and expenses related thereto. The obligations of the Sagicor Parties in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_ shall survive Closing.

 

(d) Separation of the Sentry Parcel.

 

(1) Prior to Closing, the Sagicor Parties shall use best efforts to cause, by
way of subdivision and/or transfer (to the extent not transferred at Closign)
or otherwise, the portion of Strata 2446 delineated in yellow on the plan
attached hereto as _Schedule 5.15(d)(1)_ , (collectively, the "Sentry Parcel")
to be legally separated from the remainder of land in Strata 2446 in a manner
and subject to terms and conditions acceptable to Playa in Playas sole
discretion, as well as take any reasonable action requested by Playa in order
to effectuate such separation. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Sagicor
Parties may not decline to take any reasonable action requested by Playa to
achieve the separation of the Sentry Tower as described herein, provided that
the cost incurred by the Sagicor Parties shall not exceed the limitations
described in the last sentence of this paragraph. In connection therewith,
the Sagicor Parties shall vote all their interests in the strata as
Proprietors (as defined in the governing documents of Strata 2446) and cause
any member of any committee appointed by Sagicor Parties and use best efforts
to cause all other Proprietors and members of any committee appointed or
elected by such Proprietors to effectuate the foregoing (which shall also
include any additional matters affecting the Sentry Parcel submitted to the
Executive Committee of Strata 2446 or sub-committee thereof) and diligently
follow up with any recalcitrant Proprietor to get their consent therefor in
accordance with the overall plan for the legal separation of the Sentry
Parcel as agreed to by the parties following the execution hereof and in
accordance with Paragraph 6 below. In connection with the foregoing
obligations, including the obligation to take any action requested by
Playa, the Sagicor Parties shall be solely responsible for any costs and
expenses related thereto up to an amount equal to $1,000,000.00, and any
amounts expended in excess of $1,000,000.00 but less than $5,000,000.00 shall
be borne equally by Playa and the Sagicor Parties. For the avoidance of any
doubt, other than such funds described in the immediately preceding sentence,
the Sagicor Parties shall not be obligated to expend any additional sums in
connection with the aforementioned obligations. 

(2) Prior to Closing and prior to the final legal separation of the Sentry
Parcel from the remaining portion of Strata 2446 as provided above, the
Sagicor Parties shall use their best efforts to procure the amendment of the
by-laws of Strata 2446 and any other governing documents of Strata 2446, and
any documentation used in 

 



48  connection with the sale or transfer of any portion of Strata 2446, to allow
for the operational separation of the Sentry Parcel from the remaining portion
of Strata 2446 in such manner that would allow Playa to operate the Sentry
Parcel as an all-inclusive hotel to the exclusion of all other Proprietors,
and in connection therewith, the separation, and amendments to the governing
documents of Strata 2446, shall include, without limitation, provisions for
separate budgets, assessments, approvals over alterations, capital expenditure
programs, and all other rights and obligations of the Proprietors in Strata
2446 having the practical effect of the Sentry Parcel being operated, managed
and used as a separate stand-alone parcel of land and not part of Strara 2446.

 

(3) In the event any such amendment is unable to be entered into prior to
Closing, the Sagicor Parties and Playa shall cooperate in a manner such that
the actions of the parties and the operation of Strata 2446 have the practical
effect of operating the Sentry Parcel as a separate parcel of land from the
remainder of Strata 2446. In relation thereto, the parties shall reconcile
the payments made with respect to assessments in a manner such that Playa will
be solely responsible for the costs incurred in connection with repairs,
maintenance and capital expenditures on the Sentry Parcel, and the
Sagicor Parties, together with any of Proprietors, shall be solely
responsible for costs incurred in connection with repairs, maintenance and
capital expenditures on the remaining portions of Strata 2446. With respect to
any components which are shared by the Sentry Parcel and the remainder of
Strata 2446, any costs incurred in connection with any repairs, maintenance or
capital expenditures shall be apportioned between Playa and the rest of the
Proprietors (including the Sagicor Parties) in proportion to their unit
entitlements in Strata 2446.

(4) The Sagicor Parties shall use best efforts to appoint Playa or its
Affiliate as the hotel manager for Strata 2446, and as the property manager
for Strata 2446, responsible for the budgeting, operating, expenses, and
overall maintenance of all of the common areas of Strata 2446, and
improvements thereon, on terms agreed to by the parties to the extent not
covered by the Jewel Grande Management Agreement and which are not
inconsistent with the by-laws of the strata corporation as amended from time
to time, including, as amended pursuant to paragraph 2 above.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the foregoing, and in addition to
the obligations described herein, the Sagicor Parties agree that at all times
it will maintain and hold a sufficient percentage of the voting rights needed
when acting in concert with Playa to control Strata 2446 and effectuate the
foregoing, and the Sagicor Parties agree that it will not dispose of units in
Strata 2446to the extent that any such disposition of units causes the Sagicor
Parties and Playa acting jointly to no longer own units, together with any
units owned by Playa, sufficient to maintain a sufficient percentage of the
voting rights needed to control Strata 2446 and effectuate the foregoing.

(6) Following the execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, the
Sagicor Parties and Playa shall use good faith efforts to negotiate and enter
into a detailed plan related to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.15(d)._

 



49 (7) The obligations of the Sagicor Parties in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15(d)_
shall survive Closing.

SECTION 5.16 _Financing Cooperation_. Each of the Sagicor Parties agree to
provide all reasonable cooperation in connection with any debt, equity or
other offering or source of financing by Playa and any of its subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Playa (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Sagicor Parties and the Sagicor Parties do not incur any out-of-pocket
costs) including, (a) participation in meetings with underwriters, upon
reasonable prior notice by Playa, (b) furnishing Playa with pertinent
information reasonably available to the Sagicor Parties regarding the Assets

in connection with any such other debt, equity or other offering or source of
financing by Playa to the extent such documents described in this clause (d)
contain disclosure reflecting or referring to the Sagicor Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sagicor Parties shall not be required to
take any action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ that would reasonably
be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
organizational documents of any of each of the Sagicor Parties or any
applicable Laws. The Sagicor Parties are to be reimbursed by Playa for any
actual reasonable out of pocket costs incurred as a result of the obligations
in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_.

SECTION 5.17 _Transfer_ _of Marks_. The Sagicor Parties shall cause Sagicor

preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit or
refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be
prorated based upon the method employed in this clause (b) taking into
account the type of Tax to which the refund relates. In the case of any Tax
based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or

Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense
at its own expense; _provided_ , however, that if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of

 



56  interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party

determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If

the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in Indemnifying Partys

Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

 

SECTION 8.04 _Effect_ _of Investigation or Closing on Representation and
Warranties_. Neither the investigation nor inspection by Playa or its

__ _ 3.01_, _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.04_ , _3.05_ , _3.06(a)_ , _3.07_ , _3.08_ ,
_3.09_ , _3.10_ , _3.12_ , _3.13_ , _3.21_ , _3.34_ , and _3.36_ shall survive
Closing for an indefinite period of time, and the Sagicor Parties shall
indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses resulting from a
breach thereof. The Sagicor Parties shall be liable for any Claim resulting
from (i) a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_ and _3.06(c)_ hereof if such Claim is asserted within
three (3) years from the Closing Date, (ii) a breach of the representations
and warranties in  _Section_ __ _ 3.07(a)_ and _3.07(b)_ for so long as any
shareholder, booking agent, underwriter or the Securities and Exchange
Commission may bring a claim in connection therewith under any applicable law,
including United States securities laws, United States federal law, Jamaican
law, Dutch law, or any other applicable law, and (iii) a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.34_ and _3.36_
hereof if such Claim is asserted within ten (10) years from the Closing Date.

(b) _Threshold for Claims_. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
any Claim unless the aggregate amount of the expected liability for all Claims
exceeds $75,000 (in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
claim the whole amount of such Losses and not merely the excess above
$75,000).

 



57 (c) _Cap on Losses_. The aggregate amount of the liability of the Indemnifying
Party for all Claims shall not exceed Three Hundred Twenty Five Million and
NO/100 US Dollars ($325,000,000.00).

(d) _Insured Claims_. The Indemnifying Partys liability in respect of any
Claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to any loss or damage to which the
Claim related which has actually been recovered under a policy of insurance
(after deducting any costs incurred in making such recovery including the
amount of any excess or deductible and any Tax incurred as a result of the
receipt of such recovery and taking into account any increased premium);
provided, however, the Indemnified Party shall not be required to first make
a Claim under a policy of insurance prior to making such Claim against the
Indemnifying Party.

(e) _Double Recovery_. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make more
than one Claim arising out of the same subject matter, fact, event or
circumstance, but shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one
liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage or deficiency regardless of whether
more than one Claim arises in respect of it, provided, however, the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to assert a Claim against a
third party prior to making such Claim against the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 8.06 _Tax_ _Treatment_. For Tax purposes, the parties shall report
and treat any indemnity payments made under any provision of this Agreement as
an adjustment to the Exchange Consideration. To the extent any amounts payable
hereunder shall fail to qualify as an adjustment of the
Exchange Consideration, such sums shall be paid free and clear of all
deductions or withholds (including any Taxes and governmental charges of any
nature) unless the deduction or withholding is required by law, in which
event, or in the event that the Indemnified Party shall or will incur any
liability for Tax in respect of any such payment, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay such additional amounts as shall be required to cause the net amount
received by such Indemnified Party to equal the full amount which would
otherwise have been received by it had no such deduction or withholding been
made or no such liability for Taxes been incurred. If the Indemnified Party at
a later time receives a credit for the Taxes previously deducted or withheld,
the amount of any such credit shall be paid to the Indemnifying Party unless
prohibited by applicable law or would result in any adverse Tax consequences
to the Indemnified Party.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _DEFAULT_

 

SECTION 9.01 _Sagicor Parties Default_. In the event that the Sagicor Parties
default in their obligations hereunder and such default is not cured within
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a default notice from Playa (provided
that, there shall be no notice or cure period for the failure to consummate
the Closing as and when required hereunder), Playas sole and exclusive
remedy shall be to either (i) bring an action for specific performance of
Sagicor Parties obligations to close under this Agreement; or (ii) terminate
this Agreement by written notice of termination given to Sagicor, in which
event the Sagicor Parties shall reimburse Playa for the actual out of pocket
cost and expenses incurred by Playa in connection with the

 



58  negotiation and documentation of this Agreement, Playas due diligence and
Playas preparations to close the transaction contemplated hereby, up to and
including the amount of $2,000,000.00, and neither Party shall thereafter
have any liability hereunder to the other Party (except as expressly stated
otherwise in this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, neither the grant of
specific performance nor the foregoing $2,000,000.00 limit on the Sagicor
Parties reimbursement of Playas costs and expenses shall not apply to any
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Playa in
enforcing its right to collect such reimbursement from the Sagicor Parties.
In the event that any circumstances existing at the time of the default by the
Sagicor Parties, in Playas sole discretion, makes it impractical or
impossible for Playa to pursue specific performance of the Sagicor Parties
obligations under this Agreement, Playa shall be entitled to pursue the
Sagicor Parties for any and all remedies available under applicable law or
principles of equity.

 

SECTION 9.02 _Playa Default_. In the event that Playa fails to consummate the
Closing of the transaction as and when required hereunder, the Sagicor
Parties sole and exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement by
written notice of termination given to Playa, (i) in which event Playa shall
reimburse the Sagicor Parties for the actual out of pocket cost and expenses
incurred by the Sagicor Parties in connection with the negotiation and
documentation of this Agreement and the Sagicor Parties preparations to close
the transaction contemplated hereby, up to and including the amount of
$500,000, and (ii) neither party shall thereafter have any liability
hereunder to the other party (except as expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing $500,000 limit on Plays
reimbursement of the Sagicor Parties costs and expenses shall not apply to
any costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the
Sagicor Parties in enforcing its right to collect such reimbursement from
Playa.

 

SECTION 9.03 _Remedies Exclusive_. By the express agreement of Playa and the
Sagicor Parties, the remedies set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ IX_
constitute the sole remedies at law or in equity available to parties on
account of the other partys breach of its obligations to close under this
Agreement, provided, however, to the extent any terms or provisions of this
Agreement are expressly stated to survive the Closing and transfer of title to
the Assets or the termination of this Agreement, Playa and the Sagicor Parties
shall each have all remedies with respect thereto as may be available at law
or in equity. In no event, however, shall either Party be liable for any
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages.

 

ARTICLE X

 

 _CASUALTY_

 

SECTION 10.01 _Material_ _Casualty_. If the Assets or any portion thereof is
damaged or destroyed by fire or any other casualty prior to Closing (a "
_Casualty_ "), Sagicor Parties shall give written notice of such Casualty to
Playa promptly after the occurrence of such Casualty. If the amount of the
repair, restoration or replacement required by a Casualty equals or exceeds
Seven Million and NO/100 United States Dollars (US$7,000,000.00) as determined
by Playa in its reasonable discretion (a " _Material Casualty_ "), then Playa
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) terminate this Agreement
in which event neither party shall thereafter have any liability hereunder to
the other party (except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement), or

 



59  (ii) proceed to Closing, without terminating this Agreement, in which case
Sagicor Parties shall (A) credit the amount of the applicable insurance
deductible against the Exchange Consideration, and (B) transfer and assign to
Playa all of Sagicor Parties right, title and interest in and to all proceeds
from all casualty policies (including, lost profits insurance for the period
from and after Closing) maintained by Sagicor Parties with respect to the
Assets affected by such Casualty; provided, however, that until such time as
Playa receives written confirmation from the applicable insurer, reasonably
satisfactory to Playa, acknowledging the assignment of such claim and
agreeing to acknowledge Playa as the insured under such policies for purposes
of such claim, Sagicor Parties shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue the insurance proceeds thereunder on behalf of Playa. Playa
shall make an election under this _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ by giving written
notice to Sagicor Parties on or before twenty (20) days after Sagicor Parties
delivery to Playa of written notice of such Casualty. If Playa fails to make
an election under this _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ within such twenty (20) day time
period, Playa shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to
Closing pursuant to clause (i) of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_. If the
Closing Date is scheduled to occur within Playas twenty (20) day election
period, the Closing Date shall be extended until the tenth (10th) day after
the expiration of such twenty (20) day election period.

SECTION 10.02 _Non-Material Casualty_. In the event of any Casualty which is
not a Material Casualty and with respect to which at least eighty-five percent
(85%) of the amount of the repair, restoration or replacement required by such
Casualty is covered by Sagicor Parties insurance policies, as determined by
Playa in its reasonable discretion, then Playa shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement, but shall proceed to Closing, in which case Sagicor
Parties shall (A) credit the amount of the applicable insurance
deductible against the Exchange Consideration, and (B) transfer and assign to
Playa all of Sagicor Parties right, title and interest in and to all proceeds
from all casualty policies (including, lost profits insurance for the period
from and after Closing) maintained by Sagicor Parties with respect to the
Assets; provided, however, that until such time as Playa receives written
confirmation from the applicable insurer, reasonably satisfactory to Playa,
acknowledging the assignment of such claim and agreeing to acknowledge Playa
as the insured under such policies for purposes of such claim, Sagicor Parties
shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts, but at no material cost
to Sagicor Parties, to pursue the insurance proceeds thereunder on behalf of
Playa. In the event of any Casualty which is not a Material Casualty and with
respect to which less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the amount of the
repair, restoration or replacement required by such Casualty is covered by
Sagicor Parties insurance policies, as determined by Playa in its reasonable
discretion, then the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ above shall apply as
if such Casualty were a Material Casualty.

 

SECTION 10.03 _Termination_ _due to Casualty_. In the event that Playa is
entitled to terminate this Agreement due to a Casualty, as described in
_Sections_ __ _ 10.01_ and _10.02_ , and such Casualty does not affect all
parcels of Real Property to be acquired by Playa hereunder through Sagicor
Newco, Playa may elect to proceed to closing on the parcels of Real Property
which remain unaffected by the Casualty with a reduction of the consideration
of $325,000,000.00 equal to the portions of the consideration allocated to
such affected parcels of Real Property, as such allocations are to
be determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.11_.

 



60 ARTICLE XI

 

 _CONDEMNATION_

 

SECTION 11.01 _Material_ _Condemnation_. In the event of any actual or
threatened condemnation or taking pursuant to the power of eminent domain of
all or any portion of the Assets, or any proposed sale in lieu thereof (a "
_Condemnation_ "), Sagicor Parties shall give written notice of such
Condemnation to Playa promptly upon Sagicor Parties receipt of notice of
such Condemnation. If the Condemnation would (i) result in any material
reduction or restriction in access to the Assets or the Improvements, or (ii)
have a materially adverse effect on the operation of the Assets or
Improvements as determined by Playa in its reasonable discretion (a "
_Material Condemnation_ "), then Playa shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to (A) terminate this Agreement, in which case neither party shall
thereafter have any liability hereunder to the other party (except as
expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement), or (B) proceed to Closing,
without terminating this Agreement, in which case Sagicor Parties shall assign
to Playa all of Sagicor Parties right, title and interest in all proceeds
and awards from such Condemnation. Playa shall make an election under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.01_ by giving written notice to the Sagicor Parties within
twenty (20) days after Sagicor Parties delivery to Playa of written notice
of such Condemnation. If Playa fails to make an election under this _Section_
__ _ 11.01_ within such time period, Playa shall be conclusively deemed to
have elected to proceed to Closing pursuant to clause (A) of this _Section_
__ _ 11.01_. If the Closing Date is scheduled to occur within Playas twenty
(20) day election period, the Closing Date shall be extended until the tenth
(10th) day after the expiration of such twenty (20) day election period.

SECTION 11.02  _Non-Material Condemnation_. In the event of any Condemnation
of any Assets other than a Material Condemnation, Playa shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement, but shall proceed to Closing, in which
case Sagicor Parties shall assign to Playa all of Sagicor Parties right,
title and interest in all proceeds and awards from such Condemnation.

 

SECTION 11.03 _Termination_ _due to Condemnation_. In the event that Playa is
entitled to terminate this Agreement due to a Condemnation, as described in
_Sections_ __ _ 11.01_ and _11.02_ , and such Condemnation does not affect
all parcels of Real Property to be purchased by Playa hereunder, Playa may
elect to proceed to closing on the parcels of Real Property which remain
unaffected by the Condemnation with a reduction of the consideration of
US$325,000,000.00 equal to the portions of the consideration allocated to such
affected parcels of Real Property, as such allocations are to be determined
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.11_.

therein, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred, except that in

Agreement, the party that prevails in any such Action shall be entitled to be
reimbursed by the other party for all of its costs and expenses, including,
attorneys fees, incurred in connection with such Action. For the avoidance of

SECTION 12.03 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Sagicor Parties nor Playa

such press release or public announcement shall be approved by Playa and
Sagicor Parties prior to any such press release or public announcement being
disseminated to the public.

SECTION 12.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so

63 SECTION 12.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Playa may assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, now or
hereinafter existing, or may nominate in writing any of its Affiliates to
carry out the obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion and without the
prior written consent of the Sagicor Parties provided that in the event of any
such assignment or nomination, Playa shall remain liable for the obligation
assumed by it hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, any Affiliate to which
rights and obligations are transferred, or any Affiliate named as nominee

benefit of the parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to assert
any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such
rights.

SECTION 12.09 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (other than the provisions of _Articles_ __ _ VI_ and _VIII_

and condition set forth in this Agreement is intended to be an independent
