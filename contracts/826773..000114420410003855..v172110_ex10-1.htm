ARTICLE III

 

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

 

3.1 Effect on Securities of the Company. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any Person:

 

 

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 3.2 and
3.5, (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock (a "Common
Share"), par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"),
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall thereupon be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive (A) 0.4 (the "Common Stock Exchange Ratio") of a fully-paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00002 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock"), and (B) 0.012 (the "Series A Preferred Stock
Exchange Ratio") of a fully-paid and nonassessable share of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00002 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Series A Preferred Stock"), and (ii) each issued and
outstanding share of preferred stock (a "Preferred Share"), par value $0.01
per share, of the Company ("Company Preferred Stock"), outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 0.02
(the "Series B Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio") of a fully-paid and
nonassessable share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$0.00002 per share, of Parent ("Parent Series B Preferred Stock"). The
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Series A Preferred Stock issued to
each holder of Common Shares and the shares of Parent Series B Preferred
Stock issued to each holder of Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section
3.1(a), are hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Consideration." As a
result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of Common Shares and
each holder of Preferred Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Shares which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.6(c), all to be issued or
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Shares in accordance with Section 3.6(b). The number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Series A Preferred Stock issued to each holder of
Common Shares pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) and the number of shares of
Parent Series B Preferred Stock issued to each holder of Preferred Shares
pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) shall be rounded up to the next whole share
after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, all outstanding Company
2007 Common Stock Purchase Warrants and Company AMBB Warrants shall be
cancelled and Parent shall thereafter issue to each holder thereof that has
executed and delivered an agreement to exchange their warrants a replacement
warrant, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (each, a
"Substitute Warrant"), to purchase Parent Common Stock, with each Substitute
Warrant being exercisable at the same exercise price and for the same number
of shares as under the applicable Company 2007 Common Stock Purchase Warrant
or Company AMBB Warrant.

 

 

(c) Company Options. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares or
Company Stock Options, the Company Stock Options shall cease to represent a
right to acquire Company Common Stock and shall automatically be converted
into an option (each, a "Substitute Option") to purchase Parent Common Stock.
The Substitute Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to vesting and exercisability) as under the Company
Stock Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreement (as amended)
issued thereunder, except that each such Substitute Option shall be
exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire, that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option. Such Substitute Option shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Company Stock Option.

 

 

3.2 Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock Owned by the Company,
Merger Sub or Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held immediately prior to
the Effective Time (i) by the Company as treasury stock or (ii) by any
Subsidiary of the Company, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be cancelled and retired and
cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

 

3.3 Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, shall be converted into and
become one fully-paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time, so that at the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of
all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.4 Indemnity Shares.

 

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Parent
Representative and the Company Representative shall enter into an Escrow
Agreement in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto (the "Escrow Agreement")
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow
Agent 10,980,000 shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable as Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnity Escrow Shares"),
which will be available to satisfy the indemnification obligations set forth
in Section 9.2. The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be held and
distributed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(b) The Escrow Agent will release all or a portion, as applicable, of the
Indemnity Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the provisions
of Section 9.5. On the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent will, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, release any remaining
Indemnity Escrow Shares, except any amount that is subject to a pending
Parent Claim, which amount shall be released pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
and the provisions of Section 9.5.

 

 

(c) From and after the filing of the Charter Amendment, Parent will at all
times reserve and keep available the Company Indemnity Shares out of its
authorized and unissued Parent Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
satisfying the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9.3.

 

 

3.5 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section
262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a), but instead such holder shall
be entitled to the rights provided under Section 262. At the Effective Time,
all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided under Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided
by Section 262, then the rights of such holder under Section 262 shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a). Any amounts payable in
cash with respect to Appraisal Shares shall be payable by the Company out of
its separate funds, and no funds shall be supplied, directly or indirectly,
by Parent for such purpose. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, if
necessary, the Company shall establish an escrow account and immediately
deposit into such account funds sufficient to pay any such amounts.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.6 Exchange of Shares.

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of holders of the
Shares, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent
Series A Preferred Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be
made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series
A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred Stock will be issued), less
the Indemnity Escrow Shares. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
3.6(c). All certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent
Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent (including the amount of cash to pay any dividends or
other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
3.6(c)) are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (i) a
letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to
the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Common
Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Series A Preferred Stock, and the surrender of
Preferred Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Series B Preferred Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements
shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock,
Parent Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred Stock will be
issued) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
3.6(c). Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in the case of Common Shares
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Series A
Preferred Stock, or in the case of Preferred Shares that number of whole
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock (after taking into account all
Shares surrendered by such holder), to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 3.1(a) (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested), less (with respect to the Common Shares
only) the pro rata portion of the Indemnity Escrow Shares attributable to
each such holder of Common Shares, and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 3.6(c), and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered
in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration
thereof that the surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration
in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.6(b), each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts
to be paid pursuant to Section 3.6(c)) upon such surrender. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of the Shares. If any certificate representing any Shares shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of a customary
affidavit by the holder of such Shares as Parent shall reasonably direct
providing for an indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration as
described in this Article III for such Shares.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A
Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred
Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby, until such
Share has been surrendered in accordance with this Article III. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender
of any such Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof,
without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, in the case of Common
Shares that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Series A
Preferred Stock, or in the case of Preferred Shares that number of whole
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock, in exchange therefor pursuant to
this Article III, together with the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred
Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred
Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock.

 

 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock; Closing of Transfer Books. All shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent
Series A Preferred Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
III and any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.6(c) shall be deemed to have
been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares previously represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except as set forth herein. Subject to Section 3.6(e), if, after
the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article III .


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 3.6(c), subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any certificate representing
any Share shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares
of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B
Preferred Stock or any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder
of such certificate representing any Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares of Parent
Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred
Stock, or dividends or other distributions in respect of such certificate
representing any Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
Person for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(g) Adjustments. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A
Preferred Stock and Parent Series B Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to this
Article III shall be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock
or Parent Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable), cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock, Parent
Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Series B Preferred Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof (but prior to the issuances required by this
Article III).

 

 

3.7 Withholding Taxes. The Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable by it under this Agreement,
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Taxing Authority, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any

any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened
that could be brought or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment or termination of employment or failure to employ by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, of any individual, which if adversely determined

to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all Laws
relating to the employment of labor, including all such Laws relating to
wages, hours, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any
similar state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" law

6.7 Internal Controls and Procedures. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent's disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of

disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rule 13a-15 and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report based on such evaluation. Based on Parent's
management's most recently completed evaluation of Parent's internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) except as
set forth on Schedule 6.7, Parent had no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) Parent does not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal control over financial reporting. There are no outstanding
loans or other extensions of credit made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 

 

7.1 Charter Amendment; Conversion of Parent Series A Preferred. From
and after the Closing, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the approval of an amendment and restatement to Parent's Certificate
of Incorporation in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (the
"Charter Amendment"). In connection with this requirement, subject
to applicable Law and Parent obtaining all necessary consents and approvals,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the Parent
Board to resolve to recommend that Parent's stockholders approve the Charter
Amendment and direct that the Charter Amendment be submitted to Parent's
stockholders for approval, (ii) an irrevocable written consent (the
"Parent Stockholder Consent") to be executed and delivered by the
requisite number of Parent's stockholders to approve the Charter Amendment
and (iii) the preparation of an information statement in accordance with
Regulation 14C promulgated under the Exchange Act (the
"Information Statement") and shall (A) file such Information Statement with
the SEC not later than ten Business Days after Parent's receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Consent and (B) mail such Information Statement to the
Parent's stockholders that did not execute and deliver the Parent Stockholder
Consent (along with notice of the Parent Stockholder Consent in accordance
with Section 228 of the DGCL and Parent's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws) not later than five Business Days after Parent's receipt of
confirmation that the SEC has no further comments on the
Information Statement. The Information Statement shall provide that the
Charter Amendment will become effective 20 days after the Information
Statement is mailed to such stockholders, and Parent shall file the Charter
Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the first
Business Day after such 20-day period has expired. Parent agrees that upon
the filing with and acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of the Charter Amendment, the Parent Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically convert to Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
the Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock, and there

7.2 Controlling Stockholders. As of the date hereof, Parent, the Sponsor
Funds and HM Unitek Coinvest, LP (collectively, the

hereto as Exhibit L whereby the Controlling Stockholders have irrevocably
agreed, among other things, to approve the Charter Amendment in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth therein.

 

 

7.3 Special Committee; Certain Negative Covenants. Parent shall cause
a special committee of its board of directors (the "Special Committee") to
be established immediately after the Closing, with the Special Committee
consisting of three members of the Parent Board, comprised of the two current
directors (each, including any duly appointed successor, a
"Continuing Director Designee") of the Parent Board set forth on Exhibit M
under the heading "Continuing Directors" and one Independent Director
(including any duly appointed successor, the "Independent Director
Designee") appointed by a majority-in-interest of the Parent Board. In the
event that (i) a Continuing Director Designee ceases to serve as a member of
the Parent Board or the Special Committee, the resulting vacancy on the
Special Committee shall be filled with a member of the Parent Board to be
chosen by the other Continuing Director Designee, or in the absence thereof
by the Parent Representative, or (ii) the Independent Director Designee
ceases to serve as a member of the Parent Board or the Special Committee, the
resulting vacancy on the Special Committee shall be filled with an
Independent Director to be chosen by a majority-in-interest of the
Parent Board, and the Parent will take all such actions as are necessary to
cause such replacements to be made in accordance with this sentence.
Parent shall not increase or decrease the number of members on the
Special Committee. Parent shall provide appropriate funding, as determined
by the Special Committee, for the payment to any advisors or legal counsel
retained by the Special Committee and for ordinary administrative expenses of
the Special Committee that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out
its duties. From and after the Closing, until such time as the
Special Committee ceases to exist in accordance with the terms of the Charter
Amendment, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not take any of the following
actions without the prior approval of a majority of the members of the
Special Committee:

 

 

 (a) amend or in any way modify the certificate of incorporation of Parent
(other than as set forth in the Charter Amendment), any certificate of
designation, Parent's bylaws or any other agreement of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in a way that would (i) amend or modify the

the Parent Series B Preferred Stock or (ii) amend or modify the provisions
regarding the rights of the Special Committee;

 

 

 (b) issue any additional shares of the Parent Series A Preferred Stock or

or provision of the BMO Loan Documents, except as set forth in the Credit

(d) refinance or otherwise restructure the BMO Loan, except as set forth in
the Credit Support Agreement;

 

 

(e) for so long as the Controlling Stockholders collectively own beneficially
or of record or otherwise have the right to vote or consent with respect to
at least thirty five percent (35%) of the total number of the then-
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (including Parent Preferred Stock
calculated on an as-if-converted basis), enter into, amend, modify or
supplement, or permit any Subsidiary to enter into, amend, modify or
supplement, any agreement, transaction, commitment or arrangement with any

arrangements and benefit programs (including equity incentive plans) as
approved by the Parent Board or the compensation committee of the Parent
Board and except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(f) amend, modify or supplement any provision of, or agree to the buyout of,
the HM Monitoring and Oversight Agreement other than as permitted
therein; or

 

 

(g) make any determination as to the form of payment of any fees or interest
payments owed pursuant to the Credit Support Agreement; provided, that if
any of the Unitek Credit Agreements do not permit the borrowers thereunder to
make dividends to the Obligors (as defined in the Credit Support Agreement)
to pay such fees or interest payments in cash, then such fees and interest
payments shall be paid in shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock;
provided, further, that if the Special Committee has not made a determination
as to such payment before it is due, then such payment shall be paid in
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock.

 

 

Also, the Special Committee shall have the right at any time to cause the
Parent Board to discuss and take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
determine if the BMO Loan could be refinanced on terms more favorable to
Parent and its Subsidiaries (or otherwise repaid or eliminated), and in such
case the Parent Board shall have the obligation to review with Parent's
management and third party advisors any alternative financing options and the
Parent Board shall have the obligation to consider in good faith taking such
action as is reasonably necessary to refinance the BMO Loan on more favorable
terms to Parent and its Subsidiaries than those in place at such time;
provided, however, that such right may only be exercised two times by members
of the Special Committee in the aggregate during any twelve-month period.

 

 

Lastly, the Special Committee shall have the right, power, and authority to
specifically enforce the right to approve certain actions requiring the
consent of the Special Committee or to specifically enforce the rights of
Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Special Committee with respect to any
covenants, in each case as and only to the extent set forth herein and in any
of the agreements included as exhibits to this Agreement in which the Special
Committee is expressly granted third party beneficiary rights.

or other Rights granted on or after the Closing Date pursuant to the Company
Stock Option Plan, and shall cause there to be a Registration Statement filed

Time with respect to all shares of Parent Common Stock into which grants
outstanding prior to the Effective Time under the Company Stock Option Plan

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, repeal or modify any provision in Parent's, the Surviving
Corporation's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other organizational documents) or in
any indemnification agreements, if any, in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, relating to the exculpation or indemnification (or
advancement of expenses provisions with respect thereto) of any officers,
employees, members, managers and directors (unless required by Law), it being
the intent of the parties hereto that the past and present officers,
employees, members, managers and directors of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification (and advancement of expenses provisions with respect thereto)
to the full extent provided in such certificate or articles of incorporation
or bylaws (or other organizational documents) or indemnification agreements.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall

Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, member,
manager, officer or employee of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, manager,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person's
heirs, executors or administrators, a "DandO Indemnified Party") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each DandO Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as
an officer, member, manager, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of Parent or the Company,
as applicable). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the DandO Indemnified Party in the defense of
any such Action.

be maintained in effect (i) the coverage provided by the policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time maintained
by Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time and/or (ii) a "tail" policy
under the Parent's and the Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policy that covers those Persons who are currently covered by
Parent's and the Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior
to the Effective Time, is from a carrier with comparable credit ratings to
Parent's or the Company's, as applicable, existing directors' and officers'
insurance policy carrier and contains terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the insured than those of Parent's or the Company's, as
applicable, directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof; provided, however, that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by Parent or the Company, as applicable, prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for such amount.

 

 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.5.

 

 

(e) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such DandO Indemnified Party may
have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL
(or any other applicable Law) or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 7.5 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

 

 

7.6 Further Assurances; Cooperation. From and after the Closing, the parties
hereto agree to execute and deliver all documents, provide all information
and take such actions as may be requested by another party hereto and as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

 

7.7 Employees and Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Parent and the Company agree to honor, and to cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries to honor, from and
after the Effective Time, all of the Parent Plans in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (other than for benefit accrual
under a defined benefit plan) as well as for purposes of calculating vacation
or severance benefits, if applicable, under the employee benefit plans of
Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries providing benefits to employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Parent Employees") after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Parent Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with Parent and its Affiliates before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Parent Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Parent Plans,
provided that such service will not be credited to the extent it would result
in duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing: (i) each Parent Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Parent Plan in which such Parent Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Parent Employee, Parent and the Company shall cause, or cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries to cause, all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent such requirements would not have applied under the comparable
Parent Plan that employee and his or her covered dependents participated in
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent and the Company shall cause, or cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries to cause,
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the applicable plan year ending on the date
such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. The

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 shall be satisfied solely by
the distribution and/or cancellation of Indemnity Escrow Shares in accordance
with Section 9.5(c) and in no event shall the indemnification obligations
under Section 9.2 exceed the Indemnity Escrow Shares or require any payment

indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2 exceeds $1,000,000 (the

entitled to indemnification for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible
Amount, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 9.4(a)(i), and no
claims shall be made by any Company Indemnified Party for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.3, unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses
in excess of the Deductible Amount, subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 9.4(a)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount
shall not apply to any indemnification obligations relating to Losses (i)

by Parent or Merger Sub, any agent of Parent or Merger Sub or the Parent
Representative with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) by Parent or Merger Sub, any agent of Parent or Merger Sub or
the Parent Representative at any time, whether before or after the execution

will not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted by the
Company, any agent of the Company or the Company Representative with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by the Company,
any agent of the Company or the Company Representative at any time, whether

(g) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article
IX shall be reduced by the amounts actually recovered by the applicable
Indemnified Parties under applicable insurance policies with respect to
claims related to such Losses, net of all costs and expenses associated with
the recovery thereof, including any premium increases, and net of the
Deductible Amount applicable to such Losses.

 

 

(h) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants and
agreements, and calculating Losses hereunder, any and all materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifications (or similar qualifications, but not
specific dollar thresholds) in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be disregarded (other than those set forth in
Sections 5.6(b),
5.18(a), 5.21, 5.23, 6.6(b), 6.6(c), 6.19(a), 6.23, and other than
those included in any references to any "Company Material Contract" or
"Parent Material Contract," which shall not be disregarded for purposes of
determining the failure of any such representations or warranties to be true
and correct).

 

 

9.5 Procedures. The following procedures shall govern any claim
for indemnification made pursuant to Sections 9.2 and 9.3, subject to the
applicable limitations set forth in this Article IX, and shall be

64  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(a) Notice of Losses by Parent Indemnified Parties. Subject to the applicable
limitations set forth in this Article IX, promptly after the discovery by the
Parent Representative of any Loss or Losses that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Parent
Representative shall deliver to the Company Representative written notice (a
"Parent Claim") thereof that specifies in reasonable detail (including
supporting schedules or material) each individual item of Loss included in
the amount so stated, the date (if any) such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or claim
to which each such item is related and, to the extent computable, the
computation of the amount to which such Parent Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder; provided that no delay on the part of the Parent
Representative in notifying the Company Representative shall diminish the
rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to obtain recovery for the Parent
Claim except to the extent that the delay shall increase the amount of such
Loss in the Parent Claim, and then only to such extent. If the Company
Representative objects to the indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party
in respect of any Loss or Losses specified in any Parent Claim, the
Company Representative shall deliver a written notice to such effect to the
Parent Representative within 30 days after receipt by the Company
Representative of such Parent Claim (the "Notice of Disagreement"). During
the 30 days immediately following Parent Representative's receipt of the
Notice of Disagreement, the Company Representative and the Parent
Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such Loss or Losses set forth in
the Parent Claim to which the Company Representative has objected. If the
Parent Representative and the Company Representative agree with respect to
any of the Loss or Losses set forth in the Parent Claim, the Parent
Representative and the Company Representative shall promptly prepare and sign
a memorandum setting forth such agreement and, if applicable, an instruction
to the Escrow Agent. If the Parent Representative and the Company
Representative are unable to resolve their differences with respect to any
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement by the end of such 30-day
period, then the Parent Representative and the Company Representative shall
jointly engage in a confidential mediation (the "Mediation") an independent
mediator (the "Mediator") to resolve all matters that remain in dispute with
respect to the Notice of Disagreement. Such Mediator shall be an attorney
specializing in commercial law who has been licensed to practice law in New
York for 15 years and is selected by the New York, New York office of JAMS,
provided that JAMS agrees upon its engagement to render a decision regarding
the claim within 20 Business Days following the engagement, and if JAMS shall
not so agree, the Mediator shall be an independent third party mutually
agreeable to the Parent Representative and the Company Representative that
shall agree to render a decision within such time period. Each party shall
be entitled to submit a written position paper in support of its position to
the Mediator, and the parties shall thereafter be entitled to present their
positions to the Mediator at a hearing to take place within such 20-Business
Day period. The Mediator shall choose one of the parties' positions based
solely upon the written submissions and hearing. If only one written
submission is made, the Mediator will choose that position and, if no written
submissions are made, the Company Representative's position shall be
conclusive and binding. Parent will pay the fees and expenses of the
Mediation and the expenses, if any, incurred by each party in connection with
the written submissions. All determinations made by the Mediator will be in
writing and will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and such
Loss or Losses shall thereafter be treated as an Agreed Claim for the amount
determined in accordance with this Section 9.5(a) for purposes of
Section 9.5(c).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Notice of Losses by Company Indemnified Parties. Subject to the
applicable limitations set forth in this Article IX, promptly after the
discovery by the Company Representative of any Loss or Losses that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder,
the Company Representative shall deliver to the Parent Representative written
notice (a "Company Claim") thereof that specifies in reasonable detail
(including supporting schedules or documentary material) each individual item
of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date (if any) such item was
paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the
nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant or claim to which each such item is related and, to the extent
computable, the computation of the amount to which such Company Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled hereunder; provided that no delay on the part of
the Company Representative in notifying the Parent Representative shall
diminish the rights of the Company Indemnified Parties to obtain recovery for
the Company Claim except to the extent that the delay shall increase the
amount of such Loss in the Company Claim, and then only to such extent. If
the Parent Representative objects to the indemnification of a Company
Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss or Losses specified in any Company
Claim, the Parent Representative shall deliver a Notice of Disagreement to
the Company Representative within 30 days after receipt by the Parent
Representative of such Company Claim. During the 30 days immediately
following Company Representative's receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, the
Company Representative and the Parent Representative shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such Loss or Losses set forth in the Company Claim to which the Parent
Representative has objected. If the Parent Representative and the Company
Representative agree with respect to any of the Loss or Losses set forth in
the Company Claim, the Parent Representative and the Company Representative
shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement
and, if applicable, an instruction to the Escrow Agent. If the Parent
Representative and the Company Representative are unable to resolve
their differences with respect to any matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement by the end of such 30-day period, then the
Parent Representative and the Company Representative shall jointly engage a
Mediator to resolve all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the
Notice of Disagreement in a confidential Mediation. Such Mediator shall be an
attorney specializing in commercial law who has been licensed to practice law
in New York for 15 years and is selected by the New York, New York office of
JAMS, provided that JAMS agrees upon its engagement to render a decision
regarding the claim within 20 Business Days following the engagement, and if
JAMS shall not so agree, the Mediator shall be an independent third party
mutually agreeable to the Parent Representative and the Company
Representative that shall agree to render a decision within such time period.
Each party shall be entitled to submit a written position paper in support
of its position to the Mediator, and the parties shall thereafter be entitled
to present their positions to the Mediator to take place within such
20-Business Day period. The Mediator shall choose one of the
parties' positions based solely upon the written submissions and hearing. If
only one written submission is made, the Mediator will choose that position,
and, if no submissions are made, the Parent Representative's position shall
be conclusive and binding. Parent will pay the fees and expenses of the
Mediation and the expenses, if any, incurred by each party in connection with
the written submissions. All determinations made by the Mediator will be in
writing and will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and such
Loss or Losses shall thereafter be treated as an Agreed Claim for the
amount determined in accordance with this Section 9.5(b) for purposes of
Section 9.5(c).

 

 

(c) Agreed Claims. Claims for Losses specified in any Parent Claim to which
the Company Representative did not object in writing within 30 days
of receipt of such Parent Claim, Claims for Losses specified in any Company
Claim to which the Parent Representative did not object in writing within 30
days of receipt of such Company Claim, claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 9.5(a) or Section
9.5(b), and claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the
subject of resolution by mediation or of a final non-appealable judicial
determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Agreed Claims."
Within ten Business Days after the determination of an Agreed Claim (i) for
the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties (to the extent all such Agreed
Claims for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate,
exceed the Deductible), Parent, the Parent Representative and the Company
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the
Indemnity Escrow Shares that number of shares of Parent Common Stock having
an aggregate Market Value equal to the amount of such Agreed Claim (and
Parent agrees to then immediately cancel and retire such released Parent
Common Stock) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) for the
benefit of the Company Indemnified Parties (to the extent all such Agreed
Claims for the benefit of the Company Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate,
exceed the Deductible), the Parent Representative and the
Company Representative shall instruct Parent to issue (and Parent shall
issue) to the Former Company Stockholders from the Company Indemnity Shares
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock having an aggregate Market Value
equal to the amount of such Agreed Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no Company Indemnity Shares will be issued after the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Remaining Escrow. All property held as part of the Indemnity
Escrow Shares that is not required to satisfy an Agreed Claim and is not
subject to a pending Parent Claim shall be released to the Former Company
Stockholders not later than the third Business Day after the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all property held as part of
the Indemnity Escrow Shares on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date
shall be released to the Former Company Stockholders in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.
