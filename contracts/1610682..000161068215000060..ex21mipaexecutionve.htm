three Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, Seller shall deliver

its components, together with reasonable supporting documentation. Attached
hereto as Schedule 2.06(a) is an illustrative calculation of the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment as of December 31, 2014 (the "Balance Sheet Date")
as if the Balance Sheet Date were the Closing Date. The existence of any

with reasonable supporting documentation. If Seller disagrees with any of the
calculations provided by Buyer pursuant to the notice referenced in the
foregoing sentence, then it shall provide Buyer with written notice thereof
within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof and shall include
reasonable detail regarding such specific objections. If Buyer and Seller
working in good faith are unable to agree on such disputed items on or prior
to the 90th day following the Closing Date, then either Party may refer such
dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or one of its affiliates or, if that
firm declines to act as provided in this Section 2.06(b), another firm of
independent public accountants or valuation experts, mutually acceptable to
Buyer and Seller, which firm shall make a final and binding determination as
to all matters in dispute on a timely basis and promptly shall notify the
Parties in writing of its resolution. Such accounting firm handling the
dispute resolution shall not have the power to modify or amend any term or
provision of this Agreement and shall not assign a value to any component of
the Working Capital Adjustment greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Buyer or Seller or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either Buyer or Seller. Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear
and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by such accounting firm.
If Seller does not object to Buyer's calculations within the time period and
in the manner set forth in the first sentence of this Section 2.06(b) or
accepts Buyer's calculations, then such calculations as set forth in Buyer's
notice shall become final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes
hereunder.

(c) If the Working Capital Adjustment (as agreed between Buyer and Seller or
as determined by the above-referenced valuation or accounting firm) is a value
that is (i) greater than the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, then Buyer
shall pay to Seller or its designee(s) within five Business Days after such
amounts are so agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller, the amount of such
difference plus interest (at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate as published
on the Closing Date) accrued thereon from the Closing Date through and
including the date of such payment or (ii) less than the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment, then Seller and Buyer shall execute a joint instruction to
the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, within five Business Days after such amounts
are agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Buyer, the amount of such difference plus interest
(at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal
on the Closing Date) accrued thereon from the Closing Date through and
including the date of such payment.

Section 2.07. Third-Party Credits. If, following the Closing Date, any shipper
under any Existing Throughput Agreement elects to utilize an overpayment or
use-or-pay credit that was earned or accrued and not used prior to the date of
this Agreement (the aggregate amount of all such credits, the "Third Party
Credit Amount") to reduce the amount of fees payable by such Shipper to the
Company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, then Seller and Buyer shall
execute a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, within five Business Days after such credit is elected
to be utilized, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer, the amount of such credit. Schedule 2.07 contains a
complete and accurate list of all overpayments and use-or-pay credits that
were earned or accrued by any shipper under any Existing Throughput Agreement

and its Representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice
and during normal business hours, to the Company's Assets and officers and
employees who have significant responsibility for the Company's Assets, but
only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
Business or the safe commercial operations of the Company's Assets; provided,
however, that (A) Seller shall have the right to have a Representative present
for any communication with the Facility Operators and their Representatives
regarding the Company's operation of the Business, (B) Buyer shall and shall
cause its Representatives to observe and comply with all health, safety and
security requirements of the Company, and (C) Buyer shall have the right to
conduct commercially reasonable and appropriately focused Phase II
environmental testing of any and all recognized environmental conditions,
including any historical recognized environmental conditions, controlled
recognized environmental conditions and investigations of any potential
Release identified in a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conducted by
Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any Assets
or Real Property (such Phase I or Phase II reports collectively referred to as
Buyer's "Environmental Assessment"); provided, that Buyer agrees to the
contemporaneous sharing of the results of such Environmental Assessment
(including preliminary lab data and draft reports to the extent available to
Buyer and not previously available to Seller) with Seller; provided, further,
that Buyer shall not conduct any unreasonably intrusive environmental sampling
or testing or unreasonably interfere with the Company's ongoing operations.
Buyer shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject
to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided,
however, that if the Confidentiality Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of
Buyer, then Buyer hereby agrees to be bound by and to comply with the terms
and conditions of such Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall have no right of access to, and none of Seller, the
Company or any of their Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide any
information, the disclosure of which (1) would reasonably be expected in the
opinion of counsel to jeopardize any legal privilege available to Seller, the
Company or any of their Affiliates, (2) would cause Seller, the Company or
their Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation, or (3) would result
in a violation of Law.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, their
Affiliates and any of their respective Representatives for any and all
liabilities, losses, costs or expenses incurred by Seller, the Company, any of
their Affiliates or their respective Representatives arising out of the access
rights under this Section 6.02, including any Claims by any of Buyer's
Representatives for any injuries or property damage while accessing any Assets
purported to be held or used by Seller or the Company, except to the extent
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, the Company or
their respective Representatives.

(c) Buyer may contact customers or potential customers of the Company,
provided that Buyer may only do so with the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent may be withheld by Seller in its sole discretion).

Section 6.03. Regulatory and Other Approvals. From the Effective Date until
Closing (the "Interim Period"):

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents and approvals that are required of it in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that for purposes of clarification,
the obtaining of such consents and approvals shall not be a condition to the
Closing except to the extent expressly set forth in Section 7.05 or Section
8.05, as applicable.

(b) In connection with any required filings or approvals or consents of
Governmental Authorities, Seller and Buyer shall, and Seller shall cause the
Company to, cooperate in good faith with Governmental Authorities and undertake promptly any reasonably necessary
actions required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that neither Party will be required to divest any of its
or its Affiliates' assets in connection with these actions.

(c) Each Party shall provide prompt notification to the other when it becomes
aware that any consent or approval referred to in this Section 6.03 is
obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable.

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:

(i) Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than 10 Business Days after the execution hereof, filings under
the HSR Act. The Persons making such filings shall request early termination
of any applicable HSR Act waiting period, shall promptly furnish each other
with copies of any notices, correspondence or other written communication
received from the relevant Governmental Authority, shall promptly make any
necessary or advisable subsequent or supplemental filings or submissions
required or requested by the relevant Governmental Authority and shall, to the
extent reasonably necessary and appropriate, cooperate with one another in the
preparation of such filings or submissions.

(ii) Buyer and Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, take any action that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the approval of any Governmental Authority of any of the filings referred to
in this Section 6.03.

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear one-half of the cost of all filing
or application fees payable to any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of whether Buyer,
Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates is required to make the
payment.

Section 6.04. Tax Matters.

(a) With respect to any Tax Return that is required to be filed by the Company
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Return. With respect to any Tax
Return that is required to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date with
respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared such
Tax Return. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement or
otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due date
(including extensions) for filing each Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or
for a Straddle Period, the Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return
shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the Other Party for its review and
reasonable comment. The Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall
consider in good faith any such comments received from the Other Party not
less than 15 days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such
Tax Return. Seller shall deliver to Buyer a final copy of each Tax Return that
Seller is obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared pursuant to this
Section 6.04(a) not less than seven days prior to the due date for such Tax
Return, and Buyer shall deliver to Seller a final copy of each Tax Return that
Buyer is obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared pursuant to this Section
6.04(a) promptly after filing. Buyer shall cause each Tax Return that is the
subject of this Section 6.04(a) to be timely filed and shall timely pay the
Taxes shown due thereon; provided that not later than five Business Days prior
to the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to any such Tax Return,
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Seller Taxes owed with respect to such
Tax Return. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provision
herein, all deductions that may be claimed by the Company with respect to the
payment of Transaction Expenses shall be allocated to Pre-Closing Periods (or,
if applicable, to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date), and for the avoidance of doubt all such deductions shall be allocated
by the Company entirely to Seller, in each case, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law. To the extent a liability accrued for Taxes in determining the Net
Working Capital exceeds the amount due and payable with respect to such Taxes,
as determined on the due date for payment of such Taxes, Buyer shall pay to
Seller the amount of such excess on such due date.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax that is
attributable to a Pre‑Closing period or the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the applicable taxable period
ended with (and included) the close of business on the Closing Date; provided
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the Assets of the Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period.

provided, however, that Taxes shall be treated as due for the period during
which the base of such Taxes are determined without regard to whether the
payment of such Taxes provides the right to business or other benefits for
another period, and Taxes attributable to any event occurring on the Closing
Date but after the Closing which is precipitated by the Buyer or its
Affiliates and is not in the ordinary course of business of the Company shall
be attributed to the Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date.

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
Article XI shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party from and against
any and all Losses incurred by such Party in connection with or arising from,
one-half of the amount of any and all sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, transfer
Tax, conveyance, registration or other similar Tax imposed on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) After the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to):

(i) assist the Other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such Other Party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 6.04(a),
and in connection therewith, provide the Other Party with any necessary powers
of attorney;

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company;

(iii) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company; and

(iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to the Company. (e) After the Closing, no amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of the Company
without the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) of Seller.

(f) The parties agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be treated, in part, as the purchase and sale of the Assets of the
Company, and in part, as a contribution of the Assets of the Company to Buyer
qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss under Section 721 of the Code,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and any applicable state or local taxes
that follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment). Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared an allocation
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"), allocating the portion of the Purchase
Price paid in cash (plus any other amounts that are required to be taken into
account as consideration for the purchase and sale of the Assets of the
Company contemplated under this Agreement for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) among the Company's Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyer shall deliver the
Allocation Schedule to Seller as soon as practicable after the Closing Date
for Seller's review and reasonable comments. Within 30 days after receiving
such Allocation Schedule, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing if Seller has
any objections to the allocations on the Allocation Schedule and shall specify
the basis for any such objections. If Seller does not notify Buyer of any
objection to the Allocation Schedule, then it shall be deemed agreed to by
Buyer and Seller and the Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If
Seller objects to any allocations on the Allocation Schedule, then Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding the
Allocation Schedule as soon as practicable (taking into account the due date
of any Tax Returns on which the allocation set forth in the Allocation
Schedule is required to be reflected) and shall memorialize the agreed
allocation in a final Allocation Schedule, which shall be final and binding.
The final Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any Working Capital Adjustment
and any indemnification payments (which shall be treated for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, as
adjustments to the Purchase Price), in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(g) Buyer and Seller shall report and file Tax Returns in all respects
consistent with the Allocation Schedule. None of Buyer, Seller, the Company or
their respective Affiliates shall take any position for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable Law. If any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation set forth in
the Allocation Schedule, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the Other Party of such dispute and the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order to preserve the
effectiveness of the allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.05, the following
shall apply to any Tax Claim for which Seller could have liability pursuant to
this Agreement (an "Indemnified Tax Claim"): Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates, of notice of any pending or threatened Indemnified Tax Claim;
provided, however, that the failure to so notify shall not relieve Seller of
any liability hereunder except to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced
thereby. Seller shall have the right to represent the Company's interests in
any such Indemnified Tax Claim, and Seller shall have the right to employ
counsel of its choice, and to control the defense of such Indemnified Tax
Claim at Seller's cost; provided, however, that Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed of the progress of any such audit or other proceeding and
shall not settle any such Indemnified Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and Seller agree to
report each indemnification payment made in respect of a Loss as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state or local taxes
that follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment).

Section 6.05. Public Announcements. The Parties will maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and its terms except that any Party may
disclose this Agreement or any of its terms (a) to any of the following if the
recipient of such information is advised of the confidentiality obligations
relating to such information: (1) any direct and indirect holders of Equity
Interests in such Party or any Affiliate of such Party and (2) any potential
lender to such Party, and (b) if, in the reasonable opinion of the Party
making such disclosure after receiving advice from such Party's legal counsel,
such disclosure is required by Law, any listing agreement with any securities
exchange or any securities exchange regulation. The Parties will consult with
each other prior to issuing any publication or press release of any nature
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not make or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any such publication
or press release prior to such consultation and without the prior written
consent of the Other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) except to the extent, but only to such extent, that, in the opinion
of the Party issuing such publication or press release, such announcement or
statement may be required by Law, any listing agreement with any securities
exchange or any securities exchange regulation, in which case the Party
proposing to issue such publication or press release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the Other Party
before issuing any such publication or press release and shall reasonably
cooperate with the Other Party in good faith with respect to the timing,
manner and content of disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the other
provisions of this Section 6.05), to the extent required by applicable Law,
USDP shall be permitted to describe the material terms of this Agreement in,
and file this Agreement as an exhibit to, any report required to be filed with
the SEC pursuant to applicable federal securities laws.

Section 6.06. Confidentiality.

(a) Each of the Parties agrees hereby to be bound by and to comply with the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement from and after the
Closing as if such Party and such Other Party were each party to the
Confidentiality Agreement and, regardless of any termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to its terms upon or following the
Effective Date, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (in the event that
the Confidentiality Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms, as if the
Confidentiality Agreement were still in full force and effect), information
provided to or received from, as applicable, the Other Party pursuant to this
Agreement as if such information constituted Confidential Information pursuant
to such Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that if the
Confidentiality Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of a Party, then such
Party hereby agrees to be bound by and to comply with the terms and conditions
of such Confidentiality Agreement applicable to such Affiliate and such Party
shall be a beneficiary of the rights under such Confidentiality Agreement that
are for the benefit of such Affiliate; provided, further, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent required by applicable Law, USDP shall be
permitted to describe the material terms of this Agreement in, and file this
Agreement as an exhibit to, any report required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to applicable federal securities laws.

(b) From and after the Closing for a period of two years, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Company, except to the extent that Seller can show that such information (i)
is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
or (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing from sources which are
not known to Seller to be prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its Affiliates
or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any confidential
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only
that portion of such information which Seller is advised by its counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information.

Section 6.07. DandO Coverage. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase,
at Seller's expense, a "tail" policy of directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy on the same terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and amount, for such individuals for six years after
the Closing.

Section 6.08. Termination of Agreements with Seller and Non-Company
Affiliates; Insurance. Prior to the Closing, the Company will cause all
Related Party Contracts to terminate, other than directors' and officers'
indemnity obligations and any reimbursements or current pay. Buyer
acknowledges that all Policies shall have been terminated at the Closing and
that, following the Closing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for procuring
insurance for the Business and for paying all premiums thereunder. If Buyer,
the Company or any of their Affiliates receive any refunds for premiums paid
prior to the Closing Date pursuant to any of the Policies which amounts
thereof have not previously been credited to Seller pursuant to Section 2.06,
then Buyer shall pay to Seller all such amounts within five Business Days
following the receipt of such amounts.

Section 6.09. Escrow.

(a) The Parties agree that they will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Escrow Agent to return at the Closing a duly
executed counterpart executed by Escrow Agent of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Buyer is entitled to all or a portion of the Escrowed Cash to the extent
required to fulfill any obligations of Seller under Section 2.06(c), Section
2.07 or Section 11.02 and shall be treated as the owner of any amounts held by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement except to the extent such
amounts are actually distributed to Seller. To the extent funds are due to
Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
such funds to Buyer. In the event there is a dispute regarding the amount of
funds to be released from the Escrow Account, only that portion of the funds
in dispute shall be held back and not released until resolution of the
dispute. If any Escrowed Cash (or interest thereon) remains in the Escrow
Account on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties shall
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions promptly to
deliver all amounts against which there is no indemnity Claim of Buyer then
still unresolved by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller in
accordance with the directions of Seller; provided that, if any Third Party
Credit Amount remains outstanding as of such 18-month anniversary date, then
the aggregate amount of such Third Party Credit Amount shall be retained in
the Escrow Account until the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date and, if
not used as of such 24-month anniversary date, shall be released to Seller
upon such 24-month anniversary date. Section 6.10. Exclusive Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Exclusivity Agreement and subject to the following sentence in this
Section 6.10, Buyer and Seller agree that the Exclusivity Agreement shall
terminate upon the date hereof. Until this Agreement is terminated, each of
Buyer and Seller agrees to be bound by the provisions contained in the second
paragraph of the Exclusivity Agreement (as if the Exclusivity Agreement were
still in full force and effect) and Seller agrees to instruct the Seller
Members party thereto to execute documentation pursuant to which each such
Seller Member agrees to be bound by such provisions.

Section 6.11. Further Assurances.Section 6.11. Further Assurances. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time
after the Closing, at any Party's request and without further consideration,
the Other Party shall (and in the case of Buyer, Buyer shall and shall cause
the Company, as applicable, to) execute and deliver to such Party such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as such
Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.12. Audits and Filings.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall direct its Affiliates, partners, members, shareholders,
owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and Representatives
to, cooperate reasonably with Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective
agents and Representatives in connection with compliance with Buyer's and its
Affiliates' Tax, financial or other reporting requirements and audits,
including (i) any filings with any Governmental Authority and (ii) any filings
that may be required by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), under securities laws applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates,
including the filing by Buyer or its Affiliates with the SEC of one or more
registration statements to register any securities of Buyer or its Affiliates
under the Securities Act or of any report required to be filed by Buyer or its
Affiliates under the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Filings"). Further, from
and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall direct its Affiliates to, make available to Buyer and its Affiliates
and their agents and Representatives any and all books, records, information
and documents that are attributable to the Assets in Seller's or such
Affiliates' possession or control reasonably required by Buyer, its Affiliates
and their agents and Representatives in order to prepare for Buyer or its
Affiliates, if required, in connection with such Filings, financial statements
relating to the Assets or to the Seller or its Affiliates meeting the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, along with any
documentation attributable to the Assets or otherwise relating to Seller or
its Affiliates required to complete any audit associated with such financial
statements.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.12(a), from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
direct its Affiliates to, cooperate with the independent auditors chosen by
Buyer ("Buyer's Auditor") in connection with any audit by Buyer's Auditor of
any financial statements of the Assets or of Seller or its Affiliates that
Buyer or any of its Affiliates requires to comply with the requirements of
federal securities laws or other Tax, financial or reporting requirements.
Such cooperation will include (i) reasonable access to Seller's officers,
managers, employees, agents and Representatives who were responsible for
preparing or maintaining the financial records and work papers and other
supporting documents used in the preparation of such financial statements as
may be required by Buyer's Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify
such financial statements, (ii) delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from Seller to Buyer's Auditor that are reasonably
requested by Buyer to allow such auditors to complete an audit (or review of
any financial statements), and to issue an opinion acceptable to Buyer's Auditor with respect to an audit or review of those financial records
required pursuant to this Section 6.12(b) and (iii) using reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of the independent auditor(s) of Seller that conducted
any audit of such financial statements to be named as an expert in any report
filed by Buyer with the SEC. Buyer will reimburse Seller, within ten Business
Days after demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in complying with the provisions of this
Section 6.12(a) and/or (b).

(c) For a period of 18 months following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, retain all books, records, information and documents
in its or its Affiliates' possession that are necessary to prepare and audit
financial statements with respect to the Assets or otherwise relating to
Seller or its Affiliates, except to the extent originals or copies thereof are
transferred to Buyer in connection with Closing.

Section 6.13. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) Non-Competition. From the Closing Date until the third anniversary
thereof, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate,
control, consult, become employed by or participate in any manner in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, or consulting to, any
business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in any aspect of a Competitive Business within the
Restricted Territory, except that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
restricted from acquiring, directly or indirectly, less than 1% of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a
Competitive Business.

(b) Non-Interference with Customers and Suppliers. From the Closing Date until
the third anniversary thereof, Seller shall not cause, induce or encourage,
any actual or prospective customer, supplier or licensor of the Company or CCR
Pipeline or any other Commercial Counterparty to terminate or modify any such
relationship, in each case, within or with respect to the Restricted
Territory.

(c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. From the Closing Date until the third
anniversary thereof, Seller shall not cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
employee, if any, of the Company or CCR Pipeline to leave such employment or
hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 6.13(c) shall restrict (i) any general advertisement
or solicitation that is not directed at employees of the Company or CCR
Pipeline, or (ii) the employment of any person who responds to any such
general advertisement or solicitation or who contacts Seller or one of its
Affiliates on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect
solicitation in contravention of the above restrictions.

(d) Non-Disparagement. For a period from the date hereof until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, each of the Parties will not, and will direct
its respective Affiliates not to, make any statement with respect any of the
other Parties or their respective businesses, products or services, either in
writing or orally, to any Person other than a Party (including employees or
former employees of Buyer, the Company, CCR Pipeline or their respective
Affiliates or any Person described in Section 6.13(b)) that disparages,
discredits, degrades or lowers the reputation of such Party or its respective
businesses, products or services, including the publication of articles or
press releases and interviews with individuals or institutions engaged in the
business of communication, publishing or broadcasting news, opinion or other
information, either on the record, off the record, or "on background" unless
provided with advance written authorization from such Party to do so, or
encourage or participate with any Person to make such statements.

(e) Certain Acknowledgements. Each of the Parties acknowledges, in connection
with the covenants and agreements in this Section 6.13, that (i) such
covenants and agreements impose a reasonable restraint in light of the
activities and business and current plans with respect thereto of Buyer and
Seller, (ii) it is the intention of the Parties that the entire goodwill of
the business of the Company be transferred to Buyer as part of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the goodwill
existing between the Company's business, on the one hand, and its clients,
customers, suppliers, agents, employees, contractors, consultants, and other
Persons under contract or otherwise associated or doing business with them, on
the other hand, and (iii) such covenants and agreements are supported by
adequate consideration.

(f) Injunctive Relief. The covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 6.13 relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 6.13 may cause
irreparable injury to Buyer, Seller or the Company, the amount of which may be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this Section
6.13 may be inadequate. Therefore, Buyer, Seller and the Company will each be
entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this
Section 6.13 without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any
bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 6.13 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer and
the Company may have hereunder or at law or in equity. If Buyer or the Company
were to seek damages for any breach of this Section 6.13, the portion of the
Base Purchase Price which is allocated by the Parties to the foregoing
covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit on such damages. If it
shall be judicially determined that Seller has violated this Section 6.13,
then the applicable period described in this Section 6.13 will automatically
be extended by a period of time equal in length to the period during which
such violation or violations occurred.

(g) Reformation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Parties agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final
nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant
feature of this Section 6.13 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public
policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or
other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not
arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable
Party. If any Law or court interpreting such Law does not allow such lesser
time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
to be enforced against the applicable Party, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Section 12.11 will apply.

Section 6.14. Employee Matters.

(a) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer, one of its Affiliates or its third
party services provider intends to offer employment to and to hire, effective
as of the Closing (or at such other time as may be determined by the Buyer
(but not earlier than the Closing Date)), employees of the Facility Operators
or their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Employers") who provide
services with respect to the Business (the "Business Employees") and who are
identified on Schedule 6.14 and any employees who may be hired by the
Employers following the Closing to replace any such listed employees. Any such
offer of employment that may be provided to a Business Employee is referred to
herein as an "Offer" and any Business Employee who accepts such an Offer and
commences employment with Buyer or its Affiliate is referred to herein as a

such individual; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall

such general advertisement or solicitation or who contacts Buyer or one of its Affiliates on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect
solicitation in contravention of the above restrictions or (iii) the
employment of any employee of Cogent or its Affiliates (including without
limitation Wyoming Operating Company, LLC) who, prior to the Closing Date,

to provide the Buyer reasonable access during normal business hours and on at
least 24-hours' notice to, and facilitate meetings with, Business Employees
who may become Transferred Employees or for purposes of making announcements
concerning and preparing for the consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller shall not and will instruct the
Employers (and any officer, director, manager or equityholder of the
Employers) not to offer any Business Employee any employment or service
position with any Person. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause to be provided to the Buyer such information as the Buyer may reasonably
request in writing with respect to compensation, service and other information
relating to the employment of the Business Employees, and the Seller shall
instruct the Employers to reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in connection
therewith.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the making of an Offer by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates or the commencement of employment of a Transferred Employee with
Buyer or its Affiliate shall not result in Buyer or its Affiliates assuming
any liabilities of any kind with respect or relating to the employment of any
Business Employee by any Employer ("Employment Liabilities"), which
liabilities shall remain liabilities of the Seller or the Employers, as
applicable. The Seller will cause Wyoming Operating Company, LLC, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to instruct Arrow, to promptly pay and satisfy
all Employment Liabilities to the extent due and payable, in each case
including, without limitation, all accrued vacation pay and any other
termination-related liabilities to the Transferred Employees relating to their
termination of employment with the Employers. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer shall not assume any liability for any performance or other bonuses for
Business Employees for any period, including the period within which falls the
Closing Date, and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Employers to pay out all such bonuses accrued through the Closing Date as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Seller will cause Wyoming Operating Company, LLC, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to request Arrow, to provide that the accrued
benefits and account balances of Transferred Employees under Employers' 401(k)
plans to be 100% vested effective as of the Closing Date.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred
Employee any right with respect to continuance of employment by Buyer or its
Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of Buyer or its
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any of the Transferred Employees at
any time, with or without cause, or restrict Buyer or its Affiliates in the
exercise of their independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms
and conditions of the employment of the Transferred Employees. Nothing herein
is intended as an amendment to any employee benefit plan.

Section 6.15. Financing Assistance. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
use reasonable efforts, and shall cause the Company, to provide, and shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to provide, Buyer with such information as reasonably
necessary to allow Buyer to comply with its obligations under Sections
6.11(a)(iv) and 6.11(b) of the MLP Credit Agreement; provided, that such
requested cooperation does not materially and adversely interfere with

reasonably available to the Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates or
their or their Affiliates' Representatives. ARTICLE VII

EVENTS OF LOSS; ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

Section 9.01. Events of Loss.

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss that occurs
during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date, if the aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the Assets of the
Company subject to such Event of Loss to a condition comparable in all
material respects to their condition prior to such Event of Loss, plus the
amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a
direct result of such Event of Loss, such amount pursuant to this clause (i)
to be determined by an independent third-party appraiser mutually selected by
the Parties (collectively, "Restoration Costs") and/or (ii) any one or more
Takings that occurs during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending
on the Closing Date, if the value of the property subject to such Taking plus
the amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as
a direct result of such Taking, such amount pursuant to this clause (ii) to be
determined by an independent third-party appraiser mutually selected by the
Parties (collectively, the "Condemnation Value"), is, in the aggregate, less
than or equal to $5,000,000 (a "Minor Loss"), Seller will work diligently to
complete or cause to be completed the repair, replacement or restoration of
the damaged Assets prior to the Closing. In the event Seller completes, or
causes to be completed, the repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged
Assets prior to the Closing, then Seller shall be entitled to receive and
retain an amount of any insurance, condemnation award or other third-party
proceeds received by the Company or by Buyer for such event not to exceed the
amount of any reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by Seller
in connection with such repair, replacement or restoration, and, following the
satisfactory completion of such repair, as determined in Buyer's reasonable
discretion, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify, or otherwise have any
liability to, Buyer with respect to any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller in or pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any event, fact, circumstance, occurrence or
condition giving rise to such Events of Loss and Takings (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that Losses with respect to (x) any Asset that is
not the subject of such Events of Loss or (y) any defect arising from Seller's
unsatisfactory repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged Assets, shall
not be deemed for this purpose to give rise to such Events of Loss), and no
such event, occurrence or condition shall be taken into account in determining
whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied. If
Seller is not able to cause the satisfactory restoration, repair or
replacement of the Assets affected by a Minor Loss prior to Closing or such
Minor Loss is not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, the
provisions of Section 9.01(c) will apply.

(b) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Seller set forth in Section
9.01(d), upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings
involving aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in excess of
$5,000,000 (a "Major Loss"), Seller shall have, in the case of a Major Loss
relating solely to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings, the option,
exercised by notice to Buyer, to restore, repair or replace the damaged Assets
prior to Closing to a condition comparable in all material respects to their
condition prior to such Event of Loss or Taking, as the case may be. If Seller
elects to so restore, repair or replace the Assets relating to a Major Loss,
which election shall be made by notice to Buyer prior to the Closing Date and
as soon as practicable following the occurrence and determination (pursuant to
Section 9.01(a)) of the Major Loss, Seller will work diligently to complete or
cause to be completed the repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged
Assets prior to the Closing, and the Closing Date shall be postponed for an
amount of time reasonably necessary to complete the restoration, repair or
replacement of such Assets (including, if necessary, the extension of the Outside Date to
allow for the restoration, repair or replacement of such Assets, but in no
event more than 30 days after such date). If Seller elects not to cause the
restoration, repair or replacement of the Assets affected by a Major Loss or
such Major Loss is not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, the
provisions of Section 9.01(c) will apply. In the event that Seller so elects
to cause the restoration, repair or replacement of the Assets affected by a
Major Loss, (i) Seller shall be entitled to utilize any insurance or other
third-party proceeds received thereby by the Company or by Seller prior to the
Closing, (ii) Seller shall be entitled to receive and retain any insurance or
other third-party proceeds (whether received on, prior to or following the
Closing) in respect of lost profits for the period through Closing, which (if
received following Closing) shall be remitted promptly by Buyer to Seller,
(iii) Buyer or the Company shall be entitled to receive and retain any
insurance or other third-party proceeds received following the Closing in
respect of lost profits for the period following Closing, which shall be
remitted promptly to Buyer by Seller if received by Seller, and (iv) any other
insurance or other third-party proceeds received by the Company following
Closing shall be remitted promptly by Buyer to Seller.

(c) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Seller set forth in Section
9.01(d), in the event that Seller elects not to cause the restoration, repair
or replacement of a Minor Loss or a Major Loss, or in the event that Seller,
having elected to cause the repair, replacement or restoration of the Minor
Loss or Major Loss, fails to cause its completion by the Closing Date or in
the event that a Minor Loss or Major Loss is not capable of being restored,
repaired or replaced, then the Parties shall, within thirty (30) days
following Seller's election not to cause the restoration, repair or
replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence and determination
(pursuant to Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(b)) of such Minor Loss or Major
Loss, as the case may be, adjust the Base Purchase Price downward by the
aggregate Restoration Cost and Condemnation Value, and proceed to Closing, or
in the event of a Minor Loss, if the Closing shall have already occurred, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Buyer, the amount of such Minor Loss. To assist Buyer
in its evaluation of any and all Events of Loss, Seller shall provide Buyer
such access to the affected Assets and such information as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection therewith. In the event of such adjustment of
the Base Purchase Price, (i) Seller shall be entitled to receive and retain
any insurance, condemnation award or other third-party proceeds received by
the Company or Seller before Closing, (ii) any insurance, condemnation award
or other third-party proceeds received by the Company or Buyer following
Closing shall be remitted promptly by Buyer to Seller, and (iii) Seller shall
not be obligated to indemnify, or otherwise have any liability to, Buyer with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by Seller in or pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any event,
fact, circumstance, occurrence or condition to the extent relating to or
arising from such Events of Loss and Takings (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that Losses with respect to any Asset that is not the
subject of such Events of Loss shall not be deemed for this purpose to relate
to or arise from such Events of Loss), and no such event, occurrence or
condition shall be taken into account in determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied.

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of $20,000,000, then either Buyer or Seller shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party delivered
within ten Business Days following the date of the determination of such
aggregate amount of Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value pursuant to
Section 9.01(a).

Section 9.02. Environmental Conditions. If during the period commencing on the
date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, Buyer's Phase II conducted
pursuant to Section 6.02(a) identified any Environmental Condition(s), then
the following provisions of this Section 9.02 shall apply: (a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to complete Remediation, consistent with applicable Environmental
Laws, of any such Environmental Condition identified prior to the Closing.
Seller shall provide reasonable documentation to Buyer evidencing that
Remediation of such Environmental Condition is complete. If Seller elects to
complete the Remediation, then Seller shall have the unilateral right to
extend the Closing Date for an amount of time reasonably necessary to complete
the Remediation (including, if necessary, the extension of the Outside Date to
allow for the restoration, repair or replacement of such Assets, but in no
event more than 60 days after such date).

(b) If Seller elects not to undertake Remediation of such Environmental
Condition(s) prior to the Closing Date or if Remediation cannot reasonably be
completed by the Closing Date, then:

(i) If the aggregate expected cost of Remediation for all such Environmental
Conditions that remain as of the Closing Date is less than or equal to
$1,000,000 (determined pursuant to Section 9.02(c), (d) and (e)) (a "Minor
Remediation"), then (I) the Parties shall proceed with the Closing, (II) Buyer
shall undertake the required Minor Remediation following the Closing, and
(III) Seller and Buyer shall execute a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent
to pay to Buyer from the Escrowed Cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer, the amount of the actual
costs incurred by Buyer to undertake such Minor Remediation;

(ii) If the aggregate expected cost of Remediation (determined pursuant to
Section 9.02(c), (d) and (e)) for all such Environmental Conditions existing
as of the Closing Date is greater than $1,000,000 (a "Major Remediation"),
then the Parties shall, within 30 days following Seller's election not to
undertake the required Major Remediation, adjust the Base Purchase Price
downward by the aggregate expected cost of such Major Remediation (determined
pursuant to Section 9.02(c), (d) and (e)), and proceed to Closing; provided
that, if the aggregate expected cost of Remediation (determined pursuant to
Section 9.02(c), (d) and (e)) for all such Environmental Conditions existing
as of the Closing Date is greater than $5,000,000, Buyer shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller delivered within ten
Business Days following the later of (I) the date the Parties mutually agree
on the aggregate expected cost of such Remediation or (II) the date the
environmental arbiters issue their written opinion pursuant to Section
9.02(d); and

(iii) In the event of such payment from the Escrowed Cash pursuant to Section
9.02(b)(i) or adjustment of the Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section
9.02(b)(ii), Seller shall in each case not be obligated to indemnify, or
otherwise have any liability to, Buyer with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller in or pursuant
to this Agreement with respect to any event, fact, circumstance, occurrence or
condition giving rise to or constituting such Environmental Condition, and no
such event, occurrence or condition shall be taken into account in determining
whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied.

(c) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in sharing information necessary
for developing an informed estimate for Remediation for any such Environmental
Condition prior to the Closing Date, including input from their respective
environmental professionals.

(d) If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on an expected cost of Remediation for
all such remaining Environmental Conditions, the dispute shall be resolved by
a panel of environmental arbiters acting by majority vote and selected
pursuant to the following procedure which, except as set forth in Section
9.02(e), shall not delay the Closing. Seller and Buyer shall each recommend a
qualified environmental professional to serve as an environmental arbiter, and
the two environmental arbiters so designated shall jointly select a third environmental arbiter who, unless consented to by the parties, has not
rendered services to Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates,
within the two years preceding such dispute. Following the selection of the
third environmental arbiter, Seller and Buyer shall each submit in writing to
the environmental arbiters such Party's good faith estimate of the aggregate
expected cost of such remaining Environmental Conditions, together with all
reasonable supporting documentation relating thereto. The environmental
arbiters shall consider all information submitted by Buyer and Sellers to make
the final determination, but shall not perform additional on-site studies or
evaluations unless agreed to by Seller and Buyer. The environmental arbiters
shall issue a written opinion setting forth their determination within 15 days
after the submissions by the Parties. The environmental arbiters'
determination shall be final and binding. Buyer and Seller shall each pay the
respective costs of the environmental arbiter selected by such Party and one-
half of the cost of the third environmental arbiter.

(e) In the event that a Remediation estimate submitted for dispute by either
party would trigger the termination criteria set forth in Section 9.02(b)(ii),
the Parties agree that the Closing Date shall be extended for up to 30 days to
allow the environmental arbiters to render a determination (including, if
necessary, the extension of the Outside Date to allow for the restoration,
repair or replacement of such Assets, but in no event more than 30 days after
such date).

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including in Section 9.01), the provisions in this
Section 9.02 shall constitute the sole remedy for any Environmental
Condition(s) identified in Buyer's Phase II conducted pursuant to Section
6.02(a).

to this Agreement shall not exceed the Escrowed Cash.

(e) Under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to duplicate recovery
under this Agreement with respect to (i) any indemnification claim pursuant to
this Article XI, even though the facts or series of related facts giving rise
to such claim may constitute a breach of more than one representation,
warranty or covenant or agreement set forth herein, or in any of the
agreements or instruments entered into in connection with the Closing or (ii)
any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06. (f) Under no circumstances shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Seller under this Article XI exceed the Base Purchase Price.

(g) Seller makes no representation or warranty, and provides no other
assurance, with respect to the amount of any Tax attributes of the Company or
any Subsidiary, or with respect to the availability on or after the Closing
Date of any Tax attributes of the Company or any Subsidiary.

Section 11.05. Claims Procedures.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim by a third party or circumstances
which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person believes are likely to
give rise to a Claim by a third party or of facts causing any indemnified
Person to believe it has a Claim for breach hereunder (an "Asserted
Liability"), such indemnified Person shall give prompt written notice thereof
(the "Claims Notice") to the relevant indemnifying Person. So long as the
Claims Notice is given within the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 11.01, the failure to so notify the indemnifying Person shall not
relieve the indemnifying Person of its obligations or liability hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have actually and materially
prejudiced the indemnifying Person. The Claims Notice shall describe the
Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered, the
specific provisions of this Agreement that were breached and the relevant
specific facts and circumstances constituting such breach. The indemnified
Person and the indemnifying Person agree to keep each other reasonably
appraised of any additional information concerning any Asserted Liability.

(b) The indemnifying Person shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the indemnified Person, to assume the defense of any
Asserted Liability arising from a third party action at the indemnifying
Person's expense and by the indemnifying Person's own counsel, and the
indemnified Person shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event
that the indemnifying Person assumes the defense of any Asserted Liability
arising from a third party action, subject to Section 11.05, it shall have the
right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such action in the name and on
behalf of the indemnified Person. The indemnified Person shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Asserted
Liability arising from a third party action with counsel selected by it
subject to the indemnifying Person's right to control the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying Person elects not to compromise or defend such Asserted
Liability arising from a third party action or fails to promptly notify the
indemnified Person in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the indemnified Person may, subject to Section 11.05, pay,
compromise, defend such action and seek indemnification for any and all Losses
based upon, arising from or relating to such action. The Parties shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, including
making available (subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement)
records relating to such action and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such action.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnifying
Person shall not enter into settlement of any Asserted Liability arising from
a third party action without the prior written consent of the indemnified
Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as provided in this Section 11.05(c). If a firm offer is made to settle an
Asserted Liability arising from a third party action without leading to
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the indemnified Person and provides for the unconditional release of the
indemnified Person from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such action and the indemnifying Person
desires to accept and agree to such offer, the indemnifying Person shall give
written notice to that effect to the indemnified Person. If the indemnified
Person fails to consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt
of such notice, the indemnified Person may continue to contest or defend such
Asserted Liability arising from a third party action and in such event, the
maximum liability of the indemnifying Person as to such Asserted Liability
arising from a third party action shall not exceed the amount of such
settlement offer. If the indemnified Person fails to consent to such firm
offer and also fails to assume defense of such Asserted Liability arising from
a third party action, the indemnifying Person may settle such action upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such action. If the indemnified
Person has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 11.05(c), it shall not
agree to any settlement without the written consent of the indemnifying Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Any claim by an indemnified Person on account of a Loss which does not
result from any Asserted Liability arising from a third party action shall be
asserted by the indemnified Person giving the indemnifying Person prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the indemnifying Person of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the indemnifying Person
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
indemnified Person shall describe the claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the indemnified Person. The indemnifying Person shall have 30
days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such claim.
During such 30-day period, the indemnified Person shall allow the indemnifying
Person and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the claim and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the claim, and the indemnified Person shall assist the
indemnifying Person's investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including access to the Company's premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the indemnifying
Person or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
indemnifying Person does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the indemnified Person shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the indemnified Person on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE

relating to or arising out of this Agreement (including breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) or any other Contract or
other matter delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or
otherwise, except for a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article XI.

CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

Section 11.08. Access to Information. After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall grant each other (or their respective designees), and Buyer shall cause
the Company to grant to Seller (or its designee), access at all reasonable
times to all of the books, records, documents, instruments, accounts,
correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers and electronic
files relating to the Business in Seller's or its Affiliates possession or the
possession of the Company (the "Records"), and shall afford such party the
right (at such party's expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of, or
to investigate or defend any Claims among the Parties and/or their Affiliates
arising under, this Agreement. Buyer shall maintain, and shall cause the
Company to maintain, such Records until the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date (or for such longer period of time as Seller shall advise Buyer is
necessary in order to have the Records available with respect to Tax matters),
or if any of the Records pertain to any Claim or dispute pending on the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of the
Records designated by Seller or its Representatives until such Claim or
dispute is finally resolved and the time for all appeals has been exhausted.

Section 11.09. Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation. The Losses
giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to
the Losses suffered by the indemnified Person and shall be reduced by any
insurance proceeds or other payment or monetary recoupment received or that
are actually realized or obtained by the indemnified Person as a result of the
events giving rise to the claim for indemnification. Any indemnified Person
that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to seek indemnification
hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts to
which it may be entitled under insurance policies or from third parties
(pursuant to indemnification agreements or otherwise) and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses.

Exhibit B-1

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
___________, 20__, by and among Casper Crude to Rail Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Seller"), USDP CCR LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Buyer"), and Citibank, National Association, as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Seller, Buyer and the Escrow Agent are referred to
herein sometimes individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."
Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them
in the MIPA (as defined below).

WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller entered into that certain Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 12, 2015 (the "MIPA"), under which
Buyer agreed to purchase from Seller, and Seller agreed to sell to Buyer, 100%
of the outstanding membership interests in Casper Crude to Rail, LLC, a
Wyoming limited liability company (the "Company"); and

WHEREAS, the MIPA contemplates the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the deposit by the Buyer with the Escrow Agent of $22,500,000 (the "Escrow
Amount") in order to provide a source of funding as described in the MIPA. The
Parties wish such deposit to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein and in the MIPA.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:

1. Appointment. Buyer and Seller hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2. Escrow Funds.

(a) Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Buyer
is depositing the Escrow Amount in immediately available funds with the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount,
together with all products and proceeds thereof, including all interest,
dividends, gains and other income (collectively, the "Escrow Earnings") earned
with respect thereto (collectively, the "Escrow Funds"), to be held in a
separate and distinct account (the "Escrow Account"), subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, all Escrow Earnings shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Escrow Funds. In accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, all such Escrow Earnings shall become, and
shall be disbursed as, part of the Escrow Funds.

3. Investment of Escrow Funds. Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Buyer and Seller, the Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in a "noninterest-bearing deposit account" insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to the applicable limits. The Escrow Funds shall at all times remain available for distribution in accordance with Section 4 below.

On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the end of each month, the
Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of Buyer and Seller
reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the preceding month that shall
include the account balance and any disbursements made pursuant to Section 4.



Exhibit B-2 4. Disposition and Termination of the Escrow Funds. The Parties shall act in accordance with, and the Escrow Agent shall hold and release the Escrow Funds as provided in, this Section 4 as follows:

(a) Release of Escrow Funds by Joint Release Instructions. Upon receipt of a
Joint Release Instruction with respect to the Escrow Fund (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, to satisfy any obligation of Buyer and/or Seller pursuant
to Sections 2.06, 2.07, 9.02 and 11.02 of the MIPA), the Escrow Agent shall
promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt of a
Joint Release Instruction, disburse all or part of the Escrow Fund in
accordance with such Joint Release Instruction.

(b) Claim Against the Escrow Funds.

---|--- 

(i)

|

At any time, and from time to time, on or prior to the Escrow Release Date (as
defined below), if Buyer makes a claim for indemnity pursuant to and in
accordance with Article XI of the MIPA (a "Claim"), then following, and
subject to, Buyer's compliance with all of the procedures and provisions set
forth in Article XI of the MIPA, Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent and
Seller a written notice (an "Escrow Notice") setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount (or, if such amount is not reasonably ascertainable, Buyer's
reasonable estimate of such amount), nature and basis of the Claim by Buyer.
If the Escrow Agent has not received a written objection to such Claim or
portion thereof or the amount of such Claim from the Seller within thirty (30)
days following the Escrow Agent's and Seller's receipt of such Escrow Notice,
then on the 35th day following such receipt, the Escrow Agent shall release,
by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer, an amount
of Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account equal to the amount of such Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If Seller in good faith delivers to the Escrow Agent and Buyer a written
objection (a "Dispute Notice") to any Claim or portion thereof or the amount
of such Claim within thirty (30) days following Seller's receipt of such
Escrow Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall not distribute to Buyer any portion
of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account that is the subject of the Dispute
Notice until the Escrow Agent receives either (A) Joint Release Instructions
authorizing the release to Buyer of the portion of the Escrow Funds in the
Escrow Account that is agreed upon as the amount recoverable in respect of the
Dispute Notice or (B) a Final Determination directing the release to Buyer of
the portion of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account that is determined to be
the amount recoverable in respect of the Dispute Notice; provided, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller objects in part to the amount of the
Claim, the Escrow Agent shall, after the lapse of the aforementioned thirty
(30) day period, deliver to Buyer an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the
portion of the Claim not objected to by the Seller. Upon receipt of such Joint
Release Instructions or such Final Determination, as the case may be, the
Escrow Agent shall release to Buyer such amount of the Escrow Funds in the
Escrow Account in accordance with such written instructions or final and non-
appealable order. 

 

Exhibit B-3 (c) Final Determination. If at any time either Buyer or Seller receives a
Final Determination (as defined herein), then upon receipt by the Escrow Agent
of a copy of such Final Determination from either Buyer or Seller, the Escrow
Agent shall (A) promptly deliver a copy of such Final Determination to the
other Party and (B) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following receipt by the
applicable Party from the Escrow Agent of the Final Determination, disburse
the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account to Buyer and/or Seller in accordance
with such Final Determination. Subject to the terms of this Section 4(c), the
Escrow Agent will act on such Final Determination without further inquiry.

(d) Release of Remaining Escrow Funds. On the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, or if, such date is not a Business Day, the
next succeeding Business Day (such date, as may be extended in accordance with
and pursuant to Section 6.09 of the MIPA, the "Escrow Release Date"), the
Escrow Agent shall release to Seller, in accordance with Section 4(e), the
remaining balance of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account less Buyer's good
faith estimate of the amount of any Unresolved Claims.

(e) Payment Instructions. All payments of any part of the Escrow Fund to Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds or cashier's check as set forth in the Joint Release
Instruction or Final Determination, as applicable, or, with respect to
payments of any part of the Escrow Fund to Seller under clause (d) above,
pursuant to the wire instructions set forth on Schedule I hereto.

(f) Authorized Individuals. In the event a Joint Release Instruction is
delivered to the Escrow Agent, whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instruction by
telephone to the person or persons designated in Exhibits A-1 and/or A-2
hereto (the "Authorized Individuals"), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmations of anyone purporting to be an Authorized Individual. To assure
accuracy of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such
confirmatory calls. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions,
or is not satisfied with the verification it receives, it will not execute the
instruction until all such issues have been resolved. The persons designated
as, and telephone numbers of, the Authorized Individuals may be changed upon
written notice to, and receipt of confirmation from, the Escrow Agent.

Exhibit B-5 5. Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between Buyer and Seller in connection herewith, including without limitation the MIPA, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release Instruction furnished to it hereunder and believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper Party or Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers' forms in the form of Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Funds. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in a Final Determination. The Escrow Agent may, after thirty (30) days' written notice to Buyer and Seller of its intention to do so, interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such declaratory judgment. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection in the event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation with respect to any error of judgment or for any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for the Escrow Agent's fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. To the extent practicable, Buyer and Seller agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute (other than with respect to a dispute involving the Escrow Agent) without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable, directly or indirectly, for any (a) damages, losses or expenses arising out of the services provided hereunder in good faith, other than damages, losses or expenses which result from the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.



Exhibit B-6 6. Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent (a) may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving sixty (60) calendar days' advance notice in writing of such resignation to Buyer and Seller specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect or (b) may be removed, with or without cause, by Buyer and Seller acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agent's corporate trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. Upon delivery of the Escrow Funds (i) to a substitute or successor escrow agent pursuant to a joint written designation from the Parties, (ii) as set forth in a Joint Release Instruction or (iii) in accordance with the directions of a Final Determination, the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. In the event the Escrow Agent resigns, if the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of sixty (60) calendar days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of such a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Escrow Agent or any successor escrow agent shall continue to act as Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as Escrow Agent.

7. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are described in Schedule II hereto and shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. The fees agreed upon for the services to be rendered hereunder are intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent services as contemplated by this Agreement.

8. Indemnity. Each of Buyer and Seller shall severally and jointly (as described more fully below) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively "Escrow Agent Losses") arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee, except to the extent that such Escrow Agent Losses have been caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent or any such Indemnitee, or (b) its following in good faith of any instructions or other directions from Seller or Buyer, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Seller agree, solely as between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this Section 8 (or for reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent described in Section 7) shall be borne by the party or parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

9. Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer shall be responsible for and the taxpayer on all taxes due on the
interest or income earned on the Escrowed Funds for the calendar year in which
such interest or income is



Exhibit B-7 earned. A W-9 for each of Buyer and Seller shall be provided to the Escrow
Agent upon execution of this Escrow Agreement.

(b) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the
preparation and/or filing of any tax return or withholding with respect to the
Escrow Amount or any Escrow Earnings. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any
taxes required to be withheld by applicable law, including but not limited to
required withholding in the absence of proper tax documentation, and shall
remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

10. Covenant of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants with Buyer and Seller that it shall perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and shall not deliver custody or possession of any of the Escrow Funds to anyone except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

Exhibit F-3 2. Confidentiality Agreement.

(a) From and after the date hereof, the obligations and covenants of Cogent
arising pursuant to that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 31,

Agreement, so long as such Cogent Group Member promptly notifies Buyer in
writing (if legally permissible) and discloses only that portion of such
Confidential Information which such Cogent Group Member is advised by its
counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that such
Cogent Group Member shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, so that Buyer may obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information.

3. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) Non-Competition. From the Closing Date until the third anniversary

business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in any aspect of a Competitive Business within the
Restricted Territory, other than for the benefit of Buyer and/or its
Affiliates, except that the Cogent Group Members and their respective
Affiliates shall not be restricted from owning MLP Common Units or from
acquiring, directly or indirectly, less than 1% of the outstanding capital
stock of any publicly traded company (other than USDP) that is engaged in a
Competitive Business.

(b) Non-Interference with Customers and Suppliers. From the Closing Date until
the third anniversary thereof, no Cogent Group Member shall cause, induce or
encourage, any actual or prospective customer, supplier or licensor of the
Company or CCR Pipeline or any other Commercial Counterparty to terminate or
modify any such relationship, in each case, within or with respect to the
Restricted Territory.

(c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. From the Closing Date until the third
anniversary thereof, no Cogent Group Member shall cause, solicit, induce or
encourage any employee, if any, of the Company or CCR Pipeline to leave such
employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual; provided,



Exhibit F-4 however, that nothing in this paragraph shall restrict (i) any general
advertisement or solicitation that is not directed at employees of the Company
or CCR Pipeline, or (ii) the employment of any person who responds to any such
general advertisement or solicitation or who contacts a Cogent Group Member or
one of its respective Affiliates on his or her own initiative and without any
direct or indirect solicitation in contravention of the above restrictions.

(d) Non-Disparagement. From the Closing Date until the third anniversary
thereof, no Cogent Group Member shall, and each Cogent Group Member will
direct its Representatives not to, make any statement with respect to the
Company, Buyer or their and their Affiliates' respective businesses, products
or services, either in writing or orally, to any Person that disparages,
discredits, degrades or lowers the reputation of the Company, Buyer or their
and their Affiliates' respective businesses, products or services, including
the publication of articles or press releases and interviews with individuals
or institutions engaged in the business of communication, publishing or
broadcasting news, opinion or other information, either on the record, off the
record, or "on background" unless provided with advance written authorization
from the Company or Buyer, as applicable, to do so, or encourage or
participate with any Person to make such statements.

(e) Non-Solicitation of Certain Employees by Buyer. From the Closing Date
until the first anniversary thereof, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
(without the prior written consent of Cogent) cause, solicit, induce or
encourage any employee of Cogent or its Affiliates (including without
limitation Wyoming Operating Company, LLC) who provide services to Cheyenne
Rail Hub, LLC to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any
such individual; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall
restrict (i) any general advertisement or solicitation that is not directed at
employees of Cogent or its Affiliates (including without limitation Wyoming
Operating Company, LLC), (ii) the employment of any person who responds to any
such general advertisement or solicitation or who contacts Buyer or one of its
Affiliates on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect
solicitation in contravention of the above restrictions or (iii) the
employment of any employee of Cogent or its Affiliates (including without
limitation Wyoming Operating Company, LLC) who, prior to the Closing Date,
provides services with respect to the Business or the Terminal Facilities.

(f) Certain Acknowledgements. Each of the Cogent Group Members and Buyer
acknowledge, in connection with the covenants and agreements in this Section
3(f), that (i) such covenants and agreements impose a reasonable restraint in
light of the activities and business and current plans with respect thereto of
the Cogent Group Members, (ii) it is the intention of the Parties that the
entire goodwill of the business of the Company be transferred to Buyer as part
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the goodwill existing
between the Company's business, on the one hand, and its clients, customers,
suppliers, agents, employees, contractors, consultants, and other Persons
under contract or otherwise associated or doing business with them, on the
other hand, and (iii) such covenants and agreements are supported by adequate
consideration.

(g) Injunctive Relief. The covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 3 relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 3 may cause
irreparable injury to Buyer, the Cogent Group Members or the Company, the
amount of which may be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be
adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this
Section 3 may be inadequate. Therefore, Buyer, each Cogent Group Member and
the Company will each be entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this Section 3 without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by
this Section 3 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
which Buyer and the Company may have hereunder or at law or in equity.



Exhibit F-5 (h) Reformation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the MIPA, the
Cogent Group Members and the Buyer agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified
time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or
any other relevant feature of this Section 3 is unreasonable, arbitrary or
against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced
against the applicable Party. If any Law or court interpreting such Law does
not allow such lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or
other relevant feature to be enforced against the applicable Party, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that Section 12.11 of the MIPA will apply.

4. Indemnification.

(a) Each of the Cogent Group Members shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify, save and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective

any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which indemnification
hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of
any of the foregoing, incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with, as a
result of, or arising out of, or relating or incident to (i) the inaccuracy or

this Agreement and the right of the Indemnitees to assert any Claim for
indemnification related thereto shall survive the Closing indefinitely and
shall continue in full force and effect thereafter. The covenants and
agreements of the Cogent Group Members contained in this Agreement shall

specified, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied); provided
that the right of an Indemnitee to make a claim for breach of any covenant of
a Cogent Group Member that is to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the
Closing shall survive for a period of 18 months after the Closing, after which

and the performance by CTRAN of its obligations hereunder, have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by CTRAN and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer) constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of CTRAN enforceable against CTRAN in
accordance with its terms and conditions, except that the enforcement hereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, arrangement or other similar Laws relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, or by general equitable
principles.

(c) Ownership of the Company Interests. Seller has good, valid and marketable
title to the Company Interests and owns beneficially and of record the Company
Interests, free and clear of all Liens



Exhibit G-2 other than those under state or federal securities Laws or the Company's
Charter Documents. Seller is not party to (i) any option, warrant, purchase
right or other Contract (other than the MIPA) that could require either Seller
or, after the Closing, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Company Interests or (ii) any
voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the voting or transfer
(other than the MIPA) of any Company Interests.

(d) Ownership of Seller. CTRAN has good, valid and marketable title to 50% of
the Common Units (as defined in the LLC Agreement) in Seller (the "CTRAN
Interests") and owns beneficially and of record the CTRAN Interests, free and
clear of all Liens other than those under state or federal securities Laws or
Seller's Charter Documents. CTRAN is not party to (i) any option, warrant,
purchase right or other Contract that could require CTRAN to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any CTRAN Interests or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or
other Contract with respect to the voting or transfer of any CTRAN Interests.

2. Confidentiality Agreement. From the Closing Date until the second anniversary thereof, CTRAN shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the Company, except to the extent that CTRAN can show that such information (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of CTRAN, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by CTRAN, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources which are not known to CTRAN to be prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If CTRAN or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any confidential information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, CTRAN shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information which CTRAN is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that CTRAN shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

3. Audits and Filings.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, CTRAN shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates, partners, members,
shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with Buyer, its Affiliates and their
respective agents and Representatives in connection with compliance with
Buyer's and its Affiliates' Tax, financial or other reporting requirements and
audits, including (i) any filings with any Governmental Authority and (ii) any

Affiliates, including the filing by Buyer or its Affiliates with the SEC of
one or more registration statements to register any securities of Buyer or its
Affiliates under the 1933 Act or of any report required to be filed by Buyer
or its Affiliates under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (together with the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under such acts, the
"Securities Laws") (collectively, the "Filings"). Further, from and after the
date of this Agreement, CTRAN shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause its Affiliates to, make available to Buyer and its Affiliates and their
agents and Representatives any and all books, records, information and
documents that are attributable to the Assets in CTRAN's or such Affiliates'
possession or control reasonably required by Buyer, its Affiliates and their
agents and Representatives in order to prepare for Buyer or its Affiliates, if
required, in connection with such Filings, financial statements relating to
the Assets or to CTRAN or its respective Affiliates meeting the requirements
of Regulation S-X under the 1933 Act, along with any documentation
attributable to the Assets or otherwise relating to CTRAN or its Affiliates
required to complete any audit associated with such financial statements.



Exhibit G-3 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the date
of this Agreement, CTRAN shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate with the independent auditors chosen by Buyer
("Buyer's Auditor") in connection with any audit by Buyer's Auditor of any
financial statements of the Assets or of Seller or its Affiliates that Buyer
or any of its Affiliates requires to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Laws or other Tax, financial or reporting requirements. Such
cooperation will include (i) reasonable access to CTRAN's officers, managers,
employees, agents and Representatives who were responsible for preparing or
maintaining the financial records and work papers and other supporting
documents used in the preparation of such financial statements as may be
required by Buyer's Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify
such financial statements and (ii) using reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the independent auditor(s) of Seller that conducted any audit of
such financial statements to be named as an expert in any report filed by
Buyer with the SEC. Buyer will reimburse CTRAN, within ten (10) Business Days
after demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable out of pocket costs
incurred by CTRAN or its Affiliates in complying with the provisions of this
Section 3(b).

(c) For a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, CTRAN shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, retain all books, records, information and
documents in its or its Affiliates' possession that are necessary to prepare
and audit financial statements with respect to the Assets or otherwise
relating to Seller or its Affiliates, except to the extent originals or copies
thereof are transferred to Buyer in connection with Closing.

4. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) Non-Competition. From the Closing Date until the third anniversary
thereof, CTRAN shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate,
control, consult, become employed by or participate in any manner in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, or consulting to, any
business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in any aspect of a Competitive Business (as defined in the
MIPA) within the Restricted Territory, except that CTRAN and its Affiliates
shall not be restricted from acquiring, directly or indirectly, less than 1%
of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a
Competitive Business.

(b) Non-Interference with Customers and Suppliers. From the Closing Date until
the third anniversary thereof, CTRAN shall not cause, induce or encourage, any
actual or prospective customer, supplier or licensor of the Company or CCR
Pipeline or any other Commercial Counterparty to terminate or modify any such
relationship, in each case, within or with respect to the Restricted
Territory.

(c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. From the Closing Date until the third
anniversary thereof, CTRAN shall not cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
employee, if any, of the Company or CCR Pipeline to leave such employment or
hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual; provided, however, that
nothing in this paragraph shall restrict (i) any general advertisement or
solicitation that is not directed at employees of the Company or CCR Pipeline,
or (ii) the employment of any person who responds to any such general
advertisement or solicitation or who contacts CTRAN or one of its Affiliates
on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation
in contravention of the above restrictions.

(d) Non-Disparagement. From the Closing Date until the third anniversary
thereof, CTRAN will not, and will cause its respective Affiliates not to, make
any statement with respect to the Company, Buyer or their respective
businesses, products or services, either in writing or orally, to any Person
that disparages, discredits, degrades or lowers the reputation of the Company,
Buyer or their and their Affiliates' respective businesses, products or
services, including the publication of articles or press releases and
interviews with individuals or institutions engaged in the business of
communication, publishing or



Exhibit G-4 broadcasting news, opinion or other information, either on the record, off the
record, or "on background" unless provided with advance written authorization
from the Company or Buyer, as applicable, to do so, or encourage or
participate with any Person to make such statements.

(e) Certain Acknowledgements. Both CTRAN and Buyer acknowledge, in connection
with the covenants and agreements in this Section 4(e), that (i) such
covenants and agreements impose a reasonable restraint in light of the
activities and business and current plans with respect thereto of CTRAN, (ii)
it is the intention of the Parties that the entire goodwill of the business of
the Company be transferred to Buyer as part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the goodwill existing between the Company's business, on the
one hand, and its clients, customers, suppliers, agents, employees,
contractors, consultants, and other Persons under contract or otherwise
associated or doing business with them, on the other hand, and (iii) such
covenants and agreements are supported by adequate consideration.

(f) Injunctive Relief. The covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 4(f) relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 4(f) may cause
irreparable injury to Buyer, CTRAN or the Company, the amount of which may be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this Section
4(f) may be inadequate. Therefore, Buyer, CTRAN and the Company will each be
entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this
Section 4(f) without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any
bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 4(f) are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer and
the Company may have hereunder or at law or in equity.

(g) Reformation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the MIPA, CTRAN
and the Buyer agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final
nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant
feature of this Section 4(g) is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public
policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or
other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not
arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable
Party. If any Law or court interpreting such Law does not allow such lesser
time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
to be enforced against the applicable Party, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Section 12.11 of the MIPA will apply.

5. Indemnification.

(a) CTRAN shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, indemnify, save and hold
harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective agents and Representatives
(each, an "Indemnitee" and collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against
any and all Claims (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to
the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and all amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing, incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with, as a result of, or arising out of, or relating
or incident to (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
of CTRAN in this Agreement; (ii) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant
or agreement of CTRAN in this Agreement; or (iii) any cause of action, suit or
claim brought or made against an Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from
(x) the execution, delivery, performance or breach of this Agreement or (y)
the enforcement of this Agreement.

(b) All of the representations and warranties of CTRAN in this Agreement and
the right of the Indemnitees to assert any Claim for indemnification related
thereto shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall continue in full
force and effect thereafter. The covenants and agreements of CTRAN contained



Exhibit G-5 in this Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms
(or, if no term is specified, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied); provided that the right of an Indemnitee to make a claim for
breach of any covenant of CTRAN that is to be performed or satisfied at or
prior to the Closing shall survive for a period of 18 months after the
Closing, after which date and time no Claims for indemnification therefor may
be asserted, regardless of when such right arose.

and file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the
public resale of all of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (an
"Initial Registration Statement") and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Initial Registration Statement to become effective on
the 365th day following the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter. The Initial Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section
2(a) shall be on such appropriate registration form or forms of the SEC as
shall be selected by the Partnership; provided, that, if the Initial
Registration Statement is on Form S-1, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Partnership becomes eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3,
then the Partnership shall post-effectively amend the Initial Registration
Statement on Form S-1 to convert such Initial Registration Statement to a Form
S-3 or, if a registration statement on Form S-1 has not been filed, then file
a registration statement on Form S-3 as soon as reasonably practicable to
permit the public resale of all of the Registrable Securities then outstanding
(such



Exhibit I-4 Initial Registration Statement as so amended or such registration statement on
Form S-3 as so filed, the "Registration Statement"). The Partnership shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2(a) to be effective, supplemented and amended to the
extent necessary to ensure that it is available for the resale of all
Registrable Securities until all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have ceased to be Registrable Securities. The
Registration Statement when effective (including the documents incorporated
therein by reference, if any) will comply as to form in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained in
such Registration Statement or documents incorporated therein by reference, in
the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made). As soon as
practicable following the date that the Registration Statement becomes
effective, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of such date, the
Partnership shall provide the holders of Registrable Securities with written
notice of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

(b) Registration Obligations and Procedures.

(i) If, after filing the Registration Statement as set forth in Section 2(a),
the Board determines that the offering under such Registration Statement would
materially and adversely affect a pending or proposed transaction by the
Partnership, then the Partnership shall have the right to suspend the use of a
Registration Statement for a period of not more than forty-five (45) days in
succession. The Partnership shall not be permitted to provide such notice more
than twice in any three hundred sixty (360) day period. In the case of an
event that causes the Partnership to suspend the use of a Registration
Statement (a "Suspension Event"), the Partnership shall give a notice to the
Holders (a "Suspension Notice") to suspend sales of the Registrable Securities
and such notice shall state generally the basis for the notice and that such
suspension shall continue only for so long as the Suspension Event or its
effect is continuing. The Holders shall not effect any sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement at any time
after it has received a Suspension Notice and prior to receipt of an End of
Suspension Notice (as defined below). The Holders may recommence effecting
sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
following further written notice to such effect (an "End of Suspension
Notice") from the Partnership, which End of Suspension Notice shall be given
by the Partnership to the Holders promptly following the conclusion of any
Suspension Event or its effect.

(ii) In connection with the Partnership's registration obligations under
Section 2(a), the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such registration to permit the offer and transfer of such Registrable
Securities as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, and in connection
therewith, the Partnership shall:

(A) prepare and file the required Registration Statement, including all
exhibits and financial statements required under the Securities Act to be
filed therewith, and before filing with the SEC a Registration Statement or
prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to the Holders
copies of all documents prepared to be filed;



Exhibit I-5 (B) promptly notify the Holders and provide copies of the relevant documents,
as soon as reasonably practicable after notice thereof is received by the
Partnership (A) when the applicable Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto has been filed or becomes effective, and the applicable prospectus or
any amendment or supplement to such prospectus has been filed, (B) of any
comments (written or oral) by the SEC or any request (written or oral) by the
SEC or any other governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement, such prospectus, or for any additional information,
(C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement, any order preventing or suspending the use of
any preliminary or final prospectus, or the initiation or threatening of any
proceedings for such purposes and (D) of the receipt by the Partnership of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Registrable Securities for offering or transfer in any jurisdiction or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose;

(C) (1) promptly notify the Holders when the Partnership becomes aware of the
occurrence of any event as a result of which the applicable Registration
Statement or the prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then
in effect) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such
prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, or if for any other reason it shall be
necessary during such time period to amend or supplement such Registration
Statement or prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, and (2) in
either case, as quickly as possible thereafter using all commercially
reasonable efforts, prepare and file with the SEC, and furnish without charge
to the Holders, an amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such
compliance;

(D) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or obtain the
withdrawal of any stop order or other order suspending the use of any
preliminary or final prospectus;

(E) promptly (A) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post- effective
amendment such information as the Holders agree should be included therein
relating to the plan of distribution with respect to such Registrable
Securities and (B) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment;

(F) furnish to the Holders, without charge, as many conformed copies as the
Holders may reasonably request of the applicable Registration Statement and
any amendment or post-effective amendment thereto, including financial
statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and
all exhibits (including those incorporated by reference);

(G) deliver to the Holders, without charge, as many copies of the applicable
prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or
supplement thereto as the Holders may reasonably request (it being understood
that the Partnership consents to the use of such prospectus or any amendment
or



Exhibit I-6 supplement thereto by the Holders in connection with the offering and transfer
of the Registrable Securities covered by such prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto) and such other documents as the Holders may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the transfer of the Registrable Securities by
the Holders;

(H) in connection with any transfer of Registrable Securities that will result
in such securities no longer being Registrable Securities, cooperate with the
Holders to (A) facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates
representing Registrable Securities to be transferred and not bearing any
restrictive Securities Act legends and (B) register such Registrable
Securities in such denominations and such names as the Investors may request
at least two (2) Business Days prior to such transfer of Registrable
Securities; provided that the Partnership may satisfy its obligations
hereunder without issuing physical stock certificates through the use of the
Depository Trust Company's Direct Registration System;

(I) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority and each securities exchange, if any, on which
any of the Partnership's securities are then listed or quoted and on each
inter-dealer quotation system on which any of the Partnership's securities are
then quoted;

(J) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement from
and after a date not later than the effective date of such Registration
Statement;

(K) cause all Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which any of the
Partnership's securities are then listed or quoted and on each inter-dealer
quotation system on which any of the Partnership's securities are then quoted;
and

(L) comply with all requirements of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and other
applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as all applicable stock
exchange rules.

(d) The Partnership shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with a
Registration Statement, whether or not any such registration becomes
effective.

Section 3. Cooperation by Holders. The Partnership shall have no obligation to
include in a registration statement pursuant to Section 2, Registrable
Securities of a Holder if such Holder fails to timely furnish such information
that, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, is reasonably required in
order for a registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to
comply with the Securities Act.

Section 4. Indemnification and Contribution.

(a) The Partnership agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, each selling Holder and any of its officers,
directors, employees, controlling persons, fiduciaries, members,
representatives and each other Person (if any) that controls such Holder
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act (each, an "Holder Indemnified Party") from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) ("Losses") caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact



Exhibit I-7 contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Partnership shall
have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not apply to that
portion of such Losses caused by, or arising out of, any untrue statement, or
alleged untrue statement or any such omission or alleged omission, to the
extent such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Partnership by or on behalf of
such Holder Indemnified Party expressly for use therein, and (ii) any
violation by the Partnership of any federal, state or common law rule,
regulation or law applicable to the Partnership and relating to action
required of or inaction by the Partnership in connection with any registration
or offering of securities. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Partnership shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission (x) made in any preliminary
prospectus if (A) a Holder failed to deliver or cause to be delivered a copy
of the prospectus to the Person asserting such Loss after the Partnership had
furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same and (B)
the prospectus completely corrected in a timely manner such untrue statement
or omission, or (y) in the prospectus, if such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is completely corrected in an
amendment or supplement to the prospectus and such Holder thereafter fails to
deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently
with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such Loss after the
Partnership had furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of
the same. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Party or
representative of such Holder Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer
of securities by Holder.

(b) Each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Partnership, its officers, Directors, employees, controlling
persons, fiduciaries, general or limited partners, representatives and each
other Person (if any) that controls the Partnership within the meaning of
either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from
and against any and all Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to Registrable
Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Partnership shall have furnished
any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
only to the extent such statement or omission (i) was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or prospectus
relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any preliminary prospectus and (ii) has not been corrected in a
subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to
the Person asserting such Loss.

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be
instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to Section 4(a) or Section 4(b), such Person (the "Indemnified
Party") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing (provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 4, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give
notice), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such
proceeding and, unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the
Indemnified Party



Exhibit I-8 a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party
may exist in respect of such claim, to assume the defense thereof jointly with
any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to the extent that it
chooses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and
after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party that it so
chooses, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that (i) if the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding
within twenty (20) days after receiving notice from such Indemnified Party
that the Indemnified Party believes it has failed to do so, (ii) if such
Indemnified Party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which is also
brought against the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party
which are not available to the Indemnifying Party or (iii) if representation
of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct then, in any such case, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense
as set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in each jurisdiction, except to the extent any Indemnified
Party or Parties reasonably shall have concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to such party or parties which are not available to the
other Indemnified Parties or to the extent representation of all Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct) and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for any expenses therefor. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or
potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment (A) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such action or claim and (B) does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act,
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is unavailable to an
Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses in respect of which indemnity is to
be provided hereunder, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying
such Indemnified Party, shall to the fullest extent permitted by law
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of such party in connection with the statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Partnership (on the one hand) and
the selling Holder (on the other hand) shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission.

(e) The Partnership and each Holder agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 4(d). The
amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the Losses
referred to in Section 4(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.



Exhibit I-9 Section 5. Rule 144.

The Partnership covenants that so long as the Common Units are registered
pursuant to Section 12(b), Section 12(g) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
it will used its commercially reasonable efforts to file any and all reports
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (or,
if the Partnership is not required to file such reports, to make publicly
available such necessary information for so long as necessary to permit sales
pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act) and
that it will take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable any Holder to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation
S under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the written
request of any Holder, the Partnership will deliver to the Holders a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

Section 6. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal and
unenforceable by any court of law, the remaining provisions shall be severable
and enforceable in accordance with their terms.

Section 7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its choice or conflict
of law provisions or rules.

(b) The parties to this Agreement agree that jurisdiction and venue in any
action brought by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall
exclusively and properly lie in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, the federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of Delaware. By execution and
delivery of this Agreement each party hereto irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts for himself and in respect of his property with
respect to such action. The parties hereto irrevocably agree that venue for
such action would be proper in such court and hereby waive any objection that
such court is an improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of such
action. The parties further agree that the mailing by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, of any process required by any such court
shall constitute valid and lawful service of process against them, without
necessity for service by any other means provided by statute or rule of court.

Section 8. JURY TRIAL.

BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE
MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND
THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN
ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A
JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST
COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND/OR ARBITRATION, THE
PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHT OR REMEDIES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENTS ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN.

Section 9. Transfer or Assignment; Benefits of Agreement.



Exhibit I-10 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Partnership, Cogent and their respective successors and assigns. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted to Cogent by
the Partnership under Section 2 and all other rights of Cogent hereunder may
be transferred or assigned by Cogent, or a Holder, to one or more
transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities; provided,
however, that (a) such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of Cogent or
such Holder, (b) the Partnership is given written notice prior to any said
transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee
or assignee and identifying the Registrable Securities with respect to which
such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and (c) each such
transferee or assignee agrees to be bound by this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no Person that is not a party to this
Agreement, as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, shall be entitled to
enforce any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

Section 10. Notices.

All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given if personally
delivered or sent by telecopier, sent by nationally recognized overnight
courier, sent by e-mail (so long as a receipt of such e-mail is requested or
delivered) or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return

Section 11. Modification; Waiver.

This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written
instrument duly executed by the Partnership, on the one hand, and Investors
holding a majority of the Preferred Shares that are not held by the
Partnership or its Affiliates, on the other hand. No course of dealing between
the Partnership or its Subsidiaries and Investors or any delay in exercising
any rights hereunder will operate as a waiver of any rights of any party to
this Agreement. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of
this Agreement will in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and
will not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Section 12. Entire Agreement.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and

therewith, from and after the completion of the IPO. Unless otherwise provided
herein, any consent required by either party may be withheld by such party in
its sole discretion.

Section 13. Specific Performance.

Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that a remedy at law for any breach
or attempted breach of this Agreement will be inadequate, agrees that each
other party to this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and
injunctive and other equitable relief in case of any such breach or attempted
breach, and further agrees to waive (to the extent legally permissible) any
legal conditions required to be met for the obtaining of any such injunctive
or other equitable relief (including posting any bond in order to obtain
equitable relief).

Section 14. Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such
counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such
counterparts taken together shall constitute but one agreement.

Section 15. Further Assurances.

Each party hereto shall do and perform or cause to be done and performed all
such further acts and things and shall execute and deliver all such other
agreements, certificates, instruments and other documents as any other party
hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Exhibit J-1

Membership Interest Purchase Agreement TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into on
__________, 2015 by and between Cogent Energy Solutions, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Contractor"), and Casper Crude to Rail, LLC, a
Wyoming limited liability company (the "Company"). Contractor and the Company
may be referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties."

WHEREAS, on October 12, 2015, Contractor's Affiliate, Casper Crude to Rail
Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Seller"), and USDP CCR
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company "Buyer"), entered into a Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement (as amended or otherwise modified, the "Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Seller agreed to sell all of
the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Company to Buyer; and

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, Contractor operated the Company and provided
certain services with respect to the Company; and

WHEREAS, to effect the orderly transfer of the Company from Seller to Buyer,
Buyer desires that Contractor provide to the Company certain transition
services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

DEFINITIONS. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms in
this Agreement have the meanings given to such terms in the Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

SCOPE OF SERVICES. Effective as of the Closing Date, Contractor will provide
to the Company the services described on Exhibit A attached hereto (each, a
"Service" and collectively, the "Services"). 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

INFORMATION. The Company agrees to provide Contractor in a timely manner with
any information reasonably necessary for Contractor to provide the Services
hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

LIMITATION ON SERVICES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall Contractor be obligated hereunder in connection
with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement to: (a) unless
otherwise agreed to between the Parties in writing, provide Services that
Contractor did not perform for the Company prior to the Closing Date or
perform any such Services in a manner substantially different from the manner
in which Contractor performed such Services for the Company prior to the
Closing Date; (b) provide any records, information, or data in any form or
format except that in which Contractor currently maintains such records,
information, or data; (c) make modifications to its existing systems or
properties; (d) acquire additional assets, equipment, rights, or properties
(including computer equipment, software, furniture, furnishings, fixtures,
machinery, vehicles, tools and other tangible personal property) that are not
in the ordinary course of operations of Contractor; (e) hire additional
employees; (f) pay any costs related to the transfer or conversion of data
from Contractor or its Affiliates to the Company; or (g) incur any obligations
or liabilities, except, in each case, as expressly set forth in this Agreement
or the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges that
(a) Contractor is not a professional provider of the types of services
included in the Services; (b) the personnel



Exhibit J-2 providing such Services may have other responsibilities to the business of
Contractor and its Affiliates to which said personnel are required to devote
substantial time that may take priority over the provision of Services from
time to time, to the extent consistent with Contractor's past practices in
such regard; (c) such personnel will not be dedicated full-time to performing
the Services; and (d) certain personnel of Contractor may leave the employment
of Contractor or terminate their employment or contract with Contractor during
the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that Contractor shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any interruption in Services
resulting from such departures and to resume as soon as reasonably practicable
the Services in the manner agreed hereunder. The Company acknowledges that all
Services to be provided under this Agreement shall be provided by Contractor
to the extent that such Services do not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business and operations of Contractor and its Affiliates, to the
extent consistent with Contractor's or such Affiliate's past practices, and
the loss of any Contractor's personnel may materially impede Contractor's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Except as provided above,
Contractor makes no representation or warranty regarding the ability of
Contractor to retain any employees, contractors, or subcontractors and
Contractor shall have no liability as to the result of the loss of any such
employees, contractors, or subcontractors. Contractor shall not be responsible
for the accuracy of any information filed with any governmental authority or
furnished to the Company or to any of the Company's employees for inclusion in
any reports or for results obtained by use of any inaccurate information so
filed or furnished, except, in each case, to the extent such information is
provided or furnished by Contractor or one of its Affiliates.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Contractor
shall perform, or cause to be performed, the Services in a manner that is
substantially similar in nature, timing and quality, and with the same degree
of skill, prudence and care, as the actions comprising the Services were
previously performed by Contractor in accordance with past practices prior to
the Closing Date; provided, however, in no event shall Contractor have any
obligations or liability hereunder except to the extent expressly set forth
herein. Further, if the Company fails to consent to any reasonable request
made by Contractor hereunder or fails to provide Contractor with any
reasonably necessary information required by Contractor as contemplated in
Section 3 above, Contractor shall be excused from the performance of, and
shall bear no liability associated with, the Services that Contractor sought
to perform in connection with such consent request or that are dependent upon
the information requested. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

TERMINATION. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the execution date
hereof and will continue thereafter for a period three months (the "Initial
Term"), after which the term of this Agreement shall be extended on a month to
month basis (each a "Renewal Term"); provided that, upon not less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Contractor, the Company may terminate the
Services (in whole or in part) as of the expiration of the Initial Term or any
Renewal Term; provided, further, that in no event shall the term of this
Agreement extend beyond the six month anniversary of the date hereof. The
Initial Term and any Renewal Terms are collectively referred to herein as the
"Term". 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

PAYMENTS. The Company shall pay Contractor a fee of $30,000 per month (the
"Fee") for performance of the Services hereunder. Contractors shall send the
Company an invoice for the Fee owed by the Company for the Services provided
during the prior calendar month (pro rated for any partial month). No later
than the tenth (10th) Business Day after its receipt of such invoice, the
Company shall pay Contractor the Fee set forth on such invoice. If the Company
fails to pay any amounts owed under this Agreement when due, such amounts
shall accrue interest at an interest rate of the Prime Rate as published from
time to time in the Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%), 

 

Exhibit J-3 or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, from the
due date until paid. For such time as any employees of or consultants or
subcontractors to Contractor (or any subcontractor) are providing the Services
to Company under this Agreement, (a) such employees or consultants will remain
employees or consultants of Contractor (or any subcontractor), as applicable,
and shall not be deemed to be employees of or consultants to the Company for
any purpose, and (b) Contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment
and provision of all compensation, wages, bonuses and commissions, employee
benefits, including severance and worker's compensation, and the withholding
and payment of applicable taxes relating to such employment or engagement.

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

CONFIDENTIALITY. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2)
years thereafter, Contractor shall, and shall cause each member of the
Contractor Group to, hold in confidence (and not disclose or provide access to
any other Person) and not use, except in each case for the benefit of the
Company and as reasonably required in providing the Services contemplated by
this Agreement, any and all confidential or proprietary information provided
by the Company to the Contractor Group in connection with the Services,
whether written or oral, concerning the Company, except to the extent that
Contractor can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and
known by the public other than as a result of a violation of this Agreement by
a member of the Contractor Group; (ii) was lawfully acquired by a member of
the Contractor Group from and after the Closing Date from sources which are
not known to such member of the Contractor Group to be prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation;
or (iii) was independently developed by a member of the Contractor Group
without use of any such confidential information. If a member of the
Contractor Group is compelled to disclose any such confidential information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law, such
disclosure shall not be a breach of this Agreement, so long as Contractor
promptly notifies the Company in writing (if legally permissible) and
discloses only that portion of such confidential information which Contractor
is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided,
