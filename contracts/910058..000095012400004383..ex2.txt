8     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 20, 2000
(the "Agreement"), among DAIMLERCHRYSLER NORTH AMERICA HOLDING CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation ("DCNA"), which is wholly owned by DaimlerChrysler AG,
a German Aktiengesellschaft ("DCAG"), DIESEL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"), which is wholly owned by DCNA, and
DETROIT DIESEL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").  
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of DCNA, the Purchaser and the Company deem
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders that
DCNA acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof it is
proposed that the acquisition be accomplished by the Purchaser\'s commencing
a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance
with this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common
Stock"), of the Company (the shares of Company Common Stock being referred to
herein as the "Shares"), for $23.00 per Share (such amount or any greater
amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as
the "Offer Price"), subject to applicable withholding Taxes, net to the
seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;   WHEREAS, a special committee (the "Special Committee") of
the Company\'s Board of Directors consisting of independent directors
unaffiliated with DCAG, DCNA, the Purchaser or Penske Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and an indirect stockholder of the Company ("Penske"), has
reviewed and considered the Offer, the Merger and the terms of this Agreement
and has unanimously recommended that the Company\'s Board of Directors
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the merger of the Purchaser with and into the Company (the
"Merger");   WHEREAS, in accordance with such recommendation the Board
of Directors of the Company has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and
resolved to recommend that holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to
the Offer and adopt this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of
DCNA (on its own behalf      9   and as the sole stockholder of the
Purchaser) and the Purchaser have each approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL") and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;  
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of DCNA and the Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, DCNA and DDC Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation indirectly wholly owned by Penske ("DDC Holdings"),
which owns 11,240,000 outstanding Shares, have entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which DCNA and the
Purchaser will purchase such Shares owned by DDC Holdings as provided therein
(the "Stock Purchase Agreement");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to
the willingness of DCNA and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
Penske has entered into a Stock Put Option Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, with the Company, granting the Company an irrevocable put option to
sell to Penske 51% of the outstanding capital stock of VM Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, all as set forth in the form of Stock Put Option
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "VM Put Option");   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, DCNA, the Purchaser and the Company agree as follows:    ARTICLE
I    Section 1.1 The Offer.   (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and none of the events
set forth in paragraphs (a) through (i) of Annex A hereto shall have occurred
or be existing (and shall not have been waived by the Purchaser), the
Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than the seventh
business day after the date hereof. The obligation of the Purchaser to accept
for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to the satisfaction of the condition that there be validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number
of Shares which, when added to the number of Shares currently owned by DCNA,
represents at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares on a fully
diluted basis (the "Minimum    10   Condition") and to the satisfaction
or earlier waiver by the Purchaser of the other conditions set forth in Annex
A hereto. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered to the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. The
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions (other
than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the
Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided,
however, that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the
Company which decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, reduces the
maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, modifies or amends any of
the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, imposes conditions to the Offer
in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, waives the
Minimum Condition or makes other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer that are in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or, except as
provided below, extends the Offer. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement and the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the
Offer set forth in Annex A hereto as of any expiration date of the Offer, the
Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is permitted to do so under
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may, without the
consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer beyond the scheduled expiration
date, which shall be 20 business days following the date of commencement of
the Offer, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the
conditions to the Purchaser\'s obligation to accept for payment and to pay
for the Shares shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this
Agreement, earlier waived or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Unless
the Company advises the Purchaser that it does not wish the Purchaser to
extend the Offer, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time
until the earlier of (A) the date that is 30 days after the date on which the
Regulatory Condition (as defined in Annex A) is satisfied or (B) the Drop
Dead Date, in the event that, at the then-scheduled expiration date, all of
the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto have not been
satisfied or earlier waived as permitted by this Agreement. Any extension of
the Offer pursuant to the preceding sentence or clause (i) of the second
preceding sentence or this Section 1.1 shall not exceed the lesser of
ten business days or such fewer number of days that the Purchaser
reasonably believes are necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer set
forth in Annex A hereto to be satisfied. The Purchaser shall provide a
"subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) of not less than three business days following its acceptance
for payment of Shares in the Offer. On or prior to the dates that the
Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant
to   11   the Offer, DCNA shall provide or cause to be provided to the
Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for all Shares that the Purchaser
becomes so obligated to accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer.
The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be net
to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer.   (b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain
or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase")
and forms of the related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary
Offer documents (collectively, together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents"). DCNA and the Purchaser shall cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. DCNA and the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Purchaser will cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, DCNA and the Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel
with any comments, whether written or oral, that DCNA or the Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments
and to consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any
such comments.   Section 1.2 Company Actions.   (a) The Company hereby
approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the
Company\'s Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
determined that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the
best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Purchaser thereunder and
adopt this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.7, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board
described in the immediately preceding sentence.   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on    12    Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9")
which shall contain the recommendation referred to in clause (iii) of Section
1.2(a) hereof. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated
to holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and each of DCNA and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, will promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
will cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. DCNA and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company
agrees to provide DCNA, the Purchaser and their counsel with any comments,
whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt of such comments and to consult with DCNA, the
Purchaser and their counsel prior to responding to any such comments.   (c)
The Company shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish the
Purchaser with such additional information, including, without limitation,
updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other assistance as DCNA, the
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements
of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer
or the Merger, DCNA and the Purchaser shall hold in confidence the
information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 or if the Offer is
otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Company all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in
their possession or in the possession of their agents or representatives.  
Section 1.3 Directors of the Company.   (a) Promptly upon the purchase of
and payment for Shares    13    by the Purchaser or any of its
affiliates pursuant to the Offer, DCNA shall be entitled to designate such
additional number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the
Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the total number of directors on such Board (giving effect to the
directors to be designated by DCNA pursuant to this sentence) by the
percentage that the number of Shares so purchased and paid for bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company
shall, upon request of the Purchaser, promptly increase the size of its Board
of Directors or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors, or both, as is necessary to enable DCNA\'s designees to
be so elected to the Company\'s Board and, subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, shall cause DCNA\'s
designees to be so elected. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by
DCNA, also cause directors designated by DCNA to constitute at least the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company\'s
Board of Directors of each committee of the Company\'s Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer,
there shall be until the Effective Time at least two members of the
Company\'s Board of Directors who are directors on the date hereof and are
members of the Special Committee.   (b) The Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under
Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders together with the Schedule
14D-9 the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary to enable DCNA\'s designees to be elected to the Company\'s Board
of Directors. DCNA and the Purchaser will supply the Company and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to them and their nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.   (c) Following the election of DCNA\'s designees to the Company\'s
Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 1.3, prior to the Effective Time
(i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any
extension or waiver by the Company of the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of DCNA or the Purchaser under this Agreement,
or (iii) any waiver of any of the Company\'s rights hereunder shall, in any
such case, require the concurrence of a majority of the remaining directors
who were members of the Special Committee (the "Independent Director
Approval").    14    ARTICLE II   THE MERGER   Section 2.1 The
Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time the
Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of the Purchaser shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of a public as well as of a private nature and shall be subject to
all of the restrictions, disabilities, duties, debts and obligations of the
Company and the Purchaser, all as provided in the DGCL.   Section 2.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00
a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which
shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those to be satisfied
at Closing), unless another time or date, or both, are agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto. The Closing will be held at the offices of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York,
unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.   Section 2.3
Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing
Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL
(the "Certificate of Merger") or a certificate of ownership and merger (the
"Certificate of Ownership and Merger") in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL, as applicable, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger or Certificate of Ownership and
Merger or at such other time as is agreed by the parties hereto and specified
in the Certificate of Merger or Certificate of Ownership and Merger (the time
at which the Merger becomes fully effective being hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time").   Section 2.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.   Section 2.5
Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws.   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that    15   Article FIRST of
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read in its entirety as follows: "FIRST: The name of
the corporation is Detroit Diesel Corporation" and as so amended shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such Certificate of
Incorporation.   (b) At the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Purchaser,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-
laws.   Section 2.6 Directors; Officers of Surviving Corporation.   (a)
The directors of the Purchaser at the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.7 Conversion of
Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders of any securities of the Purchaser or the
Company:   (a) Each Share that is owned by DCNA, the Purchaser, any of
their respective Subsidiaries, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) Each issued and
outstanding Share, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.7(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price in cash (the "Merger Consideration"),
payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in Section 2.8, of the certificate that formerly
evidenced such Share. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist,   16    and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.8.   (c) Each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Purchaser shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.8 Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, DCNA shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of the Shares (other than Shares held by DCNA and its Subsidiaries,
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Dissenting Shares) in connection with
the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") to receive in trust, the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7(b). DCNA shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with
the Exchange Agent promptly following the Effective Time. Such aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
DCNA or the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after
the Effective Time, DCNA and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each holder of record, as of the Effective Time, of a certificate
or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), whose Shares were converted pursuant
to Section 2.7(b) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as DCNA may reasonably specify) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by DCNA, together with such letter of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to
a    17    Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each Share in cash as contemplated by
this Section 2.8.   (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the
Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (d) Termination
of Fund; No Liability. At any time following the 180th calendar day of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Exchange Agent,
and holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or other similar law.   (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the event any Certificates for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by DCNA, the posting by such Person of a bond in such sum as DCNA may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate(s), the
Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(b)
deliverable in respect of the Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates.   (f) Withholding Taxes. DCNA and the Purchaser
shall be    18    entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Offer Price or the Merger
Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger any such amounts as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by DCNA or the
Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by DCNA or the Purchaser.   Section
2.9 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares (the "Dissenting Shares") that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders
who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply with all of the
relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Stockholders") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until the holder or
holders thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holder\'s Shares shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration for each Share without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give DCNA (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with
the prior written consent of DCNA, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the Shares held by such Dissenting
Stockholder shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.7(b).    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth on the schedule delivered by the Company to
DCNA prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company   
19    Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to DCNA
and the Purchaser as set forth below:   Section 3.1 Organization,
Qualification, Etc.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, has the corporate power and authority required for it to own its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions
in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any state of facts,
event, change or effect having a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect
to the Company or DCNA, as the case may be, means such state of facts, event,
change or effect that is not disclosed in Section 3.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and that has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations,
assets or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or DCNA and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be.
The Company has delivered or made available to DCNA copies of the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company. Such certificate of
incorporation and by-laws are complete and correct and in full force
and effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws.   (b) Each of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other business entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

the corporate or other organizational power and authority required for it to
own its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and (ii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership
interests in, the Company\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and, with respect to such shares or
ownership interests that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, are
free and clear of all liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges,
security interests, equities or charges of any kind (each, a "Lien"). Except
as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in,
the Company\'s Subsidiaries are wholly owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly. Other than the Subsidiaries listed in Section 3.1 of  
20    the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no Persons in which the
Company owns, of record or beneficially, any direct or indirect equity or
similar interest or any right (contingent or otherwise) to acquire the
same.   Section 3.2 Capital Stock.   (a) The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company
Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof, (i) 23,120,291 shares of Company
Common Stock are issued and outstanding; (ii) 1,203,375 shares of Company
Common Stock are subject to outstanding options issued, and 102,560 shares of
Company Stock have been granted as deferred stock awards, under the
Company\'s 1993 Stock Incentive Plan or 1998 Stock Incentive Plan; (iii)
1,585,900 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and held in the treasury
of the Company; and (v) no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued,
outstanding or reserved for issuance. Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the date
hereof, of all holders of options, deferred stock awards,
directors\' restricted stock or other rights to purchase or receive capital
stock of the Company under a stock option or other stock based employee or
non-employee director benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including such person\'s name, the number of options (vested, unvested and
total) or other rights held by such person, the date of grant and the
exercise price for each such option or right.   (b) All the outstanding
Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Except as set forth in paragraph (a) above, and except for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) there are no shares of capital stock of
the Company authorized, issued or outstanding, (ii) there are no authorized
or outstanding options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights, subscriptions or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell
or cause to be issued, transferred or sold any Shares or other capital stock
or other equity interest in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other
right, agreement, arrangement or commitment, and (iii) there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or other capital stock
or other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
provide funds to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any Subsidiary (other than a   
21    Subsidiary that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the
entity obligated to provide such funds) or other entity.   Section 3.3
Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation.   (a) The
Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company and, except for obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the
filing of the Certificate of Merger or the Certificate of Ownership and
Merger, as applicable, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company approved for
purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL the execution and delivery by DCNA, the
Purchaser and the Company of this Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement
by DCNA and DDC Holdings and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and has taken all appropriate action so that
Section 203 of the DGCL, with respect to the Company, will not be applicable
to DCNA and the Purchaser by virtue of such actions or otherwise. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of DCNA and the Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and
the availability of equitable relief.   (b) Except for the filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals set forth in Section 3.3(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Exchange Act, the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), state
securities or blue sky laws, the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange or the anti-competition laws or regulations of the European Union or
any other foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or DCAG (directly or
through Subsidiaries, in each case ) has material assets or conducts material
operations, and the filing of the Certificate of Merger or Certificate of
Ownership and Merger, as applicable, under the DGCL, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions hereof will (i) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) require any filing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with, or
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any federal, regional, state
or local court, arbitrator, tribunal, administrative    22    agency or
commission or other governmental or other regulatory authority or agency,
whether U.S. or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), (iii) result in
a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound (the "Company Agreements"), or (iv) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, permit, license, ordinance,
law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, excluding from the
foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) such filings, permits, authorizations,
consents, approvals, violations, breaches or defaults which will not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or prevent or substantially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.4 Reports and Financial
Statements. The Company has previously furnished or otherwise made available
(by electronic filing or otherwise) to DCNA true and complete copies of:  
(a) the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1999;   (b) the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
filed by the Company with the SEC for the quarter ended March 31, 2000;  
(c) each definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC since
December 31, 1998;   (d) each final prospectus filed by the Company
with the SEC since December 31, 1998; and   (e) all Current Reports on Form
8-K filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1999.  As of their
respective dates, such reports, proxy statements and prospectuses filed by
the Company (collectively with, and giving effect to, any
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC Reports") (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations   23    promulgated
thereunder in effect as of the date of filing, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except
to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC Report
was amended or was superseded by a later filed Company SEC Report, none of
the Company SEC Reports contained, as of the date the Company SEC Report was
filed with the SEC, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. The
audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash
flows for the periods or as of the dates then ended (subject, in the case of
the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end
adjustments), and in each case were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") consistently
applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise disclosed in the
notes thereto). Since January 1, 1999, the Company has timely filed all
reports, registration statements and other filings required to be filed by it
with the SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC. As of the respective
dates thereof, all reports of the type referred to in this Section 3.4 which
the Company files with the SEC on or after the date hereof, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements included in such reports (including
any related notes and schedules) will fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash
flows or other information included therein for the periods or as of the date
then ended (subject, in the case of the interim financial statements, to
normal, recurring year- end adjustments), and will be prepared in each case
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved
(except as otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto).   Section 3.5 No
Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature required to be set forth in a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries    24    under GAAP, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, and there is no existing condition, situation or set of
circumstances which could be expected to result in such a liability or
obligation, except liabilities or obligations (a) reflected in the Company
SEC Reports or (b) which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.6 No Violation of Law.
The businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, permit, license,
ordinance, law, statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
(provided that no representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.6 with
respect to Environmental Laws), except (a) as described in the Company SEC
Reports, and (b) for violations or possible violations which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   Section 3.7 Environmental Matters.   (a) Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has obtained all licenses, permits, authorizations,
approvals and consents from Governmental Entities which are required under
any applicable Environmental Law and necessary for its operations as now
conducted ("Environmental Permits"), except for such failures to have
Environmental Permits which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of such Environmental Permits
is in full force and effect, and each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Environmental Permits
and with all applicable Environmental Laws, except for such failures to be in
full force and effect or in compliance which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (b)
There are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to
the best knowledge of the Company, for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is liable, that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (c) There are no past or present
actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents,
including, without limitation, the release, threatened release or presence of
any Hazardous Material, that would form the basis of any Environmental Claim
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is liable, except for such  
25    Environmental Claims which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (d) No site or
facility now or previously owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is listed or proposed for listing on the National Priorities
List promulgated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("CERCLA"), except for those sites or facilities
listed in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (e) No Liens
have arisen under or pursuant to any Environmental Law on any site or
facility owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and no action of any Governmental Entity has
been taken or, to the knowledge of the Company, is in process which will
subject any of such properties to such Liens, except for any such action
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.   (f) Notwithstanding any other representation
and warranty in this Article III, the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 3.7 constitute the sole representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to any Environmental Law,
Environmental Permit or Hazardous Material.   (g) As used in this
Agreement:   (i) "Environmental Claim" means any claim,  action, lawsuit or
proceeding by any Person which seeks to impose  liability (including, without
limitation, liability for investigatory  costs, cleanup costs, governmental
response costs, natural resources,  damages, property damages, personal
injuries or penalties) arising out  of, based on or resulting from (A) the
presence, or release or  threatened release, of any Hazardous Materials at
any location, whether  or not owned or operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or  (B) circumstances which would give rise to any violation,
or alleged  violation, of any Environmental Law.   (ii) "Environmental Law"
means any law or order  of any Governmental Entity relating to (A) the
generation, treatment,  storage, disposal, use, handling, manufacturing,
transportation or  shipment of Hazardous Materials or (B) the protection of
the  environment or to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened 
releases of Hazardous Material into the environment.   (iii) "Hazardous
Materials" means (A) any  petroleum   26   or petroleum products,
radioactive materials or friable asbestos; (B)  any chemicals or other
materials or substances which are now defined as  or included in the
definition of "hazardous substances," "hazardous  wastes," "hazardous
materials," "extremely hazardous wastes,"  "restricted hazardous wastes,"
"toxic substances," "toxic pollutants,"  "pollutants," contaminants,"
"infectious wastes," "hazardous chemicals"  or "hazardous pollutants," under
any Environmental Law; and (C)  pesticides.   Section 3.8 Employee Benefit
Plans; ERISA.   (a) Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete list of each material deferred
compensation, incentive compensation or equity compensation plan; "welfare"
plan, fund or program (within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")); "pension"
plan, fund or program (within the meaning of section 3(2) of ERISA); each
material employment, consulting, termination or severance agreement; and each
other material employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or
arrangement, in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Company or by any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of section
4001(b) of ERISA, or to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is party, for
the benefit of any employee or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary (the "Company Plans"). The Company shall deliver a true and
complete list of Company Plans that are maintained outside of the United
States primarily for the benefit of persons who are not citizens or residents
of the United States "(Foreign Plans") to Purchaser as soon as practicable
after the date hereof. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any
material liabilities or obligations with respect to Foreign Plans (whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise) which are not reflected in the
Company SEC Reports to the extent required to be so reflected.   (b) With
respect to each Company Plan, the Company has heretofore delivered or made
available to DCNA true and complete copies of the Company Plans and any
amendments thereto, any related trust or other funding vehicle, the most
recent reports or summaries required under ERISA or the Code and the most
recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") with respect to each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section
401 of the Code.   (c) No liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA
has    27    been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that
has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a
material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such
liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due), except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (d) No Company Plan that
is subject to Title IV (a "Company Title IV Plan") is a "multiemployer
pension plan," as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Company Title
IV Plan a plan described in section 4063(a) of ERISA.   (e) Except as
disclosed on Section 3.8(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect
to each Company Title IV Plan, the present value of all "benefit liabilities"
within the meaning of section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA under such plan, based
upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent
actuarial report prepared by such plan\'s actuary with respect to such plan
did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value of
the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.   (f) All
contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Plan on or
prior to the Closing Date have been timely made. Since January 1, 2000, there
has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether
or not written) by the Company or any Subsidiary relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Plan above the
level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof.   (g) Each Company Plan has been operated
and administered in accordance with its terms and applicable law, including
but not limited to ERISA and the Code, except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and each Company Plan intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under section
501(a) of the Code, except for failures to so qualify or be exempt that would
reasonably be expected to be curable without a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.8(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Company Plan provides medical,
surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured)
for employees or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary for
periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits under
any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
current or former employee (or his beneficiary).     28   (i) Section
3.8(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Company Plan
under which payments may be made that could constitute "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The aggregate
amount of such excess parachute payments (exclusive of "gross-up payments"
for excise tax) shall not exceed the amount set forth in Section 3.8(i)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (j) Section 3.8(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Company Plan under which, as a result of
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, either alone or in combination
with another event, (A) any current or former employee or officer of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate may become entitled to severance pay or any
other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (B)
compensation due any such employee or officer may become vested or increased
or the time of payment accelerated.   (k) There are no pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by or on behalf of any
employee or beneficiary covered under any such Company Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits),
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (l)
There are no pending or scheduled audits of any Company Plan by any
Governmental Entity or any pending nor, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims or penalties resulting from any such audit, except as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.9 Absence of
Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports,
since December 31, 1999 (a) the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course, and (b) there has not been any event, occurrence, development or
state of circumstances or facts that has had, or would have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.10
Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports and in Section
3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no claims, actions, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations or investigations pending (or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, threatened) against or affecting the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets at law or in
equity, by or before any Governmental Entity which, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a    29    Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or would prevent or substantially delay the Offer or the Merger.   Section
3.11 Schedule 14D-9; Offer Documents; and Proxy Statement. Neither the
Schedule 14D-9 nor any information supplied by the Company for inclusion in
the Offer Documents will, at the respective times the Schedule 14D-9, the
Offer Documents or any amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the
SEC or are first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

Option, and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Employee Stock Option. The Company shall give an explicit notice of the
cancellation of the Employee Stock Options at the Effective Time to each
holder thereof at least seven days prior to the Effective Time. All payments
in respect of such Employee Stock Options shall be made as promptly as
practicable after the earlier of the purchase of Shares pursuant to  
42    the Offer and the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Agreement (the "Purchase Date"), subject to the collection of all applicable
withholding Taxes required by law to be collected by the Company. Prior to
the Purchase Date, the Company and DCNA shall take all action as may be
necessary to carry out the terms of this Section 5.5.   (b) Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, units credited to deferred compensation
accounts, maintained under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and
the Deferred Compensation Plan for Senior Management (the "Deferred
Compensation Plans") which are deemed invested in shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed settled for a cash amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the Offer Price and (y) the number of units of Company
Common Stock credited to each such account. Any such amount (and any other
cash amounts credited to accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plans),
shall continue to be governed by the terms of the applicable plan, as may be
amended from time to time.   (c) For the period from the Purchase Date
through December 31, 2001, DCNA shall, or shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements which are, in the aggregate, for the employees who were
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior
to the Purchase Date and continue to be employees of DCNA, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of DCNA, no less favorable than those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Purchase Date; and
more specifically DCNA agrees to continue to use the current methodology for
determining the lump sum payout of benefits to former General Motors salaried
employees under the Company\'s defined benefit pension plan. Each person who
is an employee or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Purchase Date (a "Company Employee") shall, without
duplication of benefits, be given credit for all service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (and service credited by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) prior to the Purchase Date, using the same methodology utilized
by the Company as of immediately before the Purchase Date for crediting
service and determining levels of benefits, under (i) all employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by DCNA and
its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation) in which such Company Employees become
participants for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determination of level of benefits (excluding, however, benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plans), and (ii) severance plans for purposes of
calculating the amount of each Company Employee\'s severance benefits. DCNA,
the Company and the Surviving Company    43    shall (x) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company
Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such Company Employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Purchase Date, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Purchase Date under any welfare
benefit plan maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Purchase Date, and (y) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Purchase Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans
that such Company Employees are eligible to participate in after the Purchase
Date.   Section 5.6 Takeover Statute. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company, DCNA and the Purchaser and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 5.7 No Solicitation by the Company.   (a) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of any of them
shall, and the Company shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives,
including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries (the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives being the "Company
Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries
(by way of furnishing information or otherwise) or the making of any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person which constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
(or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company\'s Board of Directors may, or
may authorize the Company Representatives to, in response to an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith
is an Incipient Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person making such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, provided that, prior to taking any such action, the Company
provides reasonable advance notice to DCNA that it is taking such action. For
purposes of this Agreement "Acquisition Proposal" means any direct or
indirect inquiry, proposal or   44    offer (or any improvement,
restatement, amendment, renewal or reiteration thereof) relating to the
acquisition or purchase of a business or shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction (a "Business Combination Transaction") involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any purchase or sale of a substantial portion of
the consolidated assets (including without limitation stock of Subsidiaries
owned directly or indirectly by the Company) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (an "Asset Transaction"), other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as permitted by Section 5.1 of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Incipient Superior
Proposal" shall mean an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after
consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor) would, if consummated,
provide greater aggregate value to the Company\'s stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that for purposes of this definition the term "Acquisition Proposal"
shall have the meaning set forth above, except that (x) references to "shares
of any class of equity securities of the Company" shall be deemed to be
references to "100% of the outstanding Shares" and (y) an "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to refer only to a Business Combination Transaction
involving the Company or, with respect to an Asset Transaction,
such transaction must involve the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and not any Subsidiary of the Company alone and (B)
"Superior Proposal" shall mean an Incipient Superior Proposal for which any
required financing is committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors in the Company (after consultation with its financial
advisor), is capable of being financed by the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal.   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.7, neither
the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or change, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify
or change, in a manner adverse to DCNA, the recommendation by such Board
of Directors or such committee of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement
unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, that the Offer, the
Merger or this Agreement is no longer in the best interests of the Company\'s
stockholders and that such withdrawal, modification or change is, therefore,
required in order to satisfy its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
stockholders under applicable law, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to   45    approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal, (x) take
any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) above or (y) subject to
this paragraph (b), terminate this Agreement (and concurrently with or after
such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal) but only
after the third business day following DCNA\'s receipt of written notice
advising DCNA that the Company\'s Board of Directors is prepared to accept an
Acquisition Proposal, and attaching the most current version of any such
Acquisition Proposal or any draft of an Acquisition Agreement; provided, the
Company is not in breach of any of its obligations under this Section
5.7.   (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.7, the Company shall promptly (but
in any event within one business day) notify DCNA orally and in writing
of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the substance of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company thereafter shall keep
DCNA reasonably informed of the status and terms (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposals or inquiries and the
status of any discussions or negotiations relating thereto.   (d) Nothing
contained in this Section 5.7 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of
Directors from at any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders required by
applicable law.   Section 5.8 Public Announcements. DCNA and the Company
agree that neither one of them will issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior approval of the other party (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which such
party\'s securities are listed.   Section 5.9 Indemnification; Insurance.
(a) From and after the Purchase Date, DCNA will indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former   46  director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses") incurred
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action"), by
reason of the fact that such individual is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, arising out of or pertaining to or
incurred in connection with acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions,
by any of them in their capacity as such whether commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the purchase of Shares in the Offer and including,
without limitation, any Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated
hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, and DCNA shall
also advance fees and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. DCNA shall be entitled to
control the defense of any Action with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in the defense thereof; provided, however, that DCNA shall
not settle or compromise any Action without the Indemnified Party\'s written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
(b) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall, from and after the
Purchase Date, and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall, from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth as of the
date of this Agreement in Section 6 of the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Purchase Date in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the
Purchase Date were directors, officers or employees of the Company;
provided that nothing contained herein shall limit DCNA\'s ability to merge
the Company into DCNA or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise eliminate the
Company\'s corporate existence; and provided further that in the event of a
merger in which the Company is not the Surviving Corporation, the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall contain indemnity
provisions substantially identical to Section 6 of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to, or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors or employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such   
47    policies.   (d) For six years from the Effective Time, DCNA
shall maintain in effect the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (the "Policies")
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Policies; provided,
however, that in no event shall DCNA be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
and its Subsidiaries for such insurance, and, provided, further, that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, DCNA shall be
obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount; and provided, further, that DCNA may meet its
obligations under this paragraph by covering the above persons under either
DCAG\'s or DCNA\'s insurance policy on the terms described above that
expressly provided coverage for any acts which are covered by the existing
policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   (e) The rights of each
Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws
of the Company or any Subsidiary, under the DGCL or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
otherwise, the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Indemnified
Party shall, for all purposes, be a third party beneficiary of the covenants
and agreements of the Company contained in this Section 5.9 and, accordingly,
shall be treated as a party to this Agreement for purposes of the rights and
remedies relating to enforcement of such covenants and agreements and shall
be entitled to enforce any such rights and exercise any such
remedies directly.   Section 5.10 Disclosure Schedule Supplements. From
time to time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will promptly supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing or
occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in a schedule or in any representation
and warranty of the Company which has been rendered inaccurate thereby in any
material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Company shall not
supplement or amend Section 5.1(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement in order to determine the fulfillment
of the conditions set forth in clause (e) of Annex A, the Company  
48    Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to include only that information
contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to
exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or amendment
thereto.   Section 5.11 Shared Corporate Services. The Company shall
not amend the terms of the Management Services Agreement, dated the date of
this Agreement, between the Company and Penske. Except as expressly provided
in the Management Services Agreement, within 90 days following the Effective
Time the Company shall cease using services provided by or procured by Penske
or DDC Holdings and shall cease to be obligated to compensate either such
party for such services, and to the extent that Penske or DDC Holdings use
services provided by the Company, such services shall also cease and Penske
and DDC Holdings shall no longer be obligated to accept or pay for such
services within 90 days following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time the Company, the Purchaser and DCNA shall use reasonable best efforts to
develop and implement plans that will permit the separation of the Company
from Penske and DDC Holdings and will permit separation of corporate services
currently shared by such parties, particularly those such as insurance, MIS,
public accounting and other similar services provided by third party
suppliers, on an expeditious, cost-efficient and harmonious basis, including
through the provision of services by one party to the other for an
appropriate and mutually agreeable transition period on an arm\'s-length
basis. Following the Effective Time the parties will use their reasonable
best efforts to implement such plan.    ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE
MERGER   Section 6.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger

illegal.   (c) DCNA or the Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them
shall have purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer or pursuant to
the Stock   49    Purchase Agreement, except that this condition shall

Merger if DCNA, the Purchaser or such affiliate shall have failed to purchase
Shares pursuant to the Offer in breach of their obligations under this
Agreement.   (d) The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated, and the applicable waiting period under the

this Agreement or the Offer has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Shares to have been purchased pursuant to the Offer; (ii) a
statute, rule, regulation or executive or court order shall have been
enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced prohibiting the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger substantially on the terms contemplated hereby or
otherwise making the acquisition of Shares by DCNA or the Purchaser or any
affiliate of either of them illegal; or (iii) an order, decree, ruling or
injunction shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
substantially on the terms contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling

Purchaser shall have (i) failed to commence the Offer within 20 days
following the date of this Agreement, or (ii) terminated the Offer without

failed to commence the Offer within 20 days following the date of this
Agreement, or (ii) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares
for payment thereunder;   (e) by the Company, in accordance with
Section 5.7(b); provided, that such termination shall not be effective unless
and until the Company shall have paid to DCNA the fee described in Section
7.3 hereof and shall have complied with the provisions of Sections 5.7(b) and
(c).   Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect (except for
the provisions of Sections 5.2, 7.3 and 8.2 in the case of termination of
this Agreement at any time, and Section 5.5 in the case of a termination
following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer), and there shall be
no other liability on the part of DCNA, the Purchaser or the Company or their
respective officers or directors except liability arising out of a willful
breach of this Agreement. In the event of termination of this Agreement

Purchaser will promptly terminate the Offer upon such termination of this
Agreement without the purchase of Shares thereunder.   Section 7.3

Company shall immediately pay DCNA a fee equal to $3 million (the
"Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds,

Company acknowledges    51    that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, DCNA and the Purchaser would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such
payment, DCNA commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay to

provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Offer, any of the following conditions shall exist:   (a) there shall have
been entered, enforced or issued by any Governmental Entity, any judgment,
order, injunction or decree (i) which makes illegal, restrains or prohibits
the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, any Shares by DCNA, the
Purchaser or any other affiliate of DCNA, or the consummation of the Merger
transaction; (ii) which prohibits or limits materially the ownership or
operation by the Company, DCNA or any of their Subsidiaries of all or any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company, DCNA or any of
their Subsidiaries, or compels the Company, DCNA or any of their Subsidiaries
to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the business or assets
of the Company, DCNA or any of their Subsidiaries; (iii) which imposes or
confirms limitations on the ability of DCNA, the Purchaser or any other

Material Adverse Effect on the Company to the extent that it relates to or
arises out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or DCNA;  
(b) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation,   
58   legislation or interpretation enacted, enforced, promulgated, amended
or issued by any Governmental Entity or deemed by any Governmental Entity
applicable to (i) DCNA, the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of DCNA or
the Company or (ii) any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, other
than the HSR Act and the EU Council Regulation 4064/89, as amended, which is
reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a)
above;   (c) there shall have occurred any changes, conditions, events or
developments that would have, or be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;   (d) the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have (i)
withdrawn, modified or changed, in a manner adverse to DCNA or the Purchaser,
the recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Offer,
the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approved or recommended, or proposed
publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) caused the
Company to enter into any Acquisition Agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) resolved to do any of the foregoing;   (e) the
representations or warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement that
are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and
correct, or the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the Agreement that are not so qualified shall not be true and correct in all
material respects, in each case, as if such representations or warranties
were made as of such time on or after the date of the Agreement (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of a specific date or
as of the date of the Agreement, in which case such representations and
warranties shall not be so true and correct or true and correct in all
material respects, as the case may be, as of such specific date or as of the
date of the Agreement, respectively);   (f) the Company shall have failed to

otherwise modified;   (h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in   
59  accordance with its terms; or   (i) the Purchaser and the Company
shall have agreed that the Purchaser shall terminate the Offer;  which, in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the Purchaser in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by DCNA
or any of its affiliates) giving rise to any such condition makes it
inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment.   The
foregoing conditions are for the benefit of the Purchaser and DCNA and,
subject to applicable provisions of the Agreement, may be asserted by the
Purchaser or DCNA regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any
such condition or may be waived by the Purchaser or DCNA in whole or in part
at any time and from time to time in their reasonable discretion. The failure
by DCNA or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.     '
