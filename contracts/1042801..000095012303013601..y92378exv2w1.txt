OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November
24, 2003 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time,
this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between INDEPENDENCE COMMUNITY BANK
CORP., a Delaware corporation ("ICBC") and STATEN ISLAND BANCORP, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("SIB").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors
of each of ICBC and SIB have determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which SIB would merge with and
into ICBC (the "Merger"), and immediately thereafter SI Bank and Trust
("SIBT"), a wholly owned subsidiary of SIB, would be merged with and into
Independence Community Bank ("Independence Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary
of ICBC (the "Savings Bank Merger"); and   WHEREAS, it is the intention of
the parties to this Agreement that the Merger be treated as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and this Agreement shall constitute a
plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),
SIB shall merge with and into ICBC. ICBC shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Company") in the Merger,
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The name of the Surviving Company shall be Independence Community
Bank Corp. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of SIB shall terminate.   1.2. Effective Time. The Merger shall become
effective as set forth in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). The term "Effective
Time" shall mean the time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in
the Certificate of Merger.   1.3. Effects of the Merger. At and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and the DGCL.   1.4. Closing of the Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the date that is the second Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of
the  conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, other than conditions
which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, or such other date or
time as the parties may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed upon in
writing by the parties. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day"
shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which
banking organizations in the City of New York are required or authorized by
law to be closed.   1.5. Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of ICBC, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Company.   1.6. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
ICBC, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Company.   1.7. Board of Directors. Subject to
Section 7.14, the directors of ICBC immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue to be the directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.   ARTICLE II  CONSIDERATION;
EXCHANGE PROCEDURES   2.1. Conversion of SIB Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger:   (a) All shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of SIB (the "SIB Common Stock") that are (i) owned directly
by SIB as treasury stock, (ii) unallocated shares of SIB Common Stock held in
its Amended and Restated 1998 Recognition and Retention Plan and Trust
Agreement (the "SIB Recognition Plan") or (iii) owned directly by ICBC (other
than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit
of customers or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted)
shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of ICBC ("ICBC Common Stock"), or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) Each outstanding share of SIB Common
Stock that under the terms of Section 2.3 is to be converted into the right
to receive shares of ICBC Common Stock shall, subject to Section 2.4, be
converted into and become the right to receive a number of shares of ICBC
Common Stock equal to the Cash Election Price (as hereinafter defined)
divided by the Average Market Price (such quotient, the "Exchange Ratio").
For purposes of this Agreement, the "Average Market Price" shall mean the
average of the closing prices of shares of ICBC Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the ten
consecutive full trading days (the "Valuation Period") ending on the tenth
Business Day prior to the Closing Date (for the sake of clarity, such tenth
Business Day shall be considered the last full trading day included within
the Valuation Period). The Average Market Price shall be   -2-  calculated
to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent and the Exchange Ratio shall be
calculated to the nearest ten thousandth.   (c) Each outstanding share of
SIB Common Stock that under the terms of Section 2.3 is to be converted into
the right to receive cash shall be converted into the right to receive the
sum of (x) 0.7500 times 0.6232 times the Average Market Price and (y) 0.2500
times $23.8810 (such sum, the "Cash Election Price").   (d) Each
outstanding share of SIB Common Stock held by a holder who has perfected such
holder\'s right to dissent under the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive shares of ICBC Common
Stock or cash hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted pursuant to the DGCL. SIB shall give ICBC prompt
notice upon receipt by SIB of any such demands for payment of the fair value
of such shares of SIB Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any
other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly
making such demand being hereinafter referred to as a
"Dissenting Shareholder"), and ICBC shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. SIB shall
not, except with the prior written consent of ICBC, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as
may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving
Company.   (e) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s right to such
payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such holder\'s shares of SIB
Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive cash or ICBC Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If such holder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such holder\'s right to such payment after the Effective Time, each share of
SIB Common Stock of such holder shall be converted on a share-by-share basis
into either the right to receive the Cash Election Price or ICBC Common Stock
as ICBC shall determine in its sole discretion.   (f) The Exchange Ratio
set forth above shall be subject to appropriate adjustments in the event
that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding ICBC Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities through any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other like changes in
ICBC\'s capitalization.   2.2. Election Procedures. (a) Each person who, as
of three Business Days prior to the date on which the Election Form (as
hereinafter defined) is mailed pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof (the "Election
Form Record Date"), is a record holder of shares of SIB Common Stock shall
have the right to submit an Election Form specifying the number of shares of
SIB Common Stock that such person desires to have converted into the right to
receive ICBC Common Stock (a "Stock Election"), and the number of shares of
SIB Common Stock that such person desires to have converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price (a "Cash Election"). Any such record holder
who fails properly to submit an Election Form on or before the Election
Deadline   -3-  (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 3.2 or shall have acquired shares of SIB Common Stock
after the Secondary Election Form Record Date (defined below) shall be deemed
to have made a Stock Election. Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed SIB Cash
Election Shares (as hereinafter defined), and with respect to such shares the
holders thereof shall in no event receive consideration comprised of ICBC
Common Stock. Any election to receive ICBC Common Stock or cash shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined) shall
have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline, and, in accordance with Section 3.2, any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent.   (b) The Exchange
Agent shall make available an additional Election Form to all persons who
become record holders of SIB Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the
Election Deadline (the "Secondary Election Form Record Date").   2.3.
Proration. Within five Business Days after the Election Deadline, the
Exchange Agent shall calculate the allocation among holders of SIB
Common Stock of rights to receive ICBC Common Stock or cash in the Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows (the consideration provided for
in this Section 2.3, together with the consideration provided for in Section
2.4, is referred to as the "Merger Consideration"):   (a) In the event the
aggregate number of shares of SIB Common Stock in respect of which Cash
Elections shall have been made (the "SIB Cash Election Shares") is greater
than the quotient of (x) $368,500,000 divided by (y) the Cash Election Price
(such quotient, the "Cash Conversion Shares"), then:   (i) all shares of SIB
Common Stock in respect of which Stock  Elections have been made will be
converted into the right to receive ICBC  Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of Section 2.1(b); and   (ii) all shares of SIB Common Stock in
respect of which Cash  Elections have been made will be converted into the
right to receive ICBC  Common Stock and cash in the following manner:   (A)
a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor") shall be  determined by
dividing (x) $368,500,000 by (y) the product of the  SIB Cash Election Shares
and the Cash Election Price;   (B) the number of SIB Cash Election Shares
held by each holder  of shares of SIB Common Stock that will be converted
into the right  to receive cash pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1(c) shall
be  determined by multiplying the Cash Proration Factor by the number of 
SIB Cash Election Shares held by such holder; and   (C) all SIB Cash
Election Shares other than those shares  converted into the right to receive
cash in accordance with the  preceding subparagraph (B) shall be converted
into the right to  receive ICBC Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
Section  2.1(b); or   -4-   (b) In the event the aggregate number of SIB
Cash Election Shares is less than the Cash Conversion Shares, then:   (i)
all SIB Cash Election Shares (subject to the provisions of  Section 2.1(d)
with respect to any Dissenting Shares) will be converted  into the right to
receive cash in accordance with the terms of Section  2.1(c); and   (ii)
all shares of SIB Common Stock in respect of which Stock  Elections shall
have been made (the "SIB Stock Election Shares") will be  converted into the
right to receive ICBC Common Stock and cash in the  following manner:   (A)
a proration factor (the "Stock Proration Factor") shall be  determined by
dividing the Stock Conversion Shares (defined below)  by the aggregate number
of SIB Stock Election Shares. The "Stock  Conversion Shares" shall mean the
difference between (x) the total  number of shares of SIB Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time and (y) the Cash
Conversion Shares;   (B) the number of SIB Stock Election Shares held by
each  holder of shares of SIB Common Stock that will be converted into the 
right to receive shares of ICBC Common Stock pursuant to the terms  of
Section 2.1(b) shall be determined by multiplying the Stock  Proration Factor
by the number of SIB Stock Election Shares held by  such holder; and   (C)
all SIB Stock Election Shares other than those shares  converted into the
right to receive ICBC Common Stock in accordance  with the preceding
subparagraph (B) shall be converted into the  right to receive cash in
accordance with the terms of Section  2.1(c); or   (c) If the number of SIB
Stock Election Shares is equal to the number of Stock Conversion Shares and
the number of SIB Cash Election Shares is equal to the number of Cash
Conversion Shares, then subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.3 shall
not apply and all SIB Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right
to receive ICBC Common Stock and all SIB Cash Election Shares (subject to the
provisions of Section 2.1(d)) will be converted into the right to receive
cash.   2.4. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of ICBC
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of SIB Common Stock
who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of ICBC
Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of
SIB Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the ICBC
Share Price. The "ICBC Share Price" shall mean the average of the closing
sale prices of one share of ICBC Common Stock for the five trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date on the Nasdaq National Market as
reported by The Wall Street Journal. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.   -5-   2.5. ICBC Common Stock; ICBC Preferred Stock. At and after
the Effective Time, each share of ICBC Common Stock and each share of any
preferred stock of ICBC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock
or preferred stock, as the case may be, of ICBC and shall not be affected by
the Merger. Each share of ICBC Common Stock owned by SIB immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become treasury stock of ICBC at the Effective
Time.   2.6. Options; Restricted Share Units. (a) At the Effective Time,
each option granted by SIB to purchase shares of SIB Common Stock (each, an
"SIB Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto,
whether vested or unvested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of SIB Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the SIB Option,
that number of shares of ICBC Common Stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of SIB Common Stock subject to such SIB Option by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of SIB
Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a
cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such SIB Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any SIB
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of
shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.   (b) Within ten Business Days
after the Effective Time, ICBC shall file a registration statement on Form
S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of ICBC Common Stock subject to the
options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.6 and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain outstanding
in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form S-3, until the shares
subject to such options may be sold without a further holding period under
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (as hereinafter defined).   (c) At the
Effective Time, each award to receive a distribution of SIB Common Stock
granted by SIB (collectively, the "SIB Restricted Stock") which is unvested
and outstanding immediately prior to date of this Agreement and set forth in
Section 2.6(c) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule (as hereinafter defined) shall
vest and become free of any restrictions to which they are subject under the
SIB Recognition Plan.   2.7. Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. ICBC
may at any time change the method of effecting the business combination
contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a
change to be desirable, including to provide for a merger of SIB with and
into a direct wholly owned corporate subsidiary of ICBC or a single member
limited liability company wholly owned by ICBC; provided, however, that no
such change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration, (B) adversely affect the anticipated tax consequences of the
Merger to the holders of SIB Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger
Consideration, or (C) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger.
In the event ICBC elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.   -6-   ARTICLE III 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION   3.1. ICBC to Make Merger
Consideration Available. ICBC shall appoint an agent, who shall be reasonably
acceptable to SIB (the "Exchange Agent"), for the purpose of exchanging
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of
SIB Common Stock (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. At or
promptly after the Effective Time, ICBC shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates
representing the shares of ICBC Common Stock and an estimated amount of cash
sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.4 (such cash
and certificates for shares of ICBC Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.1 shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by ICBC.  
3.2. Election Form. No later than fifteen Business Days prior to the expected
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of SIB
Common Stock on the Election Form Record Date (or, in the case of
those persons specified in Section 2.2(b), no later than the fifth Business
Day prior to the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of SIB Common Stock on the Secondary Election Form Record
Date) an election form (the "Election Form") providing for such holders to
make the Cash Election and/or the Stock Election; provided, however, that
such Election Form need not be mailed prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (as hereinafter defined). Any election other than a
deemed Stock Election shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall
have received by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a date (the "Election
Deadline") to be decided by ICBC (which date shall not be earlier than
fifteen Business Days after the initial mailing of the Election Form and no
later than the Effective Time), an Election Form properly completed and
executed (with the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed to the extent
required by the Election Form) by such holder accompanied by such holder\'s
Certificates, or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates
from a member of any registered national securities exchange or of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or by a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States as set forth in such Election Form. Any
holder of SIB Common Stock who has made an election by submitting an Election
Form to the Exchange Agent may at any time prior to the Election Deadline
change such holder\'s election by submitting a revised Election Form,
properly completed and signed that is received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline. Any holder of SIB Common Stock may at any time prior
the Election Deadline revoke such holder\'s election and withdraw such
holder\'s Certificates deposited with the Exchange Agent by written notice to
the Exchange Agent received by the close of business on the day prior to
the Election Deadline.   3.3. Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than five Business
Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate who has not previously surrendered such Certificate or
Certificates with the Election Form a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the  
-7-  surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration therefor. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of the Certifications on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates.   (b) No dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to ICBC Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
shares of ICBC Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.4 until such
holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article III.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article III,
such holder thereof entitled to receive ICBC Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, with a record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore
had become payable with respect to whole shares of ICBC Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.   (c) If the payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.   (d) At and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
SIB of the shares of SIB Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.   (e) Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of SIB for six
months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of ICBC, to
ICBC. Any stockholders of SIB who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to ICBC for payment of the Merger
Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions on the ICBC Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of SIB Common Stock held by such
stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of ICBC, SIB, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
SIB Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f)
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or   -8-  destroyed and, if required by
ICBC, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as ICBC may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.  
(g) ICBC or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of SIB Common Stock such amounts as ICBC or the Exchange Agent are required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any applicable provision of any other U.S. federal, state, local
or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
ICBC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the SIB
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
ICBC or the Exchange Agent.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF SIB   As of the date hereof, SIB has delivered to ICBC a schedule
(the "SIB Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, certain
items, the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response
to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article
IV or to one or more covenants contained in Article VI; provided, however,
that (i) no such item is required to be set forth in the SIB Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by Section 8.2(a), and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the SIB Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by SIB that such
item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that
such item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect (as hereinafter defined) on SIB.   SIB hereby represents and warrants
to ICBC as follows:   4.1. Corporate Organization.   (a) SIB is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. SIB has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not have nor reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on SIB. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to SIB,
ICBC or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, a material adverse effect
on the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or a material adverse effect on such
party\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
a timely basis; provided, however, that in determining   -9-  whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on
the referenced party the cause of which is (i) any change after the date of
this Agreement in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability
or published interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities or
in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory
accounting requirements, in any such case applicable to banks, savings banks,
mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, savings associations or their holding
companies generally, (ii) the announcement of this Agreement or any action of
either party or any Subsidiary (defined in Section 4.1(b)) thereof required
to be taken by it under this Agreement or with the prior written consent of
the other party, (iii) any changes after the date of this Agreement in
general economic conditions or interest rates affecting banks, savings banks,
mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, savings associations or their holding
companies generally, (iv) the result of activities (including mortgage loan
originations) at the Mortgage Company (as hereinafter defined) to the extent
such activities are conducted in accordance with the Mortgage Company
Operating Plan (as hereinafter defined) or the Mortgage Company Flow
Agreement (as hereinafter defined) or (v) expenses and costs incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent not
materially in excess of the good faith estimate thereof provided by SIB to
ICBC prior to the date of this Agreement); provided, however, that a decrease
in the trading or market prices of a party\'s capital stock shall not
be considered, by itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect. SIB is
duly registered as a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners\'
Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA"), and qualifies as a savings and loan holding
company of the type described in Section 10(c)(3)(A) of HOLA. The copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of SIB which have previously been
made available to ICBC are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.   (b) Each
Subsidiary of SIB (i) is duly organized and validly existing as a savings
bank, corporation or partnership under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so licensed or qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would have or would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on SIB and
(iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to any person, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company or any other entity (i) of which
such person or a subsidiary of such person is a general partner or (ii) at
least a majority of the securities or other interests of which having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of
Directors or persons performing similar functions with respect to such entity
is directly or indirectly owned by such person and/or one or more
subsidiaries thereof.   (c) Except for its ownership of SIBT, SIB does not
own, either directly or through its Subsidiaries, any stock or equity
interest in any depository institution (as defined in 12 U.S.C. Section
1813(c)(1)). SIBT is a qualified thrift lender pursuant to Section 10(m) of
HOLA and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Bank Insurance Fund (the "BIF") to the
fullest extent permitted by law. SIBT is a member in good standing of the
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of New York.   4.2. Capitalization.  
-10-   (a) The authorized capital stock of SIB consists of
100,000,000 shares of SIB Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred

the date of this Agreement, there were 58,776,874 shares of SIB Common Stock
outstanding (including 4,578,082 unallocated shares of SIB Common Stock held

Common Stock held in the SIB Recognition Plan), no shares of SIB Preferred
Stock outstanding and 31,483,750 shares of SIB Common Stock held in SIB\'s
treasury. No other shares of SIB Common Stock or SIB Preferred Stock were
issued or outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of SIB
Common Stock or SIB Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance, except for an
aggregate of 6,670,278 shares of SIB Common Stock reserved for issuance upon
the exercise of stock options pursuant to the Amended and Restated 1998 Stock
Option Plan (the "SIB Stock Option Plan"). All of the issued and outstanding
shares of SIB Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth above or in Section 4.2(a) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, SIB does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of SIB Common
Stock or SIB Preferred Stock or any other equity securities of SIB or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of SIB capital stock (including any rights plan or agreement). Section 4.2(a)
of the SIB Disclosure Schedule contains a list setting forth as of the date
of this Agreement all outstanding stock options pursuant to the SIB
Stock Option Plan, the names of the optionees, the date each such option was
granted, the number of shares subject to each such option, the expiration
date of each such option, any vesting schedule with respect to an option
which is not yet fully vested, and the price at which each such option may be
exercised.   (b) Section 4.2(b) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule lists the
name, jurisdiction of incorporation, authorized and outstanding shares of
capital stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each
Subsidiary of SIB. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, SIB owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity interests in each
of SIB\'s Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances,
adverse rights or claims and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all
of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither SIB nor any Subsidiary thereof
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase, sale or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any
Subsidiary of SIB or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
any such Subsidiary.   (c) Except as disclosed in Section 4.2(c) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule and for the ownership of SIB\'s Subsidiaries, neither SIB
nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or controls, directly or
indirectly, any shares of stock or other equity interest in any corporation,
firm, partnership, joint venture or other entity, excluding any investments
held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of customers or acquired after
the date of this Agreement in respect of debts previously contracted.  
-11-   (d) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having
the right to vote on any matters on which SIB\'s stockholders may vote
("Voting Debt") have been issued by SIB and are outstanding.   4.3.
Authority; No Violation.   (a) SIB has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required SIB Vote (as hereinafter defined), to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly approved by all necessary corporate and stockholder
action of SIB, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required SIB Vote, and no other corporate
or stockholder proceedings on the part of SIB are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by SIB and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by ICBC) constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of SIB, enforceable against SIB in accordance
with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of
equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by
bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and
remedies generally.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
SIB nor the consummation by SIB of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by SIB with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of SIB or
any of the similar governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 4.4 are duly
obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to SIB or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (y) violate,

benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the

under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which SIB or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
or affected, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults or other events which, either individually or
in the aggregate, will not have and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   4.4. Consents and Approvals. Except for

regulatory organization (each, a "Governmental Entity") or with any other
third party are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery
by SIB of this Agreement and (B) the consummation by SIB of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.   4.5. SEC Documents; Other
Reports; Internal Controls. (a) SIB has filed all required reports,
schedules, registration statements and other documents with the SEC since
December 31, 2000 (the "SIB Reports"). Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of
the SIB Disclosure Schedule, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing), the SIB Reports complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such SIB Reports, and
none of the SIB Reports when filed contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the SIB Reports. None of SIB\'s Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act.   (b) SIB and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since
December 31, 2000 with any Governmental Entity (other than the SEC) and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except
for normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Entity in the regular
course of the business of SIB and its Subsidiaries or as set forth in Section
4.5(b) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, no Governmental Entity has initiated
any proceeding or, to the knowledge of SIB, threatened an investigation into
the business or operations of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries since December
31, 2000. Except as set forth in Section 4.5(b) of the SIB Disclosure
Schedule, there is no material unresolved violation, criticism or exception
by any Governmental Entity with respect to any report, registration or
statement filed by, or relating to any examinations by any such Governmental
Entity of, SIB or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) The records, systems,
controls, data and information of SIB and its Subsidiaries are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are
under the exclusive ownership and direct control of SIB or its Subsidiaries
or accountants (including all   -13-  means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence. As and to the extent described in the SIB Reports filed with the
SEC prior to the date hereof, SIB and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   4.6.
Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 4.6 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, the financial statements of SIB
(including any related notes thereto) included in the SIB Reports complied as
to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of such subsequent filing), in all material respects, with all
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be disclosed therein), and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of SIB and its
consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes
in stockholders\' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and
for the periods shown. The books and records of SIB and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions.   (b) Except for (i) those liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of
SIB included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2003, as filed with the SEC or (ii) liabilities incurred
since September 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued or
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), other than
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement.   4.7. Broker\'s Fees.
Except as set forth in Section 4.7 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, neither
SIB nor any Subsidiary thereof nor any of their respective officers or
directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any
broker\'s fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Copies of all agreements with
each broker or finder listed in Section 4.7 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule
have previously been furnished to ICBC.   4.8. Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Except as publicly disclosed in the SIB Reports filed with the SEC
prior to the date hereof, or as set forth in Section 4.8 of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2003, (i) no event has occurred
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on SIB and (ii) SIB and its Subsidiaries
have not taken any action that would have been prohibited by Section 6.2 if
taken after the date of this Agreement.   4.9. Legal Proceedings. (a) Except
as publicly disclosed in the SIB Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof, neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to the best of SIB\'s knowledge, threatened legal,
administrative, arbitral   -14-  or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against SIB or any of
its Subsidiaries (including under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or any other fair lending law
or other law relating to discriminatory banking practices or the Bank Secrecy
Act) or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as to which there is a reasonable likelihood
of an adverse determination and which, if adversely determined, would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   (b) There is no injunction, order,
judgment, decree or regulatory restriction specifically imposed upon SIB, any
of its Subsidiaries or the assets of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries which has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
SIB or the Surviving Company.   4.10. Taxes.   (a) Except as set forth in
Section 4.10(a) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule: (x) each of SIB and its
Subsidiaries has (i) duly and timely filed (including pursuant to applicable
extensions granted without penalty) all material Tax Returns (as hereinafter
defined) required to be filed by it, and such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all material respects, and (ii) paid in full or made adequate
provision in the financial statements of SIB (in accordance with GAAP) for
all Taxes (as hereinafter defined), whether or not shown as due on such Tax
Returns; (y) no material deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed or
assessed in writing against or with respect to any Taxes due by or Tax
Returns of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries; and (z) there are no material
Liens for Taxes upon the assets of either SIB or its Subsidiaries except for
statutory liens for current Taxes not yet due or Liens for Taxes that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which reserves adequate in accordance with GAAP have been provided.   (b)
Neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is or has ever been a member of
an affiliated group (other than a group the common parent of which is SIB)
filing a consolidated tax return or (B) has any liability for Taxes of any
person arising from the application of Treasury Regulation section

With Applicable Law. (a) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13 of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, SIB and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all
times held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to
all, and have complied with and are not in violation in any material respect

guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to SIB or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT
Act of 2001), except where the failure to hold such license,
franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on SIB, and neither SIB nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violations of any of
the above which, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   -18-

it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee,
agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator
or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing
documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law,
except where the failure to so administer such accounts would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on SIB. None of SIB, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the
knowledge of SIB, any director, officer or employee of SIB or of any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account that would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
SIB, and, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either

of SIB, each of the other parties thereto, has in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each

after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or
default on the part of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
SIB, any other party thereto, under any such SIB Contract, except, in each
case, where such invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to so perform or
breach   -19-  or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.  
(c) Section 4.14(c) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule contains a schedule
showing the present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date
specified in such schedule, whether individually or in the
aggregate (including good faith estimates of all amounts not subject to

Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in
connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (except for such portions thereof as relate only

respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.   4.17. Title to Property.   (a) Real Property.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.17(a) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, SIB

property owned by them free and clear of all Liens, except Liens for current
Taxes not yet due and payable and other standard exceptions commonly found in
title policies in the jurisdiction where such real property is located, and
such encumbrances and imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially
detract from the value of the properties and do not materially interfere with
the present or proposed use of such properties or otherwise materially impair
such operations. All real property and fixtures material to the business,
operations or financial condition of SIB and its Subsidiaries are in good
condition and repair except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.

Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   (c)
Leased Property. All leases of real property and all other leases material to
SIB and its Subsidiaries under which SIB or a Subsidiary, as lessee, leases
personal property are valid and binding in accordance with their respective
terms, there is not under such lease any material existing default by SIB or
such Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of SIB, any other party thereto, or any
event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a
default, and, in the case of leased premises, SIB or such Subsidiary quietly
enjoys the premises provided for in such lease, except in any such case as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   4.18. Insurance. SIB and its Subsidiaries
are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as
the management of SIB reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent
with industry practice. Section 4.18 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule contains
a true and complete list and a brief description (including name of insurer,
agent, coverage and expiration date) of all insurance policies in force on
the date hereof with respect to the business and assets of SIB and its
Subsidiaries (other than insurance policies under which SIB or any Subsidiary
thereof is named as a loss payee, insured or additional insured as a result
of its position as a secured lender on specific loans and mortgage insurance
policies on specific loans or pools of loans). SIB and its Subsidiaries are
in material compliance with their insurance policies and are not in default
under any of the material terms thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and
in full force and effect and, except as set forth in Section 4.18 of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule and except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of SIB and its Subsidiaries,
SIB or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such
policies. All premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been
paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely
fashion.   4.19. Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in Section
4.19 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be
expected to result in the imposition, on SIB or any of its Subsidiaries of
any liability or obligation arising under common law standards relating to
environmental protection, human health or safety, or under any local, state
or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended (collectively, the "Environmental Laws"), pending or, to the
knowledge of SIB, threatened against SIB or any of its Subsidiaries, which
liability or obligation would have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on SIB. To the knowledge of SIB, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would have
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SIB. To
the knowledge of SIB, during or prior to the period of (i) its or any of its
Subsidiaries\' ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, (ii) its or any of its Subsidiaries\' participation in the
management of any property, or (iii) its or any of its Subsidiaries\' holding
of a security interest or other interest in any property,   -21-  there
were no releases or threatened releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or
dangerous materials or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws
in, on, under or affecting any such property which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SIB. Neither SIB nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or
under any Environmental Law that would have or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on SIB.   4.20. Opinion Of Financial
Advisor. SIB has received the opinion of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, dated as of
the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the
consideration to be paid to the stockholders of SIB in the Merger is fair
from a financial point of view to such holders of SIB Common Stock.   4.21.
Patents, Trademarks, Etc. SIB and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses,
or is licensed or otherwise has the right to use, all proprietary rights,
including all trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights, that are
material to the conduct of their existing businesses. Except for
the agreements listed in Section 4.21 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, neither
SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by or a party to any licenses or
agreements of any kind with respect to any trademarks, service marks or trade
names which it claims to own. Neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any communications alleging that any of them has violated any of the
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights or trade secrets
or other proprietary rights of any other person or entity.   4.22. Loan
Matters. (a) (i) Section 4.22(a) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of all extensions of credit (including commitments to extend credit)
("Loans") by SIB and its Subsidiaries to any directors, executive officers
and principal stockholders (as such terms are defined in Regulation
O ("Regulation O") of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) there are no
employee, officer, director or other affiliate Loans on which the borrower is
paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit
agreement or, except for Loans made by SIB and its Subsidiaries to its
employees in accordance with its policies as disclosed in Section 4.22(c) of
the SIB Disclosure Schedule, on which the borrower is paying a rate which was
below market at the time the Loan was made; and (iii) except as listed in
Section 4.22(a) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule, all such Loans are and were
made in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and
regulations.   (b) Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale
to investors) has been solicited and originated and is administered and
serviced, and the relevant Loan files are being maintained, in all material
respects in accordance with the relevant loan documents, SIB\'s underwriting
standards (and, in the case of Loans held for resale to investors, the
underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and with all
applicable requirements of federal, state and local laws, regulations and
rules.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.22(c) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, none of the agreements pursuant to which SIB or any of
its Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans
or pools of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or
interests therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on
any such Loan.   -22-   (d) Each of SIB and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, is approved by and is in good standing: (i) as a supervised
mortgagee by the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to
originate and service Title I FHA mortgage loans; (ii) as a GNMA I and II
Issuer by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"); (iii)
by the Department of Veteran\'s Affairs ("VA") to originate and service VA

Loans.   (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.22(e) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule, none of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it
ever been subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other agreement or
other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan
purchase commitment from, HUD, Ginnie Mae, the VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or
other investor, or any federal or state agency relating to the origination,
sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans. SIB has not received any
notice, nor does it have any reason to believe, that Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac propose to limit or terminate the underwriting authority of SIB and its
Subsidiaries or to increase the guarantee fees payable to such investor.  
(f) Each of SIB and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules
and regulations, including the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act and all HUD, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
other investor and mortgage insurance company requirements relating to the
origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer Loans.   (g) To
the knowledge of SIB, each Loan included in a pool of Loans originated,
acquired or serviced by SIB or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Pool") meets all
eligibility requirements (including all applicable requirements for obtaining
mortgage insurance certificates and loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion
in such Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if required,
recertified in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,
except where the time for certification or recertification has not yet
expired. No Pools have been improperly certified, and no Loan has been bought
out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable investors.  
4.23. Community Reinvestment Act Compliance. SIBT is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, "CRA") and has received a CRA rating of
"outstanding" from the OTS in its most recently completed exam.   4.24.
Labor Matters. Neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is SIB or any of
its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any such
Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel SIB or any such Subsidiary
to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions
of employment, nor is there any strike or other material labor dispute or
disputes involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or to SIB\'s
knowledge, threatened, nor is SIB aware of any activity involving its or any
of its   -23-  Subsidiaries\' employees seeking to certify a collective
bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity.   4.25.
Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not be reasonably
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on SIB, (i) all interest rate swaps, caps, floors and
option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements,
whether entered into for the account of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries or for
the account of a customer of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations
and policies of all applicable Governmental Entities and with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of SIB or one of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge
of SIB, each of the counterparties thereto, and are enforceable in accordance
with their terms, and are in full force and effect, (ii) SIB or its
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of SIB, the counterparties thereto, have
duly performed their obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and (iii) to SIB\'s knowledge, there are
no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by
any party thereunder.   ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
ICBC   As of the date hereof, ICBC has delivered to SIB a schedule

Article V or to one or more covenants contained in Article VI; provided,
however, that (i) no such item is required to be set forth in the ICBC
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 8.3(a),
and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the ICBC Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
ICBC that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or

a Material Adverse Effect on ICBC.   ICBC hereby represents and warrants to
SIB as follows:   5.1. Corporate Organization. (a) ICBC is a corporation

in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC

safety, or under any the Environmental Laws, pending or, to the knowledge of
ICBC, threatened against ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or
obligation would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on ICBC. To the knowledge of ICBC, there is no reasonable
basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation
that would impose any liability or obligation that would have or would

Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or

third party imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or
under any Environmental Law that would have or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on ICBC.   5.18. Opinion Of Financial

Disclosure Schedule, neither ICBC nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by or
a party to any licenses or agreements of any kind with respect to any
trademarks, service marks or trade names which it claims to own. Neither ICBC
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any communications alleging that any
of them has violated any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade
names, copyrights or trade secrets or other proprietary rights of any other
person or entity.   5.20. Loan Matters. (a) Each outstanding loan held by
ICBC (including loans held for resale to investors) has been solicited and
originated and is administered and serviced, and the relevant loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant
loan documents, ICBC\'s underwriting standards (and, in the case of ICBC
Loans held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of
the applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of federal,
state and local laws, regulations and rules.   (b) Except as set forth in
Section 5.20(b) of the ICBC Disclosure Schedule, none of the agreements
pursuant to which ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries has sold loans or pools of
loans or participations in loans or pools of loans contains any obligation to
repurchase such loans or interests therein solely on account of a payment
default by the obligor on any such loan.   (c) Each of ICBC and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, is approved by and is in good standing: (i) as a
supervised mortgagee by HUD to originate and service Title I FHA   
-33-  mortgage loans; (ii) as a GNMA I and II Issuer by Ginnie Mae; (iii) by
the VA to originate and service VA loans; (iv) as a seller/servicer by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac to originate and service conventional residential and
multi-family mortgage loans and (v) as a delegated underwriting and servicing
lender by Fannie Mae.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.20(d) of the
ICBC Disclosure Schedule, none of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries is now nor
has it ever been subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other
agreement or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction
in any loan purchase commitment from, HUD, Ginnie Mae, the VA, Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac or other investor, or any federal or state agency relating to the
origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer loans. ICBC has not
received any notice, nor does it have any reason to believe, that Fannie Mae
or Freddie Mac propose to limit or terminate the underwriting authority of
ICBC and its Subsidiaries or to increase the guarantee fees payable to such
investor.   (e) Each of ICBC and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
rules and regulations, including the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act and all HUD, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
other investor and mortgage insurance company requirements relating to the
origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans.   (f) To
the knowledge of ICBC, each Loan included in a Pool originated, acquired or
serviced by ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries meets all eligibility
requirements (including all applicable requirements for obtaining mortgage
insurance certificates and loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion in such
Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if required, recertified
in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, except where
the time for certification or recertification has not yet expired. No Pools
have been improperly certified, and no loan has been bought out of a Pool
without all required approvals of the applicable investors.   5.21.
Community Reinvestment Act Compliance. Independence Bank is in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the CRA and has
received a CRA rating of "satisfactory" from the FDIC and the New
York Banking Department in its most recently completed exams.    5.22.
Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not be reasonably
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on ICBC, (i) all interest rate swaps, caps, floors and
option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements,
whether entered into for the account of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries or
for the account of a customer of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries, were
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules,
regulations and policies of all applicable Governmental Entities and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of ICBC or one of its Subsidiaries and,
to the knowledge of ICBC, each of the counterparties thereto, and are
enforceable in accordance with their terms, and are in full force and effect,
(ii) ICBC or its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of    -34-  ICBC,
the counterparties thereto, have duly performed their obligations thereunder
to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and (iii) to
ICBC\'s knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults
or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.   ARTICLE

or   (t) agree to, or make any commitment to, take any of the

expressly provided in this Agreement or with the prior written consent of
SIB, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,

required by law or regulation or any Governmental Entity, during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, ICBC shall not, and

stockholders.   (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly

third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to

(including the Merger) and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities.   (c) ICBC and SIB shall, upon request,
furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation
of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 or any other statement,

Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, SIB shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of ICBC access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of SIB and its
Subsidiaries, and, during such period, SIB shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to ICBC (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities laws or
Federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or consumer finance
or protection laws (other than reports or documents which SIB is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as ICBC may reasonably
request. Neither SIB nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or contravene any law, rule or regulation
applicable to the institution in possession or control of such information.
The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply.   (b) ICBC shall hold all information furnished by SIB or any of
its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 7.2(a) in confidence
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 3, 2003, between ICBC and SIB
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").   (c) No investigation by ICBC or its
respective Representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of SIB set forth
herein.   7.3. Stockholder Approval. (a) SIB shall duly take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable following    -40-  the date upon
which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "SIB Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining the Required SIB Vote and, except as provided hereby,
shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by
such stockholders. The Board of Directors of SIB shall recommend adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders
of SIB (the "SIB Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of SIB may (x) withdraw, modify, qualify in any manner adverse to
ICBC, condition or refuse to make such recommendation or (y) take any other
action or make any other public statement in connection with the
SIB Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively,
a "Change in SIB Recommendation") if the Board of Directors of SIB
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would or could
reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary obligations under applicable
law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of SIB at the SIB Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve SIB of such obligation.   (b) ICBC shall duly take all
lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the
Form S-4 becomes effective (the "ICBC Stockholders Meeting" and together with
the SIB Stockholders Meeting, the "Stockholders Meetings") for the purpose of
obtaining the Required ICBC Vote and, except as provided hereby, shall take
all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such
stockholders. The Board of Directors of ICBC shall recommend adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of
ICBC (the "ICBC Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of ICBC may (x) withdraw, modify, qualify in any manner adverse to
SIB, condition or refuse to make such recommendation or (y) take any other
action or make any other public statement in connection with the ICBC
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a
"Change in ICBC Recommendation" and together with a Change in SIB
Recommendation, a "Change in Recommendation") if the Board of Directors
of ICBC determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would or
could reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of ICBC at the ICBC
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve ICBC of such obligation.   (c)
SIB and ICBC will each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the SIB
Stockholders Meeting and the ICBC Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same
date.   7.4. Acquisition Proposals. (a) ICBC and SIB each agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors
of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect,
a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than
any such transaction permitted by Section 6.2 in the case of   
-41-  SIB, and Section 6.3 in the case of ICBC, or any purchase or sale of
15% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries)
of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or
tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated,
would result in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially
owning securities representing 15% or more of its total voting power (or of
the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal
or offer made by the other party to this Agreement or an affiliate thereof)
being hereinafter referred as an "Acquisition Proposal" with respect to
either ICBC or SIB), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any
confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4(a),
in the event that, prior to the date of its Stockholders Meeting, a party
receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and its board of
directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, such party may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished confidential information or data and participate in
such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (based on the advice of its outside counsel) that
failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; provided that prior to providing (or causing to
be provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be provided
pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
such party than the Confidentiality Agreement. The term "Significant
Subsidiary" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
with respect to either ICBC or SIB means a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal which the Board of Directors of ICBC or SIB, as the case may be,
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of ICBC or SIB, as
the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably
capable of being fully financed and otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 7.4(a), except that the
reference to "15% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall
be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving voting securities of ICBC
or SIB, as the case may be.   (c) Each party will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any    -42-  persons other than
the other party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the other parties
thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential information previously
furnished by such party thereunder. Each party will (i) promptly (within one
Business Day) following the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or of any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, advise the other party of the substance thereof
(including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep the other party apprised of any related developments, discussions
and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a current basis and (ii) in the event of a person making a
Superior Proposal, furnish the other party a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with such person making such Superior Proposal and
other material documents.   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent a party or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
provided that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.   7.5. Legal Conditions to Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of ICBC and SIB shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger or the Savings Bank
Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party which is required to be obtained by SIB or ICBC or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no party
shall be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if
the taking of such action or the obtaining of such consents, authorizations,
orders, approvals or exemptions is reasonably likely to result in a condition
or restriction having an effect of the type referred to in Section
8.2(c).   (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including the proviso in Section 7.5(a)), each of ICBC and SIB agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts, plans or arrangements to
which ICBC or SIB is a party (to the extent permitted by the terms thereof)
if necessary in order to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in
Article VIII hereof, (ii) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order
or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) defend any litigation seeking
to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or seeking material damages.   7.6. Affiliates. SIB shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other
person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act) of SIB to deliver to ICBC, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement,    -43-  and in any event prior to the date of the SIB
Stockholders Meeting, a written agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to ICBC, relating to required transfer restrictions on the ICBC
Common Stock received by them in the Merger pursuant to Rule 145.   7.7.
Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.    (a) As of or as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, the employees of SIB and its Subsidiaries (the
"SIB Employees") shall become employees of ICBC or a Subsidiary thereof and
shall be eligible to participate in the ICBC Plans in which similarly
situated employees of ICBC or Independence Bank participate, to the same
extent as similarly situated employees of ICBC or Independence Bank (it being
understood that inclusion of SIB Employees in such employee benefit plans may
occur at different times with respect to different plans); provided, however,
that (i) nothing contained herein shall require ICBC or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any grants to any SIB Employee under the ICBC Stock
Option Plans or the ICBC 1998 Recognition and Retention Plan and
Trust Agreement, it being understood that any such grants are
completely discretionary, (ii) nothing contained herein shall require ICBC or
any of its Subsidiaries to permit a SIB Employee who is receiving severance
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
any employment, severance, consulting or other compensation agreements, plans
and arrangements with SIB or any of its Subsidiaries to participate in any
severance or change in control of agreement or plan offered by ICBC or any of
its Subsidiaries, (iii) nothing contained herein shall require an SIB
Employee\'s participation in the ICBC defined benefit pension plan and (iv)
nothing contained herein shall require an SIB Employee\'s participation in
the ICBC Employee Stock Ownership Plan prior to January 1, 2005.   (b) With
respect to each ICBC Plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation entitlement (but
not for participation or accrual of benefits under the ICBC defined benefit
pension plan), service with SIB or any Subsidiary shall be treated as service
with ICBC; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations with respect to any ICBC Plan. Each ICBC Plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable SIB Plan. SIB Employees shall be given full credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding SIB or any Subsidiary benefit plan during
the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the ICBC Plan during the applicable plan year.  
(c) As of the Effective Time, ICBC shall assume and honor and shall cause the
appropriate Subsidiaries of ICBC to assume and honor in accordance with their
terms all employment, severance and other compensation agreements, plans and
arrangements existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
which are between SIB or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer or employee
thereof and which have been disclosed in Section 4.11(a) of the
SIB Disclosure Schedule, including without limitation bank-owned life
insurance, other than those employment agreements covered by the Termination
and Release Agreements referenced in Section 7.7(d) hereof. ICBC acknowledges
and agrees that (i) the consummation of the Merger constitutes a "Change in
Control" for all purposes pursuant to such agreements, plans and
arrangements, and (ii) that the persons listed in Section 7.7(c) of the
SIB    -44-  Disclosure Schedule shall receive severance benefits as of
the Effective Time pursuant to the employment and severance agreements
entered into by such persons with SIB or its Subsidiaries, to the extent that
such employment and severance agreements have been disclosed to ICBC in the
SIB Disclosure Schedule and provided that such persons remain employed by SIB
or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. To the extent that an officer
or employee of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to the continued
receipt of health insurance, life insurance, automobile allowance or other
similar fringe benefits pursuant to any agreement set forth in Section
4.14(c) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule between SIB or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any officer or employee of SIB or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (the "Executive Agreements"), and such
officer or employee becomes a director, officer, employee or consultant of
ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time and as a
result becomes entitled to receive the same fringe benefits in his or her
capacity as a director, officer, employee or consultant of ICBC or any of its
Subsidiaries, then the fringe benefits provided to such person shall be
deemed to be provided in connection with such person\'s service as a
director, officer, employee or consultant of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries
for so long as such person serves in such capacity and shall be in lieu of,
and not in addition to (and for the sole purpose to avoid duplication of
benefits), the same fringe benefits that would have otherwise been provided
pursuant to the Executive Agreement.   (d) Concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement by the parties hereto, (i) each of Harry P. Doherty and
James R. Coyle and SIB, SIBT and ICBC shall enter into a Termination and
Release Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, (ii) Mr.
Doherty, ICBC and Independence Bank shall enter into an employment agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, and (iii) Mr. Coyle, ICBC and
Independence Bank shall enter into a noncompetition agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit C hereto.   (e) With respect to the SIB Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), SIB shall:   (i) take any actions
necessary to cause the ESOP to be terminated  and for the balances in all
Participant Accounts (as defined in the ESOP)  to become fully vested and
nonforfeitable as of the Effective Time;   (ii) cause the Trustee of the
ESOP to sell a number of shares of  ICBC Common Stock received in the Merger
as is necessary to obtain cash at  least equal to the remaining ESOP
indebtedness;   (iii) cause the Trustee to use such cash to repay in full
all such  outstanding ESOP indebtedness;   (iv) cause the shares of ICBC
Common Stock and/or any cash remaining  in the suspense account maintained
under the ESOP, after giving effect to  the repayment of ESOP indebtedness
referred to in subparagraph (iii)  above, to be allocated to the accounts of
all ESOP participants who have  account balances as of the beginning of the
ESOP plan year in which the  ESOP is terminated, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the  ESOP;     -45-   (v) cause the account
balances of all ESOP participants to be  distributed in a lump sum (or
transferred in accordance with Section  401(a)(31) of the Code) as soon as
practicable following the later of (A)  the Effective Time or (B) the date of
receipt of a favorable determination  letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the ESOP upon its  termination; and   (vi) adopt
amendment(s) to the ESOP, in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to
ICBC, as may be requested by the IRS in  connection with the request for a
determination letter.   (f) As soon as practicable after the date hereof,
SIB shall file a request for a determination letter from the IRS regarding
the continued qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination. Prior to the
Effective Time, SIB and, following the Effective Time, ICBC shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination
letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP and
the proposed allocation described herein as may be requested by the IRS as a
condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Neither SIB
nor ICBC shall implement any of the actions described in Sections 7.7(d)(iv)
and (v) above until receipt of such favorable determination letter.   (g)
As of the Effective Time, each SIB Employee who is a participant in the SIB
401(k) Plan (the "SIB 401(k) Plan") shall become fully vested in his or her
employer matching account balance in the SIB 401(k) Plan and the SIB 401(k)
Plan will either (x) be merged into the ICBC 401(k) Plan (the "ICBC 401(k)
Plan"), effective as of a date following the Effective Time, as selected by
ICBC, or (y) if so elected by ICBC, terminated immediately prior to, on
or after the Effective Time. The determination as to whether the SIB 401(k)
Plan shall be terminated or merged into the ICBC 401(k) Plan shall be made by
ICBC. Effective as of the date of the merger of the SIB 401(k) Plan into the
ICBC 401(k) Plan, if applicable, or the termination of the SIB 401(k) Plan
(or the Effective Time, if subsequent to such termination), if applicable,
SIB employees who are then participating in the SIB 401(k) Plan shall become
participants in the ICBC 401(k) Plan.   (h) As soon as practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, SIB will cooperate to cause the SIB
Recognition Plan to be amended (including, without limitation, amending the
SIB Recognition Plan to remove any provision that prohibits the termination
of such plan prior to awarding all unallocated shares under such plan) and
other necessary actions taken, in a manner reasonably acceptable to ICBC, to
provide that (i) the SIB Recognition Plan will terminate upon the Effective
Time and (ii) all unallocated shares of SIB Common Stock held in the trust
under the SIB Recognition Plan will be cancelled upon the Effective Time and
all assets relating to such unallocated shares will be distributed to SIB;
provided, however, that any distribution of shares under the SIB Recognition
Plan shall be effected in accordance with the requirements, if any, of
federal and state securities laws and regulations. No action shall be taken
that would adversely affect the rights of plan participants who
hold outstanding grants or awards of shares of SIB Common Stock, whether
before or after the Effective Time. No further grants or awards shall be made
by SIB or its Subsidiaries under the SIB Recognition Plan following the date
of this Agreement.   (i) ICBC agrees to honor the terms of each of the SIB
SERPs which have been disclosed in Section 4.11 of the SIB Disclosure
Schedule.     -46-   (j) Any person who is serving as an employee of
either SIB or any Subsidiary thereof as of the date of this Agreement (other
than those employees covered by either a written employment or severance
agreement) whose employment is discontinued by ICBC or any of its
Subsidiaries within one year after the Effective Time (unless termination of
such employment is for Cause (as defined below)) shall be entitled to a
severance payment from ICBC or its Subsidiary equal in amount to two week\'s
base pay for each full year such employee was employed by SIB or a SIB
Subsidiary or any successor or predecessor thereto, subject to a minimum of
two weeks\' severance and a maximum of 52 weeks\' severance; provided that
the benefits payable pursuant to this Section 7.7(j) shall be in lieu of, and
not in addition to, any amounts that may have otherwise been payable pursuant
to SIB\'s written severance policy described in Section 4.11(a) of the SIB
Disclosure Schedule and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein. For purposes of this Section 7.7(j), "Cause" shall mean termination
because of the employee\'s personal dishonesty, incompetence,
willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit,
intentional failure to perform stated duties or willful violation of any law,
rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses).  
(k) Section 7.7(k) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule sets forth the accrued but
unpaid vacation pay for employees of SIB and its Subsidiaries as of September
30, 2003. If the employment of any employee of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.7(k) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule is terminated
within twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, then any vacation pay
accrued and expensed (consistent with the financial statements provided by
SIB to ICBC) based on such employee\'s employment from January 1, 2004 to the
Effective Time shall be paid to the employee to the extent not used prior to
the termination of employment.   (l) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, pursuant to terms and conditions mutually agreed
to by ICBC and SIB after the date hereof, SIB may pay cash retention bonuses
to employees of SIB and its Subsidiaries who are selected by the chief
executive officer of SIB with the prior approval of ICBC, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, in order to help retain key employees (who are
not otherwise covered by an employment or similar contract) through the
Effective Time and for a specified period thereafter, provided that the
aggregate amount of such retention bonuses shall not exceed $800,000.   (m)
To the extent permitted by applicable law, ICBC shall assume and continue to
maintain the split dollar life insurance policies listed in Section 7.7(m) of
the SIB Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms of such policies;
provided, however, that ICBC shall not unreasonably terminate such policies
(it being understood, for the sake of clarity, that in the event that the tax
advantages to ICBC of maintaining such policies diminish due to a change in
the applicable tax laws or otherwise, any termination of such policies
by ICBC shall be deemed reasonable). This Section 7.7(m) is intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the named insureds in such
policies.   7.8. Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal
or administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of SIB, any of its
Subsidiaries or    -47-  any of their respective predecessors or was
prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, trust or other enterprise (a list of which with respect to the
directors and officers of SIB or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement is set forth in Section 7.8(a) of the SIB Disclosure Schedule)
or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
all actions taken by an Indemnified Party in connection herewith, whether in
any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, ICBC shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of SIB as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent
required by the DGCL, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced
expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify ICBC thereof,
provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
ICBC under this Section 7.8 except (and only) to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices ICBC. In the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with ICBC;
provided, however, that (A) ICBC shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and upon such assumption ICBC shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if (x) ICBC elects not to assume such defense or (y)
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between ICBC and the Indemnified
Parties, then the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with ICBC, and ICBC shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (B)
ICBC shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for
only one firm of counsel (in addition to local counsel) for any action or
group of related actions for all Indemnified Parties, (C) ICBC shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (D) ICBC shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law or regulation.   (b) Nothing contained in Section 7.8(a) or
any other provision of this Agreement shall limit any right to
indemnification which any current or former director, officer, employee or
agent of SIB may have under applicable law or regulation or the SIB\'s
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or the equivalent documents of any
Subsidiary of SIB, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof, which ICBC agrees to honor in accordance with their terms. Without
limiting the foregoing, ICBC also agrees that the limitations on liability
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties in SIB\'s Certificate
of Incorporation or the equivalent    -48-  documents of any SIB
Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect from and after the Effective Time.   (c) ICBC shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and
directors of SIB immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date by the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy or policies maintained by ICBC
(provided that ICBC\'s policy or policies provide at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the
aggregate not materially less advantageous to such directors and officers of
SIB than the terms and conditions of the existing directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy of SIB, and provided further that in no event will
ICBC be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the
annual premiums currently paid by SIB for the insurance covering the officers
and directors of SIB (the "Insurance Amount"), and provided, further, that if
ICBC is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section
7.8(c) as a result of the preceding proviso, ICBC shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the
Insurance Amount) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such.   (d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives.   (e) If ICBC or any of its
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other
entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of ICBC shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.8.   7.9. Advice of Changes. ICBC and SIB shall promptly advise
the other party of any change or event which, individually or in the
aggregate with other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein.   7.10.
Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably
practicable after they become available, but in no event more than 30 days,
after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement,
each party hereto shall furnish to the other party (i) consolidated and
consolidating financial statements (including balance sheet, statement
of operations and stockholders\' equity) of SIB and each of its Subsidiaries
or of ICBC and each of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as of and for
such month then ended and (ii) any internal management reports relating to
the foregoing. All information furnished by a party hereto pursuant to this
Section 7.10 shall be held in confidence by the other party to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreements.   7.11. Reorganization; Certain Modifications. (a) Neither ICBC
nor SIB shall take, or cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take, any
action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger or the Savings
Bank Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.    -49-   (b) At or before the Effective Time, upon
the request of ICBC, SIB shall, consistent with GAAP, modify and change its
employee benefits, loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices so as to be applied consistently on a mutually satisfactory basis
with those of ICBC; provided, however, that SIB shall not be required to take
such action (x) more than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and
(y) unless ICBC agrees in writing that all conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VIII have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
relating to delivery of documents on the Closing Date; and provided further
that no party\'s representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any
purpose as a consequence of any such actions which may be undertaken on
account of this Section 7.11(b)   7.12. Exemption From Liability Under
Section 16(b). Assuming that SIB delivers to ICBC the Section 16 Information
(as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of ICBC, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time
adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the SIB Insiders (as defined
below) of ICBC Common Stock in exchange for shares of SIB Common Stock, and
of options to purchase ICBC Common Stock upon conversion of SIB Options, in
each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by SIB to
ICBC prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt
shall be so exempt. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate
in all respects regarding the SIB Insiders, the number of shares of SIB
Common Stock held by each such SIB Insider and the number and description of
the SIB Options held by each such SIB Insider. "SIB Insiders" shall mean
those officers and directors of SIB who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are
listed in the Section 16 Information.   7.13. Stock Exchange Listing. ICBC
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of ICBC Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.    7.14. Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving
Company. Following the date of this Agreement, ICBC shall take all action
necessary to cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board
of Directors of the Surviving Company following the Effective Time to be
sixteen, consisting of (i) eleven members from the current Board of Directors
of ICBC, and (ii) the current Chief Executive Officer of SIB and four other
members of the Board of Directors of SIB selected by SIB and reasonably
acceptable to ICBC. The directors from the Board of Directors of SIB shall be
allocated among the three classes of directors of the Board of Directors of
ICBC as ratably as possible. Mr. Doherty shall be appointed as Vice Chairman
of the Board of Directors of both ICBC and Independence Bank for a period of
three years following the Effective Time. At the end of the initial term for
each of the five directors selected by SIB, the director shall be re-
nominated for an additional three-year term, subject to the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of ICBC and such directors meeting the eligibility
requirements set forth in ICBC\'s bylaws. In addition, the five directors
selected by SIB shall have proportional representation (or representation as
close to proportional as possible) on the major committees of the Board of
Directors of ICBC for a period of three years following the Effective Time.
ICBC\'s Board of Directors shall also take all necessary action following the
date of this Agreement to    -50-  cause the persons specified in Section
7.14 of the SIB Disclosure Schedule to be appointed to the offices of the
Surviving Company specified in such Schedule.   7.15. Advisory Board. ICBC
shall, as of the Effective Time, invite all of the members of SIB\'s Board of
Directors as of the date of this Agreement, other than those members selected
to be directors of ICBC, who are willing to serve to be appointed as members
of ICBC\'s advisory board with respect to deposit taking and mortgage lending
activities in SIBT\'s former primary market areas (the "Advisory Board"). The
members of the Advisory Board shall be elected to a term of three years
beginning on the Closing Date and non-employee members shall receive an
annual retainer fee for each year of such service of $62,500, which shall be
payable in monthly installments or in one lump sum at any time in advance at
the option of ICBC. Mr. Coyle shall be the chairman of the Advisory Board for
three years following the Effective Time.   7.16. Outplacement Services.
ICBC agrees to provide out-placement services to those officers of SIB or
SIBT with a title of Vice President or higher whose employment is terminated
for other than Cause (as defined in Section 7.7(j) hereof) within one year
following the Effective Time. The nature of the out-placement services shall
be mutually acceptable to ICBC and SIB and shall be determined in good
faith.   7.17. Division. For at least three years subsequent to the Savings
Bank Merger, the offices of (i) SIB immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the offices of ICBC, in each case which are located in Staten
Island, shall be operated as the "SI Bank and Trust Division of Independence
Community Bank."    ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   8.1.
Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective
obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the

contemplated hereby (including the approval of the Merger by the OTS under
HOLA; the approval of the Savings Bank Merger by the FDIC under the Bank
Merger Act and by the Superintendent under the New York banking law; and
approval of the dividend referred to in Section 5.4 by the Superintendent and
the OTS) shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect
and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired or
been terminated (all such approvals and the expiration or termination of all
such waiting periods being referred to herein as the "Requisite Regulatory
Approvals").     -51-   (d) S-4 Effectiveness. The S-4 shall have become
effective under the Securities Act, no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the S-4 shall have been issued and no proceedings for that
purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the SEC.    (e) No
Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No order, injunction or decree issued
by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition (an "Injunction") preventing the consummation of the Merger or

have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any Governmental
Entity which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger.  
8.2. Conditions to Obligations of ICBC. The obligations of ICBC to effect the
Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by ICBC at or prior
to the Effective Time of the following conditions:    (a) Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties of SIB set forth in this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of this condition, no effect shall be given to any exception in
such representations and warranties (other than the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 4.8(i)) relating to materiality or a Material
Adverse Effect, and provided, further, that, for purposes of this condition,

"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require SIB, ICBC or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action which would
violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or common),
rule or regulation.   10.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.    10.6. Entire Agreement.
This Agreement (together with the documents and the instruments referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.   
10.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except to the extent
that mandatory provisions of federal law or the DGCL are applicable).   
10.8. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision
of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all
cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.   10.9. Publicity.
ICBC and SIB shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such    -58-  press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules and
regulations of the NYSE (in the case of such a release or statement by SIB)
or the Nasdaq National Market (in the case of such a release or statement by
ICBC). Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, ICBC and SIB
shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and (b) make
appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In
addition, SIB and its Subsidiaries shall (a) consult with ICBC regarding
communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and
employees related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) provide ICBC
with stockholder lists of SIB and (c) allow and facilitate ICBC contact with
stockholders of SIB and other prospective investors.   10.10. Assignment;
Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein
(including Section 7.8 hereof), this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
