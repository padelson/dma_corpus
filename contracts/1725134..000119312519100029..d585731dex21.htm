ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK OF LEO AND THE COMPANY



   2.1 |

Effect on Capital Stock 

---|--- 
 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Company, Leo or any Subsidiary or the holders of any Leo
Common Stock (as defined herein) or Company Stock (as defined herein):

 

(i) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. All shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, and common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in the
Company (collectively the " _Company Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(ii) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenting
Shares and Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(i)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)(ii)_
and the right to receive the applicable Earnout Shares, if any, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_. The Company Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)(ii)_, the right to receive the applicable
Earnout Shares, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the delivery of a
Letter of Transmittal (including all certificates representing shares of
Company Stock to the extent any such certificates have been issued by the
Company (a " _Certificate_ ")), without interest. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Leo Common Stock or Company Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any equity dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event
(including the Domestication) shall have occurred, then any number or amount
contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Leo Common Stock
or Company Stock, as the case may be, will be equitably adjusted to provide to
Leo and the holders of Company Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
sentence shall not be construed to permit Leo or the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



5

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ above, unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. The holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect such appraisal right in
accordance with the DGCL or withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive from the Surviving
Company, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration and the right to receive the applicable
Earnout Shares, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ without any interest
thereon. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section

_Base Share Consideration_ "), _plus_ (B) the Additional Seller Shares.

 

(ii) The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration to be received by

to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_).

be adjusted equitably to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Leo Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Leo Common Stock after the date of this
Agreement (including any of the foregoing in connection with the

Company Stock, other than the Seller, a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall have customary representations and warranties as

_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_) shall be deemed at any time from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of Company Stock were
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.2(c)_ (and cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ and the right to receive the applicable Earnout

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, (i) upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and (ii) if required by Leo, the provision by such Person
of an indemnity (in form and substance mutually agreed by Leo and the Company)
against any claim that may be made against it, the Company, or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, Leo will issue the Merger
Consideration Per Share such Person has a right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _ Section 2.2(h)_).

 

(e) _Treatment of Unissued Shares_. No dividends or other distributions

---|--- 
 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement existing in favor of the current
or former directors, officers, employees and agents of any member of the
Company Group or Leo and each Person who served at the request of the Company
or Leo as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_"), as
provided in the certificate of incorporation, articles of organization, bylaws
or similar constituent documents of any member of the Company Group in effect
on the date of this Agreement, or in any indemnification agreement or
arrangement as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Closing, shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect and that any member of the Company Group will perform
and discharge such member of the Company Groups respective obligations to
provide such indemnity and exculpation from and after the Closing for a period
of six years or until the settlement or final adjudication of any Action
commenced during such period. The Surviving Company shall cause the Surviving
Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Surviving Company Bylaws to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of the DandO Indemnified Persons no less favorable to the
DandO Indemnified Persons than set forth in the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable governing documents), as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of any DandO Indemnified Person thereunder except as
is required under applicable Law. From and after the Closing, the Surviving
Company shall assume, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the
members of the Company Group to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

 

(b) From and following the Closing Date, the Surviving Company, shall, and
shall cause the members of the Company Group to, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings
required by applicable Law) each of the DandO Indemnified Persons against any
liabilities, losses, penalties, fines, claims, damages, reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses in connection with any actual
or threatened, in writing, Action, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred
in such DandO Indemnified Persons capacity as a director or officer of any
member of the Company Group, or in such DandO Indemnified Persons capacity as
a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of any member of the Company
Group, before the Closing Date (including acts or omissions in connection with
such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity
if such service was at the request or for the benefit of any member of the
Company Group). In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Company and the
members of the Company Group, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with
the DandO Indemnified Person in the defense of any Action;  _provided_ , that
none of the Surviving Company and the members of the Company Group shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each of
Leo and the Company hereby

 



59

    

 acknowledges that certain DandO Indemnified Persons may have rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by a former stockholder
of the Company (including the Seller) or its respective Affiliates (each, a "
_Former Stockholder Indemnitor_ ") (directly or through insurance obtained by
any such entity). Each of Leo and the Company hereby agrees and acknowledges
that (i) the Surviving Company is the indemnitor of first resort with respect
to the DandO Indemnified Persons, (ii) the Surviving Company shall be required
to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the DandO Indemnified
Persons, as required by Law, the terms of the Surviving Companys
organizational documents, any applicable agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise, without regard to any rights the DandO
Indemnified Persons may have against any Former Stockholder Indemnitors and
(iii) to the extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Former Stockholder Indemnitors from any
and all claims for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any
kind in respect thereof. Each of Leo and the Company further agrees no
advancement or payment by any Former Stockholder Indemnitor with respect to
any claim for which the DandO Indemnified Persons have sought indemnification
pursuant hereto shall affect the foregoing, and such Former Stockholder
Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the
DandO Indemnified Persons against the Surviving Company.

(c) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, the Surviving Company
shall maintain directors and officers liability insurance covering (as
direct beneficiaries) all DandO Indemnified Persons, in each case of the type
and with the amount of coverage no less favorable than those of the directors
and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date of this Agreement
by, or for the benefit of, the Company Group (the " _Current Policies_ "), and
with such other terms as are no less favorable than those in the Current
Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the Surviving
Company be obligated to pay annual premiums greater than 300% of such premiums
paid or payable as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) if the annual
premium for such coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 300% of such
current annual rate, the Surviving Company shall provide the maximum coverage
which shall then be available at an annual premium not exceeding 300% of such
rate. The Surviving Company shall maintain any such directors and officers
liability insurance in full force and effect for its full term, and honor all
obligations thereunder (including the payment of any applicable premiums).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall obtain prior to the Closing
a fully-paid six-year "tail" insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail_") with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance of the type and with
the amount of coverage and such other terms as are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those in the Current Policies, and the cost of the DandO Tail
shall be included as a Transaction Cost. The Surviving Company shall maintain
the DandO Tail in full force and effect for its full term and will honor all
obligations thereunder.

 

(d) If the Surviving Company or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume
all of the obligations of the Surviving Company set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 7.8_.

 



60

    

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall survive the Closing
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each DandO Indemnified Person, and each DandO Indemnified Persons heirs,
legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Leo and may not be terminated or amended in any
manner adverse to such DandO Indemnified Person without its prior written
consent and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise.

Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, including those on
vacation, sick leave, maternity leave, military service, lay-off, disability
or other approved leave of absence (such employees, collectively, the "
_Company Group Employees_ "). During the 12-month period following the
Effective Time (the " _Benefit Period_ "), the Surviving Company shall, or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide the Company Group Employees
who continue to be actively employed by the Surviving Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) during such 12-month period with base salary and base wages to
such Company Group Employees that are substantially similar to those provided
to the Company Group Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and
with annual target cash bonus opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, equity or equity based compensation, deferred compensation, or
transaction bonuses) and 401(k) and group health benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to the similarly
situated Company Group Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefits that are provided to the Company
Group Employees under employee benefits plans of the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Surviving Company_ _Plans_ ") that replace the Benefit
Plans (as provided by the Company Group immediately prior to the Effective
Time) during the Benefit Period for such Company Group Employee, the
Surviving Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that each Company Group Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, and service
accrued by the Company Group Employees during employment with any member of
each Company Group or their predecessors prior to Closing Date shall be
recognized to the same extent and for the same purpose as recognized
under the analogous Benefit Plan, except to the extent necessary to prevent
duplication of benefits. With respect to any medical, dental or other group
health benefits that are provided to the Company Group Employees under the
Surviving Company Plans, the Surviving Company shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that any
applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
(except to the extent not satisfied under the comparable Benefit Plan as of
such time) shall be waived, and any expenses incurred before such time under
the comparable Benefit Plan shall be taken into account under such the
Surviving Company Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions.

 



61

    

(c) Nothing herein shall (i) be construed to establish or be treated as an
amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan or Surviving Company Plan, (ii)
alter or limit the Surviving Companys ability to amend, modify or interpret
or terminate any Surviving Company Plan at any time in accordance with the
terms of such plan and applicable Law or (iii) give any third party, including
any Company Group Employee, any right to continued employment or any
particular term or condition of employment following the Closing or to rely
upon or demand or enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

from any other Person responsible for such Damages (net of any actual
expenses incurred by such Leo Indemnified Party in connection with such
recovery). If a Leo Indemnified Party actually receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person responsible for any
Damages subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Seller, then such Leo
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Seller for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket payment made or expense incurred by the Seller in
connection with providing such indemnification up to the amount received by
the Leo Indemnified Party, net of any actual expenses incurred by such Leo
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 



75

    

(e) In the case of any claim for indemnification arising from a claim of a
third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), a Leo Indemnified Party shall give
prompt written notice to the Seller (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") of any claim or
demand for which such Leo Indemnified Party has knowledge and as to which it
may request indemnification hereunder ( _provided_ _that_ no delay on the part
of the Leo Indemnified Party in notifying the Seller shall relieve the Seller
from any indemnification obligation hereunder unless the Seller is actually
materially prejudiced as a result of such delay). With respect to any Third-
Party Claim, the Notice of Claim shall describe the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such claim, the basis upon which indemnity is being sought and
the amount or estimated amount of such claim (to the extent then reasonably
determinable by the Leo Indemnified Party) and shall include copies of any
documents served on the Leo Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Seller shall have the right
to defend and to direct the defense against any such Third-Party Claim (other
than any Third-Party Claim that constitutes or arises out of an Action
relating to Taxes), in its name or in the name of the Leo Indemnified Party,
as the case may be, at the expense of the Seller, and with counsel selected by
the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall not be entitled to
assume the defense or control of a Third-Party Claim (and the Leo Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to have sole control over the defense of such Third-
Party Claim) if (i) such Third-Party Claim involves any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation or (ii) counsel to the Leo
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that (A) there is a conflict
of interest other than the indemnity obligations between the Leo Indemnified
Party and the Seller in the conduct of the defense of such Third-Party Claim
(other than any conflict of interest arising out of the indemnification rights
and obligations of the parties hereunder) or (B) the Leo Indemnified Party has
one or more defenses not available to the Seller;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in the event any Third-Party Claim is brought or asserted that (together
with all other claims against the Seller that are subject to unresolved
Notices of Claim) seeks recovery in excess of the then remaining portion of
the Cap, the Leo Indemnified Party may elect to participate in a joint defense
of such Third-Party Claim at the expense of such Leo Indemnified Party and
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to both parties. The Leo Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim with counsel employed at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of any Third-Party Claim described in clause (i) and (ii) above or
as to which the Seller shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Seller.
No compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Seller without the Leo Indemnified Partys written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (x) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law and no effect on any other claims that
may be made against such Leo Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (y) each
Leo Indemnified Party that is party to such Third-Party Claim is fully and
unconditionally released from liability with respect to such claim. The Seller
shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any Third-Party
Claim which shall be settled by the Leo Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(f) In the event that a Leo Indemnified Party determines that it has a
claim for Damages against a Seller under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ other
than as a result of a Third-Party Claim (an " _Inter-Party Claim_ "), the Leo
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Seller a Notice of Claim with
respect to such Inter-Party Claim, which Notice of Claim shall describe the
facts and

 



76

    

 circumstances giving rise to such claim, the basis upon which indemnity is
being sought and the amount or estimated amount of such claim (to the extent
then reasonably determinable by the Leo Indemnified Party) ( _provided_
_that_ no delay on the part of the Leo Indemnified Party in notifying the
Seller shall relieve the Seller from any indemnification obligation hereunder
unless the Seller is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such
delay). The Leo Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the
Seller in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Leo
Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation will include, subject to advance notice by the Seller,
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters. The Seller shall notify the
Leo Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of a
Notice of Claim if the Seller disputes its liability to the Leo Indemnified
Party under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_. If the Seller has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim as provided above, the Seller and the Leo
Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
no notice of dispute is delivered by the Seller within fifteen (15) days of
the Sellers receipt of the Notice of Claim or such dispute remains unresolved
as of the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt by Leo of the Sellers timely
delivery of its notice of dispute, the Leo Indemnified Party shall have the
right to commence an Action against the Seller to seek to enforce its
purported rights to indemnification from and against any Damages that are
the subject of such Notice of Claim.

(g) Promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days following
the final determination of the amount of any Damages payable by the Seller to
any Leo Indemnified Party pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Seller under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, the Seller shall, subject to the
Cap, pay to Leo or such Leo Indemnified Party the amount of such Damages as
so determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing by Leo or such Leo Indemnified Party, provided
that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit claims or
remedies for Fraud.

(h) Leo acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, its and
each Leo Indemnified Partys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement, the
Related Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
Company Group and their respective assets and liabilities, the Company Stock
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
X_ ; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
limit claims or remedies for Fraud or specific performance.

(i) Solely for the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, by execution
and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and pursuant to the Leo
Shareholder Approvals, Sponsor shall be appointed as the representative and
attorney-in-fact of all shareholders of record of Leo as of immediately prior
to the date hereof in their capacities as a Leo Indemnified Party, with full
power and authority, including power of substitution, to act on behalf of
such Leo Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, which Sponsor may
deem necessary or advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and the performance of all obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_ following the Closing, including, but not limited to,
the exercise of the power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications
to or from such Leo Indemnified Party relating to this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_;
(ii) negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle any claims for

 



77

    

 indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ on behalf of each such Leo
Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, (iii) to do each and every
act and exercise any and all rights which each such Leo Indemnified Party is,
or collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under _Section_
__ _ 10.2_, and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of Sponsor for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Sponsor
shall have the authority and power to act on behalf of each such Leo
Indemnified Party with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all claims under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and all rights or
obligations arising hereunder. Such Leo Indemnified Parties shall be bound by
all actions taken and documents executed by Sponsor in connection with this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, and the Seller shall be entitled to rely on any action
or decision of Sponsor related thereto. Sponsor shall receive no compensation
for its services. Notices or communications to or from Sponsor with
respect to this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ shall constitute notice to or from each
such Leo Indemnified Party. In performing the functions specified in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(i)_, Sponsor shall not be liable to any such
Leo Indemnified Party for any damages, losses or liabilities whatsoever,
other than actual losses that are determined by a final, nonappealable
judgement of Delaware court to have been primarily caused by the willful
misconduct of Sponsor.

Severability 

---|--- 
 

It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this
Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall
be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn,
without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



79

       10.5 |

Specific Performance 

---|--- 
 

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and the Related Documents and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Related Documents.



   10.6 |

Entire Agreement 

---|--- 
 

This Agreement, the Related Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto) contain the entire
agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
relating to such subject matter. No party shall be liable or bound to any
other party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants
relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth herein or in
the Related Documents or the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



   10.7 |

Assignment 

---|--- 
 

This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be
assignable or transferable by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part
(including by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation or
conversion of Leo, other than the Domestication), without the prior written
consent of the other parties, which any such party may withhold in its
absolute discretion.



   10.8 |

No Third-Party Beneficiaries 

---|--- 
 

Except as set forth in the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing in
this Agreement expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and such successors and permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (a) each of the Related
Parties shall be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in

DandO Indemnified Persons shall be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ and (ii) the Sellers and the Company
Representatives shall be third-party beneficiaries of the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_.



   10.9 |

Amendment 

---|--- 
 

This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement at any time
before the Closing, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
party, and any purported amendment, modification or supplement by any of the

shall be void and of no force and effect.

 



80

       10.10 |

Waiver 

---|--- 
 

No provision of this Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by the party or parties against whom such waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.



   10.11 |

Governing Law; Jurisdiction 

---|--- 
 

(a) This Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies relating to,
arising out of, or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State, without
giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 

(b) Each party irrevocably agrees that any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by the other party or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (or, solely if such courts decline jurisdiction, in any federal
court located in the State of Delaware), and each party hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and
with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to
any such Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees not to commence any
Action relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware,
other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any
judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described
herein. Each party further agrees that notice as provided herein shall
constitute sufficient service of process and each party further waives any
argument that such service is insufficient. Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action
or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



81

       10.12 |

Waiver of Jury Trial

TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.12_.



   10.13 |

---|---

equity, or granted by statute whether by or though attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil) that may be

with, or relate in any manner to (i) this Agreement, (ii) the negotiation,

any breach or violation of this Agreement and (iv) any failure of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement to be

furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, and
notwithstanding the fact that certain of the parties may be partnerships or
limited liability companies, each party hereto covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement, any Related Document

indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees (each a " _Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Related
Parties_ "), in each case other than the parties hereto and each of their
respective successors and permitted assignees under this Agreement (and, in
the case of any Related Document, the applicable parties thereto and each of
their respective successors and permitted assigns), whether in Contract, tort,
by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding,
or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed

respective successors or permitted assigns for any breach or violation of its
obligations under such agreements, documents or instruments.

No Presumption Against Drafting Party 

---|---

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the
drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

 



   10.18 |

Company and the Seller Privilege 

---|--- 
 

The Seller has advised Leo that Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP (the " _Firm_ ")
has represented both the Company and the Seller prior to the Closing with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Pre-Closing
Engagement_"), and, recognizing that the Seller intends to engage the Firm
to act as legal counsel to the Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing,
Leo hereby waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, to the extent permissible, the Surviving Company after the
Closing), to waive any conflict of interest that may arise in connection with
the Firm representing the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing as
it relates to the Pre-Closing Engagement. In light of the foregoing and
subject to the following sentence, the Parties agree that any attorney-client
privilege or attorney work-product to the extent recognized as such under
applicable Law with respect to the Pre-Closing Engagement and all information
and documents to the extent covered by such privilege or protection under
applicable Law and all confidential communications solely between and
documents solely exchanged by the Company Group, the Seller, their respective
Affiliates, on one hand, and the Firm, on the other hand, with respect to the
Pre-Closing Engagement (the " _Privileged Communications_ ") shall belong to
and be controlled by the Seller (and not the Company Group) and may be waived
only by the Seller (and not the Company Group) and shall not pass to or be
claimed or used by Leo, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing. Accordingly, the Company Group shall not,
without the Sellers consent, have access to the files of the Firm relating to
the Pre-Closing Engagement to the extent they constitute Privileged
Communications. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and
after the Closing, (a) the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Company
Group) shall be the sole holders of the Privileged Communications with respect
to the Pre-Closing Engagement, and no member of the Company Group shall be a
holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of the Firm in respect of the
Pre-Closing Engagement constitute property of the Seller or
Privileged Communications, only the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the
Company Group) shall hold such property rights and (c) the Firm shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such Privileged Communications to
any of the Company Group by reason of any attorney-client

 



84

    

 relationship between the Firm and the Company Group or otherwise. The Firm
shall not disclose any Privileged Communications to any third parties (other
than representatives, accountants and advisors of the Seller and its
respective Affiliates; _provided_ , that such representatives, accountants and
advisors are instructed to maintain the confidence of the Privileged
Communications).

 



   10.19 |

Execution of Agreement 

---|--- 
 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one
or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party. Facsimile or electronic mail transmission of
counterpart signatures to this Agreement shall be acceptable and binding.

(iv) for so long as the Stockholder Shares equal or exceed 10% (but
represent less than 20%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock Issued
and Outstanding, the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as applicable,
shall have the right to nominate, in the aggregate, a number of Stockholder

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from and after
the Effective Time and until the Sponsor Termination Event shall have
occurred, the Company will, as promptly as practicable, take all necessary and
desirable actions within its control (including, without limitation, calling
special meetings of the Board and the stockholders of the Company and
recommending, supporting and soliciting proxies), so that:

 

(i) for so long as the Sponsor Amount equals or exceeds 50%, the Sponsor
shall have the right to (A) nominate, in the aggregate, a number of Sponsor
Nominees equal to three and (B) appoint one of such three Sponsor Directors as
the Co-Chairman of the Board;

 

(ii) for so long as the Stockholder Amount equals or exceeds 25% (but is
less than 50%), the Sponsor shall have the right to (A) nominate, in the
aggregate, a number of Sponsor Nominees equal to two and (B) appoint one of
such two Sponsor Directors as the Co-Chairman of the Board; and

 

(iii) for so long as the Sponsor Amount equals or exceeds 10% (but is less
than 25%), the Sponsor shall have the right to nominate one Sponsor Nominee.

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that: (i) the
applicable Nominees are included in the Boards slate of nominees to the
stockholders of the Company for each election of Directors and (ii) each
applicable Nominee up for election is included in the proxy statement
prepared by management of the Company in connection with soliciting proxies
for every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to
the election of Directors, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof,
and on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company with respect to the election of members of the Board. If prior to the
stockholders meeting (or action by written consent) a Nominee ceases to be a
nominee due to such Nominees death, disability, withdrawal as a nominee for
election to the Board or for any other reason, the Company shall, if
practicable and subject to _Section_ __ _ 1(g)_ below, take such steps as
appropriate to cause such replacement Nominee as may be designated by the
Stockholder, or its permitted assigns, or Sponsor, as applicable, to be
included in such slate of nominees for election.

 

(f) If (i) a vacancy on the Board occurs because of the death, disability,
disqualification, resignation, or removal of a Stockholder Director or
Sponsor Director or for any other reason a vacancy on the Board occurs with
respect to a Director position held by a Stockholder Director or Sponsor
Director, as applicable, immediately prior to the occurrence of such vacancy,
and (ii) immediately prior to the occurrence of such vacancy, the Stockholder
or its permitted assigns, or the Sponsor, as applicable, had the right to
nominate a Nominee for such Director position pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 1(d)_, as applicable, then the Stockholder, or its
permitted assignees, or Sponsor, as applicable, shall be entitled to designate
such Stockholder Directors or Sponsor Directors, as applicable successor
Nominee, and the Company will, within ten days of such designation of a
successor Nominee, take all necessary and desirable actions within its control
such that such vacancy shall be filled with such successor Nominee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Director position for such
Stockholder Director or such Sponsor Director shall not be filled pending such
designation and appointment unless the Stockholder or its permitted
assignees, or Sponsor, as applicable, fails to designate such successor
Nominee within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Company
notifying the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, or Sponsor, as
applicable, that such vacancy has occurred, and after such 30-day period, the
Company may appoint a successor nominee who may serve as a Director only until
the Stockholder or Sponsor, or its permitted assignees, as applicable,
designates such successor Nominee.

 



3

    

(g) If a Nominee is not elected because of such Nominees
death, disability, disqualification, withdrawal as a nominee for election to
the Board or for any other reason (and such Nominee is not replaced as a
nominee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1(e)_ above), (i) the Stockholder, or its
permitted assignees, or Sponsor, as applicable, shall be entitled to
designate promptly a replacement Nominee, (ii) the Company will, within ten
days of such designation, take all necessary and desirable actions within its
control such that such replacement Nominee is appointed as a Director the
Company and (iii) the Company will take all necessary and desirable actions
within its control such that the Director position for which the original
Nominee was nominated shall not be filled pending such designation of a
replacement Nominee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Director
position for which such original Nominee was nominated shall not be filled
pending such designation and appointment unless the Stockholder, or its
permitted assigns, or Sponsor, as applicable, fails to designate such
replacement Nominee within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the
Company notifying the Stockholder, or its permitted assigns, or Sponsor, as
applicable, that such Nominee was not elected, and after such 30-day period,
the Company may appoint a successor nominee who may serve as a Director only
until the Stockholder, or its permitted assigns, or Sponsor, as
applicable, designates such replacement Nominee.

(h) The Company shall pay the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by each Stockholder Director and Sponsor Director in connection with
his or her services provided to or on behalf of the Company, including, but
not limited to, attending meetings or events attended on behalf of the Company
at the Companys request.

 

(i) In accordance with the Bylaws, the Board may from time to time by
resolution establish and maintain one or more committees of the Board, each
committee to consist of one or more Directors. To the extent feasible, the
Company shall notify the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as
applicable, in writing of any new committee of the Board to be established at
least 15 days prior to the effective establishment of such committee. If
requested by the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as applicable, the
Company shall take all necessary steps to cause at least one Stockholder
Director as requested by Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as
applicable, to be appointed as a member of each such committee of the Board
unless such designation would violate any legal restriction on such
committees composition or the rules and regulations of any applicable
exchange on which the Companys securities may be listed.

(j) The Company shall (i) purchase directors and officers liability
insurance in an amount determined by the Board to be reasonable and customary
and (ii) for so long as any Stockholder Director or Sponsor Director serves as
a Director, maintain such directors and officers liability insurance
coverage with respect to such Director; _provided_ , that upon removal or
resignation of such Stockholder Director or Sponsor Director for any reason,
the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to extend such
directors and officers liability insurance coverage with respect to such
Stockholder Director or Sponsor Director for a period of not less than six
years from any such event in respect of any act or omission of such
Stockholder Director or Sponsor Director occurring at or prior to such event.

 



4

    

(k) For so long as any Stockholder Director or Sponsor Director serves as
a Director, (i) the Company shall provide such Stockholder Director or Sponsor
Director with the same expense reimbursement, benefits, indemnity, exculpation
and other arrangements provided to the other Directors; _provided_ , that any
Stockholder Director and Sponsor Director who is also an employee of the
Stockholder or Sponsor (or its Affiliates), as applicable, may elect not to
receive any standard director fees paid by the Company to Directors, and (ii)
the Company shall not amend, alter or repeal any right to indemnification or
exculpation covering or benefiting any Stockholder Director or Sponsor
Director nominated pursuant to this Agreement as and to the extent consistent
with applicable law, including but not limited to Article SIXTH of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Article VII of the Bylaws (whether such right
is contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or another
document) (except to the extent such amendment or alteration permits the
Company to provide broader indemnification or exculpation rights on a
retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto).

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Stockholder, or
its permitted assignees, as applicable, has the right to designate one or
more Nominees and either has not exercised such right or the applicable
Nominee has not been elected as a Stockholder Director, then the Stockholder,
or its permitted assignees, as applicable, may elect at such time, in its
sole discretion, to designate one Board observer (regardless of the number of
such designation rights held by the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees,
as applicable) (each, a " _Board Observer_ ") to attend and participate in
all meetings of the Board or any committees thereof, in a non-voting capacity
by the giving of written notice to the Company of such election (each, a "
_Observation Election_ "). In connection therewith, the Company shall
simultaneously give each Board Observer copies of all notices, consents,
minutes and other materials, financial or otherwise, which the Company
provides to the Board;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Board Observer
does not, upon the request of the Company, before attending any meetings of
the Board, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to abide by all
Company policies applicable to Directors and a confidentiality agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company, such Board Observer may be excluded from
access to any material or meeting or portion thereof if the Board determines
in good faith that such exclusion is reasonably necessary to protect highly
confidential and proprietary information of the Company or confidential and
proprietary information of third-parties that the Company is required to hold
in confidence, or for other similar reasons. The Stockholder, or its
permitted assignees, as applicable, may revoke any such Observation Election
at any time upon written notice to the Company after which the Stockholder, or
its permitted assignees, as applicable, shall be entitled to designate a
replacement Board Observer.

(m) At any time when (i) the Sponsor has the right to designate any Sponsor
Nominees, all such Sponsor Nominees must qualify as "independent" pursuant to
listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") applicable to
directors other than members of the audit committee and (ii) the Sponsor has
the right to designate three Sponsor Nominees pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1(d)(i)_, at least one must qualify as "independent" pursuant to listing
standards of the NYSE applicable to directors serving as members of the audit
committee and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(collectively, the " _Audit Committee Independence Requirements_ "). At any
time when (i) the Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as applicable, has
the right to designate four Stockholder Nominees pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1(c)(ii)_, at least one Stockholder Nominee must qualify as "independent"
pursuant to the Audit Committee Independence Requirements, and (ii) the
Stockholder, or its permitted assignees, as applicable, has

 



5

    

 the right to designate five Stockholder Nominees pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1(c)(i)_, at least two Stockholder Nominees must qualify as "independent"
pursuant to the Audit Committee Independence Requirements. For the avoidance
of doubt, (i) at all times that the "controlled company" exception to the NYSE
listing standards does not apply to the Company, a majority of Directors must
qualify as "independent" pursuant to listing standards of NYSE applicable to
directors other than members of the audit committee, and (ii) at all times,
three Directors must qualify as "independent" pursuant to the Audit
Committee Independence Requirements.

the Common Stock owned by the Additional Stockholders, which the Company
shall provide to the Stockholder from time to time upon request.

to, any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns any remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any
terms, covenants or conditions hereof, and all of the terms, covenants,

in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining

provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

contained herein, (a) if the Stockholder Shares cease to equal or exceed 10%
of the total number of shares of Common Stock Issued and Outstanding (the "

REGISTRATIONS

 

2.1 _Shelf Registration_.

 

2.1.1 _Filing_. The Company shall file, within 30 days of the Closing
Date, a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-3 (the "
_Form S-3 Shelf_") or if the Company is ineligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf, a
Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1 (the " _Form S-1
Shelf_," and together with the Form S-3 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf
Registration), the " _Shelf_ "), in each case, covering the resale of all the
Registrable Securities (determined as of two business days prior to
such filing) on a delayed or continuous basis. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf to become effective as soon
as practicable after such filing. The Shelf shall provide for the resale of
the Registrable Securities included therein pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder. The
Company shall maintain the Shelf in accordance with the terms hereof, and
shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, including post-effective
amendments, and supplements as may be necessary to keep such Shelf
continuously effective,

 



5

    

 available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities
Act until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities. In the
event the Company files a Form S-1 Shelf, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form S-1 Shelf (and any
Subsequent Shelf Registration) to a Form S-3 Shelf as soon as practicable
after the Company is eligible to use Form S-3.

 

2.1.2 _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. If any Shelf ceases to be effective
under the Securities Act for any reason at any time while Registrable
Securities are still outstanding, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such
Shelf to again become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining
the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such
Shelf), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is
reasonably practicable amend such Shelf in a manner reasonably expected to
result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such
Shelf or file an additional registration statement as a Shelf Registration (a
" _Subsequent Shelf Registration_ ") registering the resale of all Registrable
Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or combination of
methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder. If a Subsequent
Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the
filing thereof (it being agreed that the Subsequent Shelf Registration shall
be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if the Company is a Well-Known
Seasoned Issuer) and (ii) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously
effective, available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any Registrable
Securities. Any such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 to the
extent that the Company is eligible to use such form. Otherwise, such
Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another appropriate form. In the
event that (i) Earnout Shares are issued, or (ii) any Holder holds Registrable
Securities that are not registered for resale on a delayed or continuous
basis, the Company, upon request of a Holder shall promptly use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the resale of such Registrable
Securities to be covered by either, at the Companys option, the Shelf
(including by means of a post-effective amendment) or a Subsequent
Shelf Registration and cause the same to become effective as soon as
practicable after such filing and such Shelf or Subsequent Shelf Registration
shall be subject to the terms hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
shall only be required to cause such Registrable Securities to be so covered
once annually after inquiry of the Holders unless the Registrable Securities
are Earnout Shares delivered pursuant to the BCA in which case the Company
shall register such shares as soon as reasonably possible following issuance,
but in no event more than 90 days thereafter.

2.1.3 _Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. At any time and from
time to time after the Shelf has been declared effective by the Commission,
the Lion Holders or any Sellers Shareholders (but for the avoidance of doubt,
no Management Holder) may request to sell all or any portion of its
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant
to the Shelf (each, an " _Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "); _provided_ that the
Company shall only be obligated to effect an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if
such offering shall include securities with a total offering price (including
piggyback securities and before deduction of underwriting discounts)
reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $20.0 million (the "
_Minimum Takedown Threshold_ "); provided that the Minimum Takedown Threshold
shall not apply to an Underwritten Shelf Takedown solely of Earnout Shares.
All requests for Underwritten Shelf 

 



6

    

 Takedowns shall be made by giving written notice to the Company, which shall
specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the expected price range (net of
underwriting discounts and commissions) of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown.
During an Excess Scenario, (i) the Lion Holders must provide five (5) business
days written notice to the Sellers Shareholders and their transferee
Holders prior to any request for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown to be
requested by any Lion Holder, and (ii) if at any time during such five (5)
business day period, the Sellers Shareholders or their transferee Holders
demand an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, then such Sellers Shareholders
Underwritten Shelf Takedown demand shall take effect (and constitute one
demand for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.3_) and the Company shall
include such number of Registrable Securities that the Sellers Shareholders
and their transferee Holders and the Lion Holders desire to sell to such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown. If an Underwritten Shelf Takedown is effected in
the manner described in the foregoing sentence, the Sellers Shareholders and
their transferee Holders participating in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown
shall be deemed to be the Demanding Holders, and the Lion Holders
participating in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be deemed to be
Requesting Holders. The Holders that requested such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown (the " _Demanding Holders_ ") shall have the right to select the
Underwriters for such offering (which shall consist of one or more reputable
nationally or regionally recognized investment banks), and to agree to the
pricing and other terms of such offering. The Lion Holders may demand three
Underwritten Shelf Takedowns in total and the Sellers Shareholders (on a
collective basis) may demand four Underwritten Shelf Takedowns in total;
provided that the Sellers Shareholders shall be entitled to a fifth demand
that may only be used with respect to Earnout Shares. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, in no event shall may Lion Capital or any transferee
thereof request an Underwritten Shelf Takedown during the Lock-Up Period.

 

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good faith, advise the
Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing
that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together
with all other shares of Common Stock or other equity securities that the
Company desires to sell and all other Common Stock or other equity securities,
if any, that have been requested to be sold in such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback registration
rights held by any other shareholders, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten
Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing,
the distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the
" _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such
Underwritten Offering, as follows: At all times (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) ( _pro
rata_ based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (iii)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Registrable Securities
of other Holders, including Management Holders, requested to be included
pursuant to

 



7

    

 Section 2.2, and (iv) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), the Common Stock or other equity securities of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to include in such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such
persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Securities.

2.1.5 _Withdrawal_. Any of the Demanding Holders initiating a Shelf
Takedown shall have the right to withdraw from a Shelf Takedown for any or no
reason whatsoever upon written notification (a " _Withdrawal Notice_ ") to the
Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of their intention to
withdraw from such Shelf Takedown; _provided_ that the Lion Holders or any
Sellers Shareholders may elect to have the Company continue an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown if the Minimum Takedown Threshold would still be satisfied. If
withdrawn, a demand for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall constitute a
demand for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown for purposes of _subsection 2.1.3_ ,
unless either (i) such withdrawal occurs during a period the Company has
deferred taking action pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ hereof or (ii) the
Holder reimburses the Company for all Registration Expenses with respect to
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown; _provided_ , that if a Holder elects to
continue an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence, such Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall count
as an Underwritten Shelf Takedown demanded by such Holder for purposes of
_subsection 2.1.3_. Following the receipt of any Withdrawal Notice, the
Company shall promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice to any other Holders
that had elected to participate in such Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be
responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Shelf
Takedown prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.5_, other than if
a Demanding Holder elects to pay such Registration Expenses pursuant to the
second sentence of this _subsection 2.1.5_.

2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

 

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company or any Holder proposes to conduct
a registered offering of, or if the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity
securities of the Company, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities of the Company, for
its own account or for the account of shareholders of the Company (or by the
Company and by the shareholders of the Company including, without limitation,
an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof), other than
a Registration Statement (or any registered offering with respect thereto) (i)
filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii)
for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Companys
existing shareholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into
equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan,
then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed offering to all
of the Holders of Registrable Securities (including for the avoidance of
doubt, the Management Holders) as soon as practicable but not less than 10
days before the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement or, in
the case of an underwritten offering pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the
launch date of such offering, which notice shall (A) describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any and if known, in such offering, and

 



8

    

 (B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to
include in such registered offering such number of Registrable Securities as
such Holders may request in writing within five days after receipt of such
written notice (such registered offering, a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). The
Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included
in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this
_subsection 2.2.1_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such
registered offering and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s)
of distribution thereof. The inclusion of any Holders Registrable Securities
in a Piggyback Registration shall be subject to such Holders agreement to
abide by the terms of Section 3.3 below.

 

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering that is to be a Piggyback
Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of the Common Stock or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell, taken together with (i)
the Common Stock or other equity securities, if any, as to which Registration
or a registered offering has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder (ii) the Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof, and (iii) the Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
separate written contractual piggyback registration rights of other
shareholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

(a) If the Registration or registered offering is undertaken for the
Companys account, the Company shall include in any such Registration or
registered offering (A) first, the Common Stock or other equity securities
that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to  _subsection 2.2.1_ hereof, _pro rata_ ,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other
equity securities, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to written contractual piggyback registration rights of other
shareholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities;

(b) If the Registration or registered offering is pursuant to a request by
persons or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the
Company shall include in any such Registration or registered offering (A)
first, the Common Stock or other equity securities, if any, of such
requesting persons or entities, other than the Holders of Registrable
Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable
Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their Registrable
Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_ , _pro rata_ based on the number of
Registrable Securities that 

 



9

    

 each Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other equity securities
that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B)
and (C), the Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other
persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to
separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

 

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal._ Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration or, in the case of a Piggyback Registration pursuant to
a Shelf Registration, the filing of the applicable "red herring" prospectus
or prospectus supplement with respect to such Piggyback Registration used for
marketing such transaction. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons pursuant
to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration
Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a Piggyback
Registration (which, in no circumstance, shall include the Shelf) at any time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible
for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback
Registration prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3._  

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights._ For purposes of clarity,
subject to subsection 2.1.5, any Piggyback Registration effected pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof shall not be counted as a demand for an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown under _subsection 2.1.3_ hereof.

 

2.3 _Restrictions on Transfer_. In connection with any Underwritten
Offering of equity securities of the Company, each Holder that holds more
than 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, agrees that it shall not
transfer any Common Stock (other than those included in such offering pursuant
to this Agreement), without the prior written consent of the Company, during
the seven days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on the date of pricing
of such offering, except in the event the Underwriter managing the offering
otherwise agrees by written consent. Each Holder agrees to execute a
customary lock-up agreement in favor of the Underwriters to such effect (in
each case on substantially the same terms and conditions as all such Holders).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an Underwritten Offering, a
Holder shall not be subject to this Section 2.3 with respect to an
Underwritten Offering unless each shareholder of the Company that (together
with their Affiliates) hold at least 10% of the issued and outstanding Common
Stock and each of the Companys directors and officers have executed a lock-up
on terms at least as restrictive with respect to such Underwritten Offering as
requested of the Holders. A Holders obligations under the second sentence of
this Section 2.3 shall only apply for so long as such Holder (together with
its Affiliates) holds at least 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock.

keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the
intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its best

that the Registrable Securities are exempt from such registration
or qualification) and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered

Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to
general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then otherwise so subject;

 



11

    

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on
each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed;

 

3.1.6 provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and
registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective
date of such Registration Statement;

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it
shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop
order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose
and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

 

3.1.8 at least five days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into
such Registration Statement or Prospectus furnish a draft thereof to each
seller of such Registrable Securities or its counsel (excluding any exhibits
thereto and any filing made under the Exchange Act that is to be incorporated
by reference therein);

 

3.1.9 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_
hereof;

3.1.10 permit representatives of the Holders , the Underwriters, if any,
and any attorney, consultant or accountant retained by such Holders or
Underwriter to participate, at each such persons own expense, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause the Companys officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or
Underwriters agree to confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such information;

 

3.1.11 obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Companys independent
registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Offering which
the participating Holders may rely on, in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as the
managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority-in-interest of the participating Holders;

 

3.1.12 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters
, if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the Registration in
respect of which such opinion is being given as the Holders, placement agent,
sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are customarily
included in such opinions and negative assurance letters, and
reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the participating
Holders;

 



12

    

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

 

3.1.14 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months
beginning with the first day of the Companys first full calendar quarter
after the effective date of the Registration Statement which satisfies the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11(a)_ of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission);

3.1.15 if an Underwritten Offering involves Registrable Securities with a
total offering price (including piggyback securities and before deduction of
underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $35.0
million, use its reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of
the Company to participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be
reasonably requested by the Underwriter in such Underwritten Offering; and

 

3.1.16 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

3.2 _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the Holders
that the Holders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the
sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters commissions
and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as
set forth in the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

 

3.3 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Holder
does not provide the Company with its requested Holder Information, the
Company may exclude such Holders Registrable Securities from the applicable
Registration Statement or Prospectus if the Company determines, based on the
advice of counsel, that such information is necessary to effect the
registration and such Holder continues thereafter to withhold such
information. No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration hereunder unless such
person (i) agrees to sell such persons securities on the basis provided in
any underwriting and other arrangements approved by the Company in the case of
an Underwritten Offering initiated by the Company, and the Demanding Holders
in the case of an Underwritten Offering initiated by the Demanding Holders and
(ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary
documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements. Subject to the minimum thresholds set forth in Section 2.1.3
and 3.1.15 of this Agreement, the exclusion of a Holders Registrable
Securities as a result of this Section 3.3 shall not affect the registration
of the other Registrable Securities to be included in such Registration. 

3.4 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains
a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a

 



13

    

 supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any
time would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require
the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Companys control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than 45 days, determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for
such purpose; provided that such right to delay or suspend shall be exercised
by the Company not more than two times, which may be consecutive, in any
12-month period. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration
of any period during which it exercised its rights under this Section 3.4.

 

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to
Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the
Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings; provided that any
documents publicly filed or furnished with the Commission pursuant to the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System shall be deemed to
have been furnished or delivered to the Holders pursuant to this Section 3.5.

 

3.6 _Other Obligations_. In connection with a sale or transfer of
Registrable Securities exempt from Section 5 of the Securities Act or through
any broker-dealer transactions described in the plan of distribution set forth
within the Prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of which such
Prospectus forms a part, the Company shall, subject to the receipt of the any
customary documentation required from the applicable Holders in connection
therewith, (i) promptly instruct its transfer agent to remove any restrictive
legends applicable to the Registrable Securities being sold or transferred
and (ii) cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if
any, to the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under subclause
(i). In addition, the Company shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection
with the aforementioned sales or transfers; provided, however, that the
Company shall have no obligation to participate in any "road shows" or
assist with the preparation of any offering memoranda or related
documentation with respect to any sale or transfer of Registrable Securities
in any transaction that does not constitute an Underwritten Offering.

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

 

4.1 _Indemnification_.

 

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are
caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company
by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

 

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus (the " _Holder Information_ ") and, to the extent permitted by
law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and
each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) resulting from any
untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the
extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use
therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be
several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities,
and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in
proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The
Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their
officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing
with respect to indemnification of the Company.

 

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent
such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii)
unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to
such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such
claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such
defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent
(but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party
who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of
interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No

 



15

    

 indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot
be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of
such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an
offering also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by
any indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Companys or such Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ hereof
from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying partys
and indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1, 4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_
above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any
other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of _Section_ __ _ 11(f)_ of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

holders of any Lion Holder pursuant to a distribution as described in Section

to such Holder, a Holder may assign or delegate such Holders rights, duties
or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to (a) up to

Transferee holds, after giving effect to such assignment or delegation, at

pursuant to a distribution as described in Section 5.12 of this Agreement or
(d) any person with the prior written consent of the Company.

Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ hereof.

agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,

5.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (including facsimile or PDF counterparts), each of which shall

5.4 _Governing Law; Venue_. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT

THAT (I) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF

ENTERED INTO AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO

ACTION TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT
IN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

 

5.5 _TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY 

 



19

    

 MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

5.6 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the
Company and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question as determined in good faith by the Company,
compliance with any of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in
this Agreement may be waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or
conditions may be amended or modified; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects
one Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock
of the Company, in a manner that is materially different from the other
Holders (in such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder so
affected. No course of dealing between any Holder or the Company and any other
party hereto or any failure or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company
in exercising any rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of any rights or remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or
partial exercise of any rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party
shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or
remedies hereunder or thereunder by such party.

 

5.7 _Other Registration Rights_. Other than the registration rights
conferred in certain subscription agreements with respect to equity
securities of the Company to be issued on the Closing Date, the Company
represents and warrants that no person, other than a Holder of Registrable
Securities, has any right to require the Company to register any securities
of the Company for sale or to include such securities of the Company in any
Registration Statement filed by the Company for the sale of securities for its
own account or for the account of any other person. Further, the Company
represents and warrants that this Agreement supersedes any other registration
rights agreement or agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the
event of a conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

5.8 _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the Holders the
benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, the Company
covenants that it will (x) make available information necessary to comply with
Rule 144, if available with respect to resales of the Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act, at all times, and (y) take such further action as
the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable them to sell Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act (if available with respect to resales
of the Registrable Securities), as such rule may be amended from time to time.
Upon the reasonable request of the Holders, the Company will deliver to it a
written statement as to whether they have complied with such information
requirements, and, if not, the specific reasons for non-compliance.

 

5.9 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate with respect to any Holder on
the date that such Holder no longer holds any Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that if after such termination, a Holder is issued Earnout
Shares (as defined in the BCA) in accordance with the terms of the BCA, such
Earnout Shares shall be treated as Registrable Securities under this
Agreement and such Holder shall be entitled to all of the rights under this
Agreement with respect to such Earnout Shares. The provisions of Section 3.5
and Article IV shall survive any termination.

 



20

    

5.10 _Holder Information_. Each Holder agrees, if requested in writing,
to represent to the Company the total number of Registrable Securities held by
such Holder in order for the Company to make determinations hereunder,
including, without limitation, for purposes of Section 5.8 hereof.

 

5.11 _Restatement_. Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the BCA, the Original RSRA is no longer of any force or effect.

5.12 _Distributions._

 

5.12.1 In the event that any Lion Holder distributes, or has distributed,
all of its Registrable Securities to its direct and/or indirect equity
holders, such distributees shall be treated as a Lion Holder hereunder;
_provided_ that only the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
held by all such distributees, as determined in good faith by the Company,
shall be entitled to take any action under this Agreement that such Lion
Holder is entitled to take, _provided_ , _further_ , that such distributees,
taken as a whole, shall not be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred
to the applicable Lion Holder, as if it remained a single entity party to
this Agreement.

5.12.2 In the event that the Sellers Shareholders distribute, or have
distributed, all of their Registrable Securities to their direct and/or
indirect equity holders, such distributees shall be treated as the Sellers
Shareholders hereunder; _provided_ that only the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by all such distributees, as determined in good
faith by the Company, shall be entitled to take any action under this
Agreement that the Sellers Shareholders are entitled to take, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such distributees, taken as a whole, shall not be entitled to
rights in excess of those conferred to the Sellers Shareholders, as if they
remained a single party to this Agreement.

 

5.13 _Adjustments_. If, and as often as, there are any changes in the
Common Stock by way of stock split, stock dividend, combination or
reclassification, or through merger, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or sale, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the provisions of this Agreement, as may be required, so that
the rights, privileges, duties and obligations hereunder shall continue with
respect to the Common Stock as so changed.

Exhibit D

 

Lock-Up Agreement

 

 _LOCK-UP AGREEMENT _

 

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of [●], 2019 by and between (a) Chuck E. Cheese Brands Inc., a Delaware
corporation (including any predecessor or successor entity thereto, the "
_Company_ ") and (b) AP VIII CEC Holdings, L.P., Delaware limited partnership
(" _AP VIII_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement will have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Business
Combination Agreement, dated as of April [●], 2019, by and among the Company,
Queso Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, AP VIII, and solely for purposes
of Section 7.14(f) thereof, Leo Investors Limited Partnership, a Cayman
limited partnership (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _BCA_ "). AP VIII and any person or entity who hereafter becomes a
party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 1 are referred to herein,
individually, as a "Holder" and, collectively, as the "Holders." 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the BCA, and in view of the valuable consideration to be
received by the parties thereunder, the parties desire to enter into this
Agreement, pursuant to the Holders Leo Common Stock (the " _Restricted
Securities_ ") shall become subject to limitations on disposition as set forth
herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1. _Lock-Up Provisions_. 

(a) The Holders hereby agree not to, during the period commencing from the
Closing and through the earlier of (x) the one hundred and eightieth (180) day
anniversary of the date of the Closing and (y) the date after the Closing on
which the Company consummates a Change of Control (as defined in the BCA)
(the " _Lock-Up Period_"): (i) lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber,
donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Restricted
Securities, or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of the Restricted Securities, whether any such transaction described in
clauses (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Restricted
Securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise (any of the foregoing
described in clauses (i) or (ii), a " _Prohibited Transfer_ "); and _provided_
, for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict
any Holders right to cause the Company to file and cause to become effective
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission naming
such Holder as a selling securityholder (and to make any required disclosures
on Schedule 13D in respect thereof). The foregoing sentence shall not apply:

(A) to the transfer of any or all of the Restricted Securities by a _bona
fide_  gift or charitable contribution;

(B) to the transfer of any or all of the Restricted Securities to any
Permitted Transferee;

   

(C) to the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under
the Exchange Act for the transfer of Restricted Securities; _provided_ , that
such plan does not provide for the transfer of Restricted Securities during
the Lock-Up Period; and

(D) with respect to voting rights pursuant to the execution and delivery
of a support, voting or similar agreement in connection with a Change of
Control;

_provided_ , _however_ , that in any of cases (A) or (B), it shall be a
condition to such transfer that the transferee executes and delivers to the
Company an agreement stating that the transferee is receiving and holding the
Restricted Securities subject to the provisions of this Agreement applicable
to such holder, and there shall be no further transfer of such Restricted
Securities except in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in any of the of cases (A) or (B) such transfer or distribution shall
not involve a disposition for value.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Permitted Transferee_ " shall mean:

(i) as a distribution to the direct or indirect general partners, limited
partners, shareholders, members of, or owners of similar equity interests in a
Holder; or

 

(ii) any affiliate of AP VIII.

 

The Holders further agree to execute such agreements as may be reasonably
requested by the Company that are consistent with the foregoing or that are
necessary to give further effect thereto.

(b) If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the
provisions of this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be null
and void ab initio, and the Company shall refuse to recognize any such
purported transferee of the Restricted Securities as one of its equity holders
for any purpose. In order to enforce this Section 1, the Company may impose
stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Restricted Securities (and
permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-
Up Period.

(c) During the Lock-Up Period, each certificate or book-entry position
evidencing any Restricted Securities shall be marked with a legend in
substantially the following form, in addition to any other applicable legends:

 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET
FORTH IN A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF [●], 2019, BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER
OF SUCH SECURITIES AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF THE SHARES (OR THE PREDECESSOR
IN INTEREST TO THE SHARES). A COPY OF SUCH LOCK-UP AGREEMENT WILL
BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN
REQUEST."

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, each Holder shall retain all of its rights
as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Securities
during the Lock-Up Period, including the right to vote any Restricted
Securities that are entitled to vote. The Company agrees to (i) instruct its
transfer agent to remove the legends in clause (c) immediately above upon the
expiration of the Lock-Up Period and (ii) cause its legal counsel to deliver
the necessary legal opinions, if any, to the transfer agent in connection with
the instruction under subclause (i).

2. _Miscellaneous_. 

 

(a) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto

obligations of a Holder are personal to such Holder and may not be transferred
or delegated at any time.

 

(b) _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the

have been executed for the benefit of, any person or entity that is not a
party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a party. 

(c) _Governing Law; Venue_. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT
MAY BE EXECUTED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE
THAT (I) ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY,

ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND (II) THE VENUE FOR ANY
ACTION TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT

(d) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT

nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa; (ii)
"including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including without
limiting the generality of any description preceding or succeeding such
term and shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without

(g) _Amendments and Waivers_. Only upon the approval by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company then in office that qualify
as "independent" for purposes of audit committee membership under Section
10A-3 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, compliance with any of
the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be
waived by the Company, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may
be amended or modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one
Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of Restricted Securities, shall
require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing between
any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay
on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or remedies
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of
any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or preclude
the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder by such
party.

 

(h) _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

 



5

    

(i) _Specific Performance_. Each Holder acknowledges that its obligations
under this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by such Holder, money damages will be inadequate and
the Company will have no adequate remedy at law, and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by such Holder in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Company shall be
entitled to an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by a Holder and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other security or to prove
that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to any other
right or remedy to which such party may be entitled under this Agreement, at
law or in equity.

 

(j) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject
matter hereof existing between the parties is expressly canceled; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not affect the rights
and obligations of the parties under the BCA or any documents related thereto
or referred to therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit any of the rights or remedies of the Company or any of
the obligations of any of the Holders under any other agreement between any of
the Holders and the Company or any certificate or instrument executed by any
of the Holders in favor of the Company, and nothing in any other
agreement, certificate or instrument shall limit any of the rights or
remedies of the Company or any of the obligations of any of the Holders under
this Agreement.

 

(k) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at another partys request
and without further consideration (but at the requesting partys reasonable
cost and expense), each party shall execute and deliver such additional
documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(l) _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may also be executed and
delivered by facsimile signature or by other electronic means in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Surviving Company Certificate of Incorporation

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

CHUCK E. CHEESE BRANDS INC.





 

FIRST: The name of the corporation is Chuck E. Cheese Brands Inc. (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Corporation_ "). 

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be located at 1209
Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801. The name of its
registered agent at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 600,000,000 of which 500,000,000
shares shall be Common Stock of the par value of $0.0001 per share and
100,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock of the par value of $0.0001 per
share.

 

A. _Preferred Stock_. The board of directors of the Corporation (the "
_Board of Directors_ ") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the
Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to establish from time to time the
number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix for each such
series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights and such
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors
providing for the issue of such series and included in a certificate of
designation (a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ ") and as may be permitted by
the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class,
without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series
thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any
Preferred Stock Designation.

 

B. _Common Stock_. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise
provided in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock
shall exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock
shall have one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to
the stockholders on which the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of
Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class
with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant
to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). The holders of the
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights. 

FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

 

A. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the Bylaws of the
Corporation (as they may be amended from time to time, the " _Bylaws_ ") so
provide.

B. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock
to elect additional directors under specified circumstances and the terms and
conditions of the Director Nomination Agreement by and among the Corporation,
AP VIII CEC Holdings, L.P. (" _AP VIII_ ") and Leo Investors Limited
Partnership (the " _Leo_

   

  _Sponsor_ "), dated as of [ ], 2019 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its
terms, the " _Director Nomination Agreement_ "), the number of directors which
shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be not less than five (5) nor
more than eleven (11). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock and the terms and conditions of the Director Nomination
Agreement, the exact number of directors shall be fixed from time to time,
within the limits specified herein, by the Board of Directors. 

C. Except as the DGCL or the Director Nomination Agreement may otherwise
require, in the interim between annual meetings of stockholders or special
meetings of stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the
removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that
connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies on the Board of
Directors, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of
directors, may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the
sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration
of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been
elected and qualified. A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy
resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director or a newly
created directorship shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual
meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor shall have been elected
and qualified.

 

D. Any director may be removed from office with or without cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the then outstanding shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Director Nomination Agreement, in
case the Board of Directors or any one or more directors should be so
removed, new directors may be elected at the same time for the unexpired
portion of the full term of the director or directors so removed.

 

E. Except as may be otherwise specifically required by law, this
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, unanimous attendance of all directors then
serving on the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, shall
be required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that attendance at such meeting by a majority of the
entire Board of Directors (meaning the total number of authorized directors
whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously
authorized directorships) or by a majority of the members of such committee
shall constitute a quorum (a " _Majority Quorum Standard_ ") (x) if at least
one director designated by Leo Sponsor (a "Leo Director") and at least one
director designated by AP VII (a "AP VIII Director") is present at such
meeting (provided that, in the case of a committee, the presence of a Leo
Director or AP VIII Director, as applicable, shall not be required for the
application of a Majority Quorum Standard if a Leo Director or AP VIII
Director, as applicable, is not a member of such committee and, in any case,
the presence of a Leo Director or AP VIII Director, as applicable, shall not
be required for the application of a Majority Quorum Standard if the Leo
Sponsor or AP VIII (or its successors or assigns), as applicable, no longer
has a right to designate any directors pursuant to the Director Nomination
Agreement) (y) if all Leo Directors or AP VIII Directors, as applicable, then
on the Board of Directors or such committee and not present at such meeting
have recused themselves from such meeting by informing the Corporation in
writing that they will not attend such meeting and that they consent to a
quorum without their presence and (z) from and after the time that neither
the Leo Sponsor nor AP VIII (or its successors or assigns) no longer have a
right to designate any directors pursuant to the Director Nomination
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if a quorum shall not be present at
any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof (an "
_Adjourned Meeting_ ") because either no Leo Director or no AP VIII Director
is present and all Leo Director(s) or AP VIII Director(s), as applicable (in
the case of a committee, who are members of the committee at the time of the
Adjourned Meeting), had received written notice of the time and place of such
Adjourned Meeting in accordance with Section 3.4 (or any successor provision)
of the Bylaws, the Majority Quorum Standard shall apply to a subsequent
meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee if such meeting is duly
called in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Bylaws (or any successor
provision) and relates solely to the same or similar matters that were to be
addressed at the Adjourned Meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors taken at a meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of
the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the
Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, a majority of the directors
present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice,
other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

F. The Board of Directors shall have the power, without the assent or vote
of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the
Bylaws.

 



2

    

G. The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for
approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act
or contract, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any contract or act
that shall be approved or be ratified by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereon
(provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person
or by proxy) shall be as valid and binding upon the Corporation and upon all
the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would
otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interests, or for any
other reason.

 

H. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this Certificate of Incorporation, and to any Bylaws from time
to time made by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Bylaw so
made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been
valid if such Bylaw had not been made.

 

I. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock,
any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
such holders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

 

J. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article FIFTH, any
director elected pursuant to the right, if any, of the holders of Preferred
Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances shall serve
for such term or terms and pursuant to such other provisions as specified in
the relevant Preferred Stock Designation.

 

SIXTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a person who serves as
a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or
modification of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal
or modification.

 

SEVENTH: A. Unless the Board of Directors consents in writing to the selection
of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial
owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of
the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation or current or former stockholder of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting
a claim against the Corporation, its current or former directors, officers,
employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or
this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting
a claim against the Corporation, its current or former directors, officers,
employees or stockholders governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except
for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

 

B. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if any action the subject matter
of which is within the scope of paragraph A immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to
have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action
brought in any such court to enforce paragraph A immediately above (an " _FSC
Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of process made upon such
stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

 



3

    

C. If any provision or provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or
circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any
other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article SEVENTH
(including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article
SEVENTH containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or
entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this Article SEVENTH.

 

EIGHTH: A. The Corporation elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the
DGCL.

 

B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not engage in any
business combination (as defined below) with any interested stockholder (as
defined below) for a period of three (3) years following the time that such
stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: (i) prior to such time,
the Board of Directors approved either the business combination or the
transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the

consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to ten (10)
or more persons; or (3) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for
the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a
revocable proxy or consent as described in item (b) of subsection (2)

any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a business
combination between the Corporation and such stockholder, have been an
interested stockholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership;

(ii) the business combination is proposed prior to the consummation or

D.(ii) of Article EIGHTH; (2) is with or by a person who either was not an
interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an
interested stockholder with the approval of the Board of Directors; and (3)
is approved or not opposed by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors then in office (but not less than one) who were directors prior to
any person becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years
or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a
majority of such directors. The proposed transactions referred to in the
preceding sentence are limited to (x) a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation (except for a merger in respect of which, pursuant to Section

(iii) the Corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is: (1)
listed on a national securities exchange; or (2) held of record by more than
2,000 stockholders, unless any of the foregoing results from action taken,

which a person becomes an interested stockholder.

 

NINTH: A. The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous
doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its
directors (other than directors that are employees of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries) in circumstances where the application of any such
doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict with any fiduciary duties
or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Certificate
of Incorporation or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine
of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity
with respect to any of the directors of the Corporation (other than directors
that are employees of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) unless such
corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity
as a director of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation
is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be
reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

 

B. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, each of the stockholders and directors of the Corporation, their
respective affiliates and all of their respective partners, principals,
directors, officers, members, managers, equity holders and/or employees,
including any of the foregoing who serve as directors or officers of
the Corporation (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries and other
than directors that are employees of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries) (each, an " _Exempted Person_ ") shall not have any fiduciary
duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar
business activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise expressly provided in any agreement entered
into between the Corporation and such Exempted Person. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in,
business opportunities that are from time to time available to the Exempted
Persons, even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its
subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or
desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and each such Exempted
Person shall have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to
the Corporation (and there shall be no restriction on the Exempted Persons
using the general knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the
Corporation operates which it has gained as an Exempted Person in considering
and pursuing such opportunities or in making investment, voting, monitoring,
governance or other decisions relating to other entities or securities) and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no Exempted Person shall be
liable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders for
breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or otherwise, by reason
of the fact that such Exempted Person pursues or acquires such business
opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to
present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business
opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries, or uses such knowledge
and understanding in the manner described herein, in each case, except (i) as
otherwise expressly provided in any agreement entered into between the Company
and such Exempted Person and (ii) for such opportunities offered to a person
solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation. In
addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporate opportunity shall
not be deemed to belong to the Corporation if it is a business opportunity
that the Corporation is not financially able or contractually permitted or
legally able to undertake, or that is, from its nature, not in the line of the
Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to it or that is one
in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable expectancy. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of
this Article NINTH.

C. Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article NINTH
shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the outstanding voting
stock. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
Article NINTH, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with
this Article NINTH, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article NINTH
in

 



7

    

 respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter
occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article
NINTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition,
repeal or adoption. This Article NINTH shall not limit any protections or
defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any
director or officer of the Corporation under this Certificate
of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law.

TENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL; and all rights, preferences
and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Preferred Stock Designation) in its present form or as hereafter amended are
granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TENTH. In the event
that the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation and the Director
Nomination Agreement conflict, the provisions of the Director Nomination
Agreement shall take precedence over this Certificate of Incorporation.

 

ELEVENTH: The Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of eighty-five percent of the voting power of all of the
then outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting
together as a single class, adopt any stockholder rights plan or similar plan
or agreement (or amend or modify any such plan or agreement) or adopt or
approve any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, in
each case, the purpose or reasonably evident effect of which is to (x)
restrict or limit an Exempted Persons (as defined in Article EIGHTH) ability
to transfer capital stock of the Corporation or (y) impose on a transferee of
an Exempted Person, or cause such transferee to incur or suffer, material
economic detriment (including through disproportionate dilution, relative to
other holders of capital stock of the Corporation, or through a requirement
to purchase or otherwise acquire, or offer to acquire, additional equity
securities of the Corporation in the form of a mandatory offer requirement or
similar provision) as a result of its receipt or continued ownership of
capital stock of the Corporation or other equity securities of the Corporation
transferred to it, and any such adoption or approval, without such affirmative
vote, shall be null and void _ab initio_ , and of no force or effect; 
_provided_ , _however_ , such vote shall not be required if such adoption or
approval has been approved by (A) Leo Sponsor, if Leo Sponsor, together with
its affiliates, is then a beneficial owner of 5% or more of the voting stock
(as defined in Article EIGHTH of this Certificate of Incorporation) of the
Corporation, (B) AP VIII, if AP VIII is then a beneficial owner of 5% or more
of the voting stock (as defined in Article EIGHTH of this Certificate of
Incorporation) of the Corporation, and (C) any other person included in
subsection (B) of the definition of Exempted Person, if such person is then a
beneficial owner of 5% or more of the voting stock (as defined in Article
EIGHTH of this Certificate of Incorporation) of the Corporation; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this Article ELEVENTH shall be of no further force and effect
at such time as no person included in subsection (A) or (B) of the definition
of Exempted Person is then the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the voting
stock (as defined in Article EIGHTH of this Certificate of Incorporation) of
the Corporation.

 

TWELFTH: The name and mailing address of the incorporator of this Corporation
is: [●].

 

THIRTEENTH: When the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws
refer to a specific agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Director Nomination Agreement) or other document (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Bylaws) or a decision by anybody or person that determines the
meaning or operation of a provision hereof or thereof, the Secretary of
the Corporation shall maintain a copy of such agreement, document or decision
at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and a copy thereof shall
be provided free of charge to any shareholder who makes a request therefor.

 

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, being the incorporator, for the purpose of forming a
corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware do make, file and record
this Certificate of Incorporation, do certify that the facts herein stated are
true, and, accordingly, have hereto set my hand this day of

by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series
of the Corporations stock shall be in uncertificated form. Stock certificates
shall be in such forms as the Board of Directors may prescribe and signed by
or in the name of the Corporation by any two of the Chief Executive Officer, a
Vice President, the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer, an
Assistant Treasurer or any other authorized officers of the Corporation,
certifying the number of shares owned by him or her.

5.2 _Signatures_. Any or all of the signatures on a stock certificate may
be a facsimile, including, but not limited to, signatures of officers of the
Corporation and countersignatures of a transfer agent or registrar. In case an
officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may
be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were
such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

5.3 _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new stock
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any stock certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new stock certificate, the Board of Directors
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or
her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation
with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

5.4 _Fixing Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the
Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which
record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a
later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If the Board does not fix a record date for any meeting of
the stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such meeting is
given, or, if notice is waived, the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in connection with
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for
any such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

(c) A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

5.5 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due presentment for transfer of
any share or shares, the Corporation shall treat the registered owner thereof
as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and to
all other benefits of ownership with respect to such share or shares, and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it
shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by
the laws of the State of Delaware.

ARTICLE VI

 

 _NOTICES_

 

6.1 _Form of Notice_. If mailed, notice to stockholders shall be deemed
given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be
given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by
electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.

6.2 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given under
the provisions of law or the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws
of the Corporation, a written waiver, signed by the person or persons entitled
to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular, or special meeting of the stockholders, Directors, or members of a
committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice
unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

ARTICLE VII

_INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_

7.1 To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as
may hereafter be amended, a person who serves as a director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time
of such repeal or modification.

 

7.2 To the fullest extent permitted by law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), the Corporation shall indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or officer of the Corporation, or while serving as a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including a subsidiary of the Corporation)
(any person in such a position, an " _Indemnified Person_ "), whether the
basis of such action, suit or proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director or officer of the

 



15

    

 Corporation or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer
of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ of these Bylaws
with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or
advancement, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnified Person in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnified
Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board
of Directors. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified
Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause
to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

7.3 The Corporation hereby acknowledges that an _Indemnified Person_ may
have certain rights to other indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance from persons other than the Corporation (collectively, the " _Other
Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation hereby agrees that with respect to any and
all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses and amounts
paid in settlement arising by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Person
is or was an Indemnified Person, (a) that the Corporation is the indemnitor
of first resort (i.e., its obligations to an Indemnified Person are primary
and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses, provide
indemnification or otherwise pay for the same amounts incurred by such
Indemnified Person are secondary), (b) that the Corporation shall be required
to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person in
accordance with this _Article VII_ and shall be liable for the full amount of
all amounts to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
these Bylaws (or any other agreement between the Corporation and an
Indemnified Person), without regard to any rights an Indemnified Person may
have against the Other Indemnitors, and, (c) that the Corporation irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all
claims against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees
that no advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an
Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Person
has sought indemnification or advancement from the Corporation shall affect
the foregoing and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or to be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of
the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Person against the Corporation. The
Corporation and each Indemnified Person agree that the Other Indemnitors are
express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this _Article VII_.

 

7.4 Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person
in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit or proceeding referenced in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or
she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this  _Section_ __ _
7.4_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors
and administrators.

 



16

    

7.5 Any repeal or amendment of this _Article VII_ or by changes in law, or
the adoption of any other provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or the
Bylaws inconsistent with this _Article VII_ , shall, unless otherwise required
by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification or advancement
rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in
any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the
time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision
in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first
threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of or related to any act or
omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision.

7.6 The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to the other sections of this _Article VII_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his
or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
such office.

 

7.7 The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnified Person against any
liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability under the provisions of this _Article VII_.

7.8 If a claim under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.4_ of these Bylaws is
not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has
been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an
advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20
days, the Indemnified Person may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by
the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses only upon a final
adjudication that, the Indemnified Person has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit
that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances
because the Indemnified Person has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including
its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
Indemnified Person has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the Indemnified Person has not met the applicable
standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnified
Person, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnified
Person to enforce a right to indemnification or to an 

 



17

    

 advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses, the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this _Article_ __ _ VI_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 

7.9 For purposes of this _Article VII_ , references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include
any service which imposes duties on, or involves services by, the Indemnified
Person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this _Article VII_.

 

7.10 The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this _Article VII_ shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be an Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 

7.11 The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnified Persons.

 

ARTICLE VIII

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

8.1 _Reliance on Books and Records_. Each Director, each member of any
committee designated by the Board of Directors, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each officer of the Corporation, shall, in the performance
of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the
books of account or other records of the Corporation, including reports made
to the Corporation by any of its officers, by an independent certified public
accountant, or by an appraiser selected with reasonable care.

 

8.2 _Inspection by Directors_. Any director shall have the right to
examine the Corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its
other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her
position as a director.

 

8.3 _Dividends_. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, if any, dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation
may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting,
pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of
the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out
of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as
the Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as
a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or
for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such
other purpose as the Directors shall think conducive to the interest of the
Corporation, and the Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the
manner in which it was created.

8.7 _Amendments_. Subject to the Director Nomination Agreement, the
original or other Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon at any regular or special meeting or, if
the Certificate of Incorporation so provides, by the Board of Directors. The
fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board of Directors shall
not divest the stockholders of the power nor limit their power to adopt, amend
or repeal these Bylaws.

 

8.8 _Interpretation of Bylaws_. All words, terms and provisions of these
Bylaws shall be interpreted and defined by and in accordance with the DGCL,
as amended, and as amended from time to time hereafter. In the event that the

provisions of the Director Nomination Agreement shall take precedence over
these Bylaws.
