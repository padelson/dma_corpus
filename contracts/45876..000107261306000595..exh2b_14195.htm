Set of Shares) and: ** __**

---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |

Working  Capital  is greater than the Estimated Net Working  Capital).

       (c)   |  

any  payments required to be made under the Financial Adjustment Provisions

Seller Obligation  or a Purchaser Obligation, it shall be made on the
following basis:

 

 

       (a)   |  

if  such payment relates directly to any particular Set of Shares (or  to
any  Target Company or Target Companies in a particular Relevant Target 
Group),  it shall so far as possible adjust the price paid for the relevant 
Shares  and, to the extent that the adjustment would otherwise reduce that 
price  below £1, it shall be treated in accordance with paragraph (b)  as 
if it were not so directly related;

paragraph (i) within 5 Business Days after a request by the  Sellers' 
Representative or the Purchaser to the other to do so: 

    
---|---

the  price paid for the Shares in Fourninezero Limited;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (B)   |  

to  the extent that the effect of clause 2.3(b)(ii)(A)  would otherwise be
to reduce the price paid for the Shares in Fourninezero  Limited below £1,
the price paid for each other Set of Shares on a pro  rata basis according to
the Final Price for each such Set of  Shares.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

2.4 Notwithstanding  any other provision of this agreement (including the
definition of Relevant  Target Group in Schedule 13 ),  to the  extent that
any External Debt, Cash, Net Working Capital, Intra-Group Payables  or Intra-
Group Receivables (each an **_Adjustment  Item_** )  is  attributable to
SMI Lorelev SAS, such Adjustment Item shall be allocated for  the  purposes
of apportioning the Final Price for the French Set of Shares between  the

as  to 54.6% of the amount of such Adjustment Item, to the Shares

being made (a  ** _third  party claim_** ),  the  Purchaser shall, subject
to clause 5.2:

 

 

       (a)   |  

promptly  (and in any event within 30 days of becoming aware of it) give
notice  of  such third party claim to the Sellers containing such details
as  the  Purchaser has available to it in respect of and, if available to 
the  Purchaser, as are sufficient to enable the Sellers to understand, 
the  nature and extent of the third party claim, provided that any failure 
by  the Purchaser to give such notice within such period shall not
prejudice  the right of the Purchaser to make a Claim in relation to such
third  party  claim (although this proviso shall be without prejudice to any
rights  for  breach of contract which the Sellers may have as a result of
such  failure);

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (b)   |  

not  make (and procure that each member of the Purchaser Group shall not 
make)  any admission of liability, agreement or compromise with any person, 
body  or authority in relation to that third party claim without prior 
written  approval of the Sellers' Representative (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed);

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

subject  to the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchaser Group
being  indemnified by the relevant Seller(s) against all reasonable out  of
pocket  costs and expenses incurred in respect of that third party claim 
(including any such costs and expenses incurred in performing its 
obligations under clause 5.3):

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

take  (and procure that each member of the Purchaser Group shall take) 
such  action as the relevant Seller(s) may reasonably request to avoid, 
resist,  dispute, appeal, compromise or defend such third party  claim;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |  

allow  (or, as appropriate, procure that the relevant member of the
Purchaser  Group shall allow) the relevant Seller(s) to take over the
conduct  of all  proceedings and/or negotiations of whatsoever nature
arising in connection  with the third party claim in question but on the
basis that the  relevant  Seller(s) shall not make any admission of
liability, agreement or  compromise with any person, body or authority in
relation to that  third  party claim without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser (such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
provided  that such  consent shall not be required if the relevant Seller(s)
have irrevocably  undertaken to the Purchaser to satisfy any amount payable
by the  Purchaser  or the relevant member of the Purchaser Group in
connection with  such  admission of liability, agreement or compromise); 
and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (iii)   |  

provide  (or procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall 
provide)  such information and assistance as the relevant Seller(s) may
reasonably  require in connection with the preparation for and conduct of
any  proceedings and/or negotiations relating to that third party  claim.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

5.2 Nothing  in clause 5.1  shall  oblige the Purchaser to take or to
procure that any other member of the  Purchaser Group shall take any action
or do anything which, in the reasonable  opinion of the Purchaser, is likely
to have a material adverse impact on the  reputation or goodwill of any of
the Target Companies or of any member of the  Purchaser Group. If the
relevant Seller(s) fails to indemnify the Purchaser  or  relevant member of
the Purchaser Group in accordance with clause 5.1(c)  in  respect of a third
party claim within 21 days after the Sellers have received  notice of such
third party claim containing sufficient details to enable the  Sellers to
understand the nature and extent of the third party claim, the  Purchaser
shall cease to have any obligations under clause 5.1  in  respect of that
third party claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.3 If  the  Purchaser makes a Claim against the Sellers or notifies the
Sellers of any  third  party claim which might lead to such a Claim being
made, the Purchaser  shall:

 

 

       (a)   |  

make  available to accountants and other representatives appointed by the 
relevant Seller(s) such access during normal business hours to the 
personnel, records and information of that Target Company as the  relevant 
Seller(s) reasonably request in connection with such Claim or third  party 
claim (including, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of  remedying 
such Claim); and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

to  the extent reasonably requested by the relevant Seller(s), use all 
reasonable endeavours to procure that the auditors (both past and  then 
current) of any relevant Target Company make available their audit  working 
papers in respect of audits of the accounts of that Target Company  for any 
accounting period relevant to such Claim or third party claim (subject  to 
the relevant Seller(s) first providing to such auditors a hold harmless 
letter in a form customarily required by such auditors as a condition  to 
making their audit working papers available to third  parties).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**6. ****No  Rights of Rescission or Termination**

 

 

The  Purchaser shall not be entitled to rescind or terminate this agreement
in any  circumstances whatsoever (whether before or after Closing), other
than pursuant  to any such rights which arise in respect of fraudulent

person  making the payment shall be obliged to pay the other person such

withholding.

 

 

11.4 If  any  tax authority brings into charge to tax any sum paid by a
person to any other  person under this agreement in respect of a Purchaser
Obligation or a Seller  Obligation, then, except in relation to interest, the

amount that would otherwise  have  been payable had the sum in question not
been so charged to tax.

pursuant to clause 11.3  or  clause 11.4  by such  other persons as the
Recipient, acting reasonably, certifies to the other  persons will leave it

been in if no deduction or withholding had been required  or  no tax charge
had arisen or (where applicable) if the matter giving rise to  the  payment
had not arisen.

this agreement  in  accordance with the provisions of clause 21,  the

no such assignment taken  place.

 

 

11.7 For  the  avoidance of doubt, clauses 11.3  to 11.6  shall  not
apply to the Final Price for any Set of Shares, any Financial Adjustments

Page  20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25.3 Each  Seller agrees that its rights under this agreement where action is
required  by  the Sellers' Representative, other than the rights of the
Sellers under clause 25.2,  may  only be exercised on its behalf by the
Sellers' Representative and that any such  exercise by a Seller on its own
behalf shall be of no effect. Any provision  of  this agreement which
requires or provides for any act or performance by the  Sellers'
Representative shall be deemed to include an undertaking by the Sellers  to
procure that the Sellers' Representative shall promptly carry out such act
or  performance.

 

 

25.4 Each  of  the Sellers hereby agrees and declares that any consent,
notice, document,  deed,  matter and thing which is given, made, executed or
done by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this agreement shall be as
good, valid and effectual  as if the same had been given, made, executed or

the Sellers' Representative may  lawfully do or cause to be done pursuant to
this agreement.

 

 

25.5 The  Purchaser shall be entitled at any time to rely on any written

Sellers' Representative as to  matters relating to this agreement without
enquiry. The Sellers hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably authorise the

all such acts or documents as the  Sellers' Representative may in its
absolute discretion consider to be necessary  or desirable to give effect to
this agreement.

 

 

**26.** **Conflict  with other Agreements**

 

 

26.1 In  the  event of any conflict between this agreement and any other
agreement relating  to  the Proposed Transactions, this agreement shall
prevail (as between the parties  to this agreement and as between any other
members of the Sellers' Group, on the  one hand, and any other members of the
Purchaser Group, on the other)  unless:

 

 

       (a)   |  

such  other agreement expressly states that it (or any part of it)
overrides  this agreement in any respect and all of the Sellers and the
Purchaser  are  either also parties to that other agreement or the Sellers'
Representative  and the Purchaser otherwise expressly agree in writing that
such  other  agreement shall override this agreement in that respect;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

the  contrary is expressly provided elsewhere in this  agreement.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**27.** **Entire  Agreement**

 

 

27.1 This  agreement and the other Transaction Documents **** together  set
out the entire agreement and understanding between the parties in respect 
of  the sale and purchase of the Shares. This agreement and the other
Transaction  Documents supersede all prior agreements, understandings or
arrangements  (whether oral or written) relating to the sale

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  purchase of the Shares, which prior agreements, understandings and
arrangements  shall cease to have any further force or effect. It is agreed
that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

no  party has entered into this agreement or any other Transaction Document 
in  reliance upon, nor shall any party have any claim or remedy in respect 
of,  any statement (including any statement of intent or opinion), 
representation, warranty, promise, forecast, estimate, projection, 
undertaking, assurance, collateral contract or other provision made  or 
provided by or on behalf of any other party (or any of its Connected 
Persons) which is not expressly set out in this agreement or any  other 
Transaction Document;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

any  terms or conditions which may be implied by law in any jurisdiction 
in  relation to the Proposed Transactions shall be excluded or, if
incapable  of exclusion, any rights or remedies in relation to them shall
be  irrevocably waived;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

the  only right or remedy of a party in relation to any statement, 
representation, warranty, undertaking, assurance, collateral contract  or 
other provision set out in this agreement or any other Transaction  Document
shall be for breach of this agreement or the relevant Transaction  Document
(including damages or injunctive relief in respect thereof)  to  the
exclusion of all other rights and remedies;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

except  for any liability which a party (or any of its Connected Persons) 
has  under or in respect of any breach of this agreement or any of the 
other  Transaction Documents, no party (or any of its Connected Persons) 
shall  owe any duty of care __ or  have any liability in tort or otherwise
to any other party (or its  respective Connected Persons) in respect of,
arising out of, or in  any way  relating to the Proposed  Transactions,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

provided  that this clause shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy in
respect  of)  fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

 

The  agreements and undertakings in this clause 27  are  given and received
by each party on its own behalf and as agent for each of  its  Connected
Persons. Each party acknowledges that the other party gives and  receives
such agreements and undertakings as agent with the full knowledge  and 
authority of each of its Connected Persons. For the purpose of this clause, 
**_Connected  Persons_**   means  (in relation to a party) the officers,
employees, agents and advisers of that  party or any of its Affiliates.

 

 

**28.** **Waiver** **s,  Rights and Remedies**

 

 

Except  as  otherwise provided in this agreement, no failure or delay by any
party in  exercising any right or remedy provided by law or under or pursuant
to this  agreement or any other Transaction Document shall impair such right
or remedy  or  operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or
preclude its exercise  at any subsequent time and no single or partial
exercise of any such right  or  remedy shall preclude any further exercise
of it or the exercise of any other  remedy.

**29.** **General**

 

 

29.1 This  agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
parties  to it  on separate counterparts, each of which is an original but
all of which taken  together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

 

29.2 No  amendment, variation or waiver of this agreement (or of any of the
other  Transaction Documents) shall be valid unless it is in writing and duly
executed  by or on behalf of the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser.
The expression  ** _variation _** shall  include any variation, supplement,
deletion or replacement howsoever  effected.  Unless  expressly agreed, no
variation shall constitute a general waiver of any  provision of this
agreement, nor shall it affect any rights, obligations or  liabilities under
or pursuant to this agreement which have already accrued  up to  the date of
variation, and the rights and obligations under or pursuant to  this 
agreement shall remain in full force and effect except and only to the
extent  that they are so varied.

 

 

29.3 Each  of  the provisions of this agreement and the other Transaction
Documents is  severable. If any such provision is held to be or becomes
illegal, invalid  or  unenforceable in any respect under the law of any
jurisdiction:

 

 

       (a)   |  

so  far as it is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be given  no 
effect and shall be deemed not to be included in this agreement or  the 
relevant Transaction Document but it shall not affect or impair the 
legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any  other 
provisions of this agreement or the relevant Transaction Document  (or of 
the provisions of this agreement or other Transaction Document in  any 
other jurisdiction); and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

the  parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to replace it with a  valid
and  enforceable substitute provision or provisions but differing from 
the  replaced provision as little as possible and the effect of which  is
as  close to the intended effect of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable 
provision.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

29.4 A  person  who is not a party to this agreement shall have no right
under the Contracts  (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (or equivalent
legislation in any other  jurisdiction) to enforce any of its terms.

 

 

29.5 The  rights of the Purchaser under this agreement:

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  relation to Brambles France and the French Set of Shares are intended 
to  and shall benefit the French Principal which is a party to this
agreement  by virtue of the Purchaser having entered into it as agent of
the  French  Principal;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  relation to Brambles UK and the UK Set of Shares are intended to  and
shall  benefit the UK Principal which is a party to this agreement by
virtue  of  the Purchaser having entered into it as agent of the UK
Principal;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (c)   |  

in  relation to Brambles Holdings Europe and the Dutch Set of Shares  are 
intended to and shall benefit the Dutch Principal which is a party  to this 
agreement by virtue of the Purchaser having entered into it as agent  of 
the Dutch Principal,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

and  where  such rights are expressed to benefit any such person as
aforesaid all such  rights (including without limitation the right to bring a
claim for breach  of  the Warranties), may be enforced by such person
directly against the relevant  Seller to the fullest extent permissible by
law.

 

 

**30.** **Interpretation**

 

 

Words  and  expressions used in this agreement shall have the meanings set
out in Schedule 13   unless  the context requires otherwise.

 

 

**31.** **Settlement  of disputes**

 

 

31.1 In  the  event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
in connection  with  this agreement or any other Transaction Document other
than a dispute to which  Part C   of Schedule 12   applies  (a
**_Dispute_** ),  either  the Sellers or the Purchaser may serve formal
written notice on the other that  a  Dispute has arisen (a **_Notice  of
Dispute_** ).

 

 

31.2 The  Sellers and the Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours for a
period  of  twenty Business Days from the date on which the Notice of
Dispute is served  by  one party on the other party (or such longer period
as may be agreed in writing  between the parties) to resolve the Dispute on
an amicable basis.

 

 

31.3 If  the  parties are unable to resolve the Dispute by amicable
negotiation within the  time period referred to in clause 31.2,  the 
Dispute may be referred by the Sellers or the Purchaser to senior executives 
of  the Sellers' Group and the Purchaser Group nominated by the respective
Chief  Executive Officers of the Guarantor and the Purchaser who shall
attempt, for  a  period of ten Business Days from the expiry of the time
period referred to  in  clause 31.2,  to  resolve the Dispute. In the
event that those senior executives are unable to  resolve the Dispute within
the stated time period (or such longer period as  may  be agreed in writing
between the parties), the Dispute shall be referred to  arbitration in
accordance with clause 31.4.

 

 

31.4 Subject  to clauses 31.1  to 31.3,  the  Dispute shall be referred
to and finally resolved by arbitration under the  Rules  of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce by a sole arbitrator  appointed in
accordance with those Rules. **** The  seat  of arbitration shall be London,
England. The language to be used in the arbitral  proceedings shall be
English. The parties shall have the right to seek interim  relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction, at any time before and after  the 
arbitrator has been appointed, up until the arbitrator has made his final 
award.

       (a)   |  

Each  Seller has obtained all corporate authorisations and all other
applicable  governmental, statutory, regulatory or other consents,
licences,  authorisations, waivers or exemptions ( ** _Approvals_** ) 
required to empower it to enter into and perform its obligations  under 
this agreement and any other Transaction Document to which it is  a party 
where failure to obtain such Approval would adversely affect its  ability 
to enter into or perform its obligations under this agreement or  the other 
Transaction Documents in accordance with their  terms.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

This  agreement and the other Transaction Documents which are to be entered 
into  by each Seller will, when executed, constitute valid and binding 
obligations of that Seller.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

Entry  into and performance by each Seller of this agreement and/or any 
other  Transaction Document to which it is a party will not breach the
provisions  of its memorandum and articles of association, certificate of 
incorporation, by-laws or equivalent constitutional documents in  its 
jurisdiction of incorporation where such breach would adversely affect  its 
ability to enter into or perform its obligations under this agreement  and/or
any other Transaction Document to which it is a party in accordance  with
their terms.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

Neither  entry by each Seller into this agreement nor entry into, and 
implementation of, the Proposed Transactions by each Seller  will:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |

---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |

---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  39

---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

All  the Shares and all of the shares in each of the Subsidiaries are

A   of  Schedule 1 the  sole legal and beneficial owner, free from all

---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

No  member of the Sellers' Group nor any Target Company has entered into
any  agreement or arrangement (other than this agreement) pursuant to  which

of any share or loan capital in any Target  Company.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |

listed  in  column 2 of Part A   of  Schedule 1 .

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (f)   |  

The  information in respect of each of the Target Companies set out in  Part
A   of  Schedule 1   and (insofar as such information relates to the
identity of the  shareholders, directors or legal representatives of any
Target Company  or  to the share capital of any Target Company) in Part B  
and Part C   of  Schedule 1   is  complete and accurate.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (g)   |

Every  share in the capital of every Subsidiary is owned legally and 
beneficially, free from all Encumbrances, by a Target Company listed  in 
Part B of  Schedule 1   and no member of the Sellers' Group nor any Target

the right  (exercisable now or in the future and whether contingent or not) 
to call  for the issue, allotment, conversion or transfer of any share or 
loan  capital in any Subsidiary.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

No  member of the Sellers' Group provides any industrial services in Europe 
(including the United Kingdom) or North America which compete in  any 
material respect with (or which would, if carried on by a third party  in 
the same jurisdiction as the business of any of the Target Companies,  have 
the potential to compete in any material respect with) the industrial 
services provided by any Target  Company.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

1.3 **Other  interests**

 

 

No  Target  Company owns or has any interest of any nature whatsoever in any

all material respects  (save  to the extent required by law, any applicable

for all such Claims and not merely the  excess  over £1,000,000.

No  such  limit shall apply in relation to a Title Claim.

 

 

**3.** **Claim  to be withdrawn unless litigation commenced**

 

 

Any  Non-Tax Claim shall (if it has not been previously satisfied, settled
or  withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn unless legal proceedings in
respect  of it have been commenced by both being issued and served within
nine months  of  notice having been given by the Purchaser in accordance
with paragraph 1  of this Schedule 4   (except  where the Non-Tax Claim
relates to a contingent liability in which case it  shall  be deemed to have
been withdrawn unless legal proceedings in respect of it  have  been
commenced by

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  68

actual  liability). No new Non-Tax Claim may be made in respect of the facts,

The  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the only Warranties given in
relation  to:

 

 

       (a)   |  

taxation  or any related claims, liabilities or other matters ( ** _Tax 
Matters_** )  are those set out in Part D   of  Schedule 3   and each of
the other Warranties shall be deemed not to be given  in  relation to Tax
Matters; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

Environmental  Matters or any related claims, liabilities or other matters (

relation to any Claim for breach of the Warranty contained in  paragraph
8.1  of Part A   of Schedule 3 .

The  Sellers shall not be liable for any Non-Tax Claim if and to the extent
that  the  fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such Non-Tax
Claim is  disclosed, allowed, provided or reserved for in the June 30
Accounts or the  Closing Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**7.** **Contingent  liabilities**

 

 

If  any  Non-Tax Claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only,
the Sellers  shall not be liable to make any payment unless and until such
contingent  liability gives rise to an obligation to make a payment (but,
subject as  provided in paragraph 1 of this Schedule 4 ,  without 
prejudice to the right of the Purchaser to give notice of that Non-Tax Claim 
and  to issue and serve proceedings in respect of it before such time).

 

 

**8.** **No  liability for Non-Tax Claims arising from acts or omissions of 
Purchaser**

 

 

The  Sellers shall not be liable for any Non-Tax Claim which would not have
arisen  but for any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out:

 

 

       (a)   |  

after  the date of this agreement by the Purchaser or any member of the 
Purchaser  Group or its respective officers, employees or agents or
successors  in  title; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       **(b) **  |

member of the Purchaser Group.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**9.** **Nothing  to restrict Purchaser 's duty to mitigate**

 

 

Nothing  in this Schedule 4   shall in  any way restrict or limit the
general obligation at law of the Purchaser and,  following Closing, any
member of the Purchaser Group to mitigate any loss or  damage which it may
suffer in consequence of any breach by the Sellers of any  of  the
Warranties or any fact, matter, event or circumstance likely to give rise 
to  a Claim.

 

 

**10.** **Recovery  from third parties**

 

 

Where  the  Sellers have made a payment to the Purchaser in relation to any
Non-Tax Claim  and the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group has a
right of  reimbursement against any other person in respect of the subject
matter of  that  Non-Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall:

 

 

       (a)   |  

promptly  notify the Sellers of that fact;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

provide  (or procure that any relevant member of the Purchaser Group
provides)  such  information as the Sellers may reasonably require;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

take  (or procure that any relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall 
take)  all steps or proceedings as the Sellers may reasonably require to 
enforce  such right, provided that nothing in this paragraph 10  shall
oblige the Purchaser to take or to procure that any other member  of  the
Purchaser Group shall take any action or do anything which, in  the 
reasonable opinion of the Purchaser, is likely to have a material  adverse 
impact on the reputation or goodwill of any of the Target Companies  or of 
any member of the Purchaser Group.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group shall be reimbursed
any amount  in  respect of the subject matter of that Non-Tax Claim, the
Purchaser shall  immediately pay the Sellers an amount equal to the amount
reimbursed less any  reasonable costs of recovery. Thereafter, that Non-Tax
Claim shall be limited  (in addition to the limitations on the liability of
the Sellers referred to  in  this Schedule 4 )  to the  amount by which
the loss or damage suffered by the Purchaser as a result of  such  breach
exceeds the amount so recovered.

 

 

**11.** **Sums  or benefits received by Purchaser**

 

 

Without  prejudice to paragraph 10  of this Schedule 4 ,  this  paragraph
shall apply if the Sellers make any payment to the Purchaser in  relation to
any Non-Tax Claim (the **_Damages  Payment_** )  and the  Purchaser or any
member of the Purchaser Group receives any sum or benefit  otherwise than
from the Sellers or any member of the Sellers' Group (whether by  payment,
discount, credit, relief or otherwise including from any tax authority) 
which would not have been received but for the circumstance giving rise to 
that  Non-Tax Claim. The Purchaser shall (or shall procure that the relevant
member  of  the Purchaser Group shall), once it or the relevant member of
the Purchaser  Group has received such sum or benefit, immediately repay to
the Sellers an  amount  equal to such  sum  or benefit (net of taxation
thereon and reasonable costs of recovery) or, if  less, the Damages Payment
(except to the extent that the amount of such sum  or  benefit has been
taken into account in calculations in the Damages Payment  pursuant to clause
11.5).

 

 

**12.** **Claims  which would have been covered by Sellers ' insurance**

 

 

The  Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any Non-Tax Claim to the
extent that  the amount of such Non-Tax Claim is covered by any Insurance in
force at the  date of this agreement to the extent that such policy is a
"claims made" insurance rather than an "occurrence" insurance, and would have
continued to be  so covered if such Insurance, to the extent it was effected
by or for the  benefit of the Target Companies, had been maintained after
Closing on no less  favourable terms than those existing at the date of this
agreement.

 

 

**13.** **No  liability for legislation or changes in rates of tax**

 

 

The  Sellers shall not be liable for any Non-Tax Claim if and to the extent
it is  attributable to or the amount of such Non-Tax Claim is increased as a
result  of:

 

 

       _(a) _  |  

any  legislation not in force at the date of this  agreement;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       _(a) _  |  

any  change of law (or any change in interpretation on the basis of case 
law),  regulation, directive, requirement or administrative practice which 
takes  effect retroactively; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       _(b) _  |  

any  change in the rates of taxation in force at the date of this 
agreement.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**14.** **No  double recovery**

 

 

The  Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment, 
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one 
liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage, deficiency, breach or other set of 
circumstances which gives rise to more than one Claim.

 

 

**15.** **Purchaser 's  knowledge**

 

 

The  Sellers shall not be liable for any Claim if and to the extent that
the  Purchaser is actually aware at the date of this agreement:

 

 

       (a)   |  

of  the fact, matter, event or circumstance which is the subject matter  of
the  Claim; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

that  the fact, matter, event or circumstance could amount to a  Claim.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**16.** **Sellers  to have opportunity to remedy breaches**

 

 

A  breach  of the Warranties which is capable of remedy shall not entitle
the Purchaser  to  compensation unless the Sellers are given written notice
of the breach by the  Purchaser and such breach is not remedied within thirty
(30) days after the  date  on which such notice is served on the Sellers.

the  use or set-off of any Purchaser\'s relief in circumstances where,  but
for  such use or set-off, a Target Company would have had an actual

amount of  the actual liability to tax that is saved by the use or set-off
of  the  Purchaser's relief); provided that for the purposes of this
Schedule it  shall be assumed that reliefs other than any Purchaser's relief

respect of a  period commencing after Closing, an accounting period of the
Target Company  concerned shall be deemed to have ended on Closing.

 

 

1.5 In  this  Schedule, for the purposes of determining whether:

relation to tax other than Corporation Tax (or any penalties,  charges or
interest relating thereto or to any late or incorrect return in  respect
thereof), be treated as referring instead to the Closing Statement.  For 
the avoidance of doubt, therefore, any reference to the Accounts in
paragraph  14  shall  not be treated as referring instead to the Closing
Statement.

 

 

1.9 Where  there is any inconsistency between the provisions in this Schedule
and the  provisions elsewhere in this agreement, the provisions in this
Schedule shall  prevail for the purposes of construing this agreement.

 

 

1.10  Any  reference in this Schedule to income, profits or gains having
been earned,  accrued or received on or before a particular time or events

       (c)   |

allowances  purposes (or has any similar effect under the laws of any
relevant  jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom); 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

anything  which causes that Target Company to become liable to pay interest 
or  penalties in respect of tax; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (e)   |  

anything  which causes that Target Company to become liable to pay tax

1.12 The  Sellers shall not be entitled to recover any amount in respect of a
claim under  paragraph 4 (Overprovisions), paragraph 7 (Tax Refunds) or
paragraph 11  (Recovery from Third Parties/Savings) to the extent that a
Seller has already  recovered an amount under this Schedule in respect of the
same subject  matter.

 

 

**2.** **Covenant  to pay**

 

 

Each  of  the relevant Sellers hereby jointly and severally covenants with
the Purchaser  to pay to the Purchaser an amount equivalent to any tax
liability arising in  respect of, by reference to or in consequence of:

 

 

       (a)   |  

any  income, profits or gains earned, accrued or received on or before 
Closing;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

any  event which occurred on or before Closing (including, without
limitation,  Closing itself);

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

together  with any costs and expenses referred to in paragraph 5.

 

 

**3.** **Exclusions**

 

 

3.1 The  covenants contained in paragraph 2  shall  not cover any tax
liability to the extent that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

provision  or reserve in respect of that tax liability has been made in the 
Accounts  (including provision or reserve for payment in respect of a
Surrender  to  which the tax liability relates), or the tax liability was
taken  into  account in computing any asset in respect of tax appearing in
the  Accounts  or which, but for the presumed existence of such liability,
would  have  appeared in the Accounts; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

the  tax liability was paid or discharged before Closing, or such payment 
or  discharge was taken into account in computing any asset appearing  in
the  Accounts or which, but for the presumed payment or discharge, would 
have  appeared in the Accounts; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

the  tax liability arises as a result of any change in rates of tax made 
after  the Closing Date or of any change in law (or a change in
interpretation  on  the basis of case law), regulation, directive or
requirement, or  the  practice of any tax authority, occurring after the
Closing Date;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

the  tax liability would not have arisen but for a transaction, action  or 
omission carried out or effected by the Purchaser or any Target Company,  or
any other person connected with or related to any of them, at  any time 
after Closing, except that this exclusion shall not apply where any  such 
transaction, action or omission:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

is  carried out or effected by the Target Company concerned pursuant  to a 
legally binding commitment created on or before Closing;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  99  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (ii)   |  

is  carried out or effected by the Target Company concerned in the ordinary 
course of business of such Target Company  as carried on at Closing; or;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (e)   |  

the  tax liability arises as a result of a change after Closing in the 
length  of any accounting period for tax purposes of any Target Company,  or
a  change after Closing in any accounting policy or tax reporting practice 
of  any Target Company  (other than a change which is necessary in order to
comply with the  law or  generally accepted accounting principles applicable
to the relevant  Target  Company at Closing); or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (f)   |  

notice  of a claim in respect of the tax liability (other than a French
Seller  tax  liability) in a form complying with the provisions of 
paragraph 9.1  is  not given to the relevant Seller prior to the sixth
anniversary of  the end  of the accounting period of the Target Company
concerned in which  Closing  occurs, or (where the claim is not previously
settled, satisfied  or  withdrawn) proceedings in respect thereof are not
issued to and (to  the  extent possible) served upon the relevant Seller in
England within  the  nine-month period following such anniversary and
pursued with reasonable  diligence thereafter; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (g)   |  

notice  of a claim in respect of a French Seller tax liability in a form 
complying  with the provisions of paragraph 9.1 **** is  not given to the
French Seller prior to the date which is thirty  (30) days  after the end of
the third calendar year following the calendar year  in  which the recording
period of the relevant French Company ended;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (h)   |  

such  tax liability arises as a result of any Target Company failing to 
submit  the returns and computations required to be made by them or not
submitting  such returns and computations within the appropriate time
limits  or  submitting such returns and computations otherwise than on a
proper  basis,  in each case after Closing and otherwise than as a result of
any  default  or failure of the relevant Seller in carrying out, or in
failing  to carry  out, its obligations under paragraph 12;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

the  tax liability arises as a result of the failure of the Purchaser  to
comply  with its obligations contained in paragraph 9,  12  or  14 
hereof; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (j)   |  

any  relief other than a Purchaser's relief is available, or is for no 
consideration made available by any member of the Retained Group,  to any 
Target Company to set against or otherwise mitigate the tax liability  (and 
so that any relief that is so available in relation to more than  one tax 
liability to which this Schedule applies shall be deemed, so far  as 
possible, to be used in such a way as to reduce to the maximum extent 
possible the relevant Seller's total liability hereunder);  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (k)   |  

the  tax liability would not have arisen but  for:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  100  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (i)   |  

the  making of a claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, the giving  of
a  notice or consent, or the doing of any other thing under the provisions 
of  any enactment or regulation relating to tax, in each case after Closing 
and by the Purchaser or any Target Company, or any person connected  with 
or related to any of them, and otherwise than at the direction of  the 
relevant Seller pursuant to paragraph 12  or  in compliance with the
Purchaser\'s obligations under paragraph 12;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |  

the  failure or omission on the part of any Target Company after Closing 
(otherwise than at the direction of the relevant Seller pursuant  to 
paragraph 12)  to make any such valid claim, election, surrender or
disclaimer,  or to  give any such notice or consent or to do any other such
thing, either  as  the relevant Seller may validly require in respect of
periods or  matters  for which it has conduct under paragraph 12  or 
paragraph 14  or, in respect of periods or matters for which it does not have
conduct,  in circumstances where the making, giving or doing of which was
taken  into  account in the preparation of the Accounts and the need for the
making,  giving or doing of which is notified to the Purchaser in writing 
no less  than 30 days before the date on which it can be validly made,
given  or  done; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (l)   |  

the  tax liability arises in respect of, by reference to or in consequence 
of  any actual (as opposed to deemed) income, profits or gains earned, 
accrued  or received after Closing and which have not been taken into
account  in  the preparation of the Closing  Statement.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

3.2 The  French Seller shall have no liability under any part of this
agreement for  any  French Seller tax liability which would result from a
simple transfer of income  or expenses from one fiscal year to another, save
to the extent that it  comprises an amount in respect of interest or
penalties. For the avoidance  of  doubt, the French Seller shall remain
liable for any tax liability consisting  not only of interest and/or
penalties, including any corporate income tax  liability resulting from the
transfer of income and expenses from one fiscal  year to another which, under
section 38.4bis of the French general tax code  ( _code  g eneral des
impots_),  would  not result only in interest or penalties and any future
tax liability resulting  from the loss of the right to depreciate the full
value of a French Company's  assets.

 

 

3.3 The  Sellers shall have no liability to the Purchaser under any part of
this  agreement in respect of any non-availability, inability to use, or loss
or  restriction of any relief ( ** _failure  of relief_** )  where  such
failure of relief does not give rise to a tax liability to which  paragraph
2  applies.

 

 

3.4 The  tax  consequences of the exit of the French Companies from the
French Seller\'s French  tax group ( _int egration  fiscale_),  (including
with respect to tax adjustments ( _r eintegrations  de sortie de groupe_), 
indemnification for the loss of tax attributes, down-payment of taxes,
future  tax audits and reassessment of the taxable result of the French

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  101  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Companies  for the tax consolidated years) are governed by a tax group exit
agreement  ( _convention  de sortie d\'int egration fiscale_),  dated  the
same date as this agreement, by and between Brambles France SAS and the 
French Companies (the **_Tax  Group Exit Agreement_** ).  For  the
avoidance of doubt, it is specified that any payments in respect of Tax  or 
penalties that a French Company will have to make to Brambles France SAS or 
any  other member of the Retained Group pursuant to the Tax Group Exit
Agreement  will  constitute a tax liability to which the covenants to pay
and exclusions provided  for by paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof will be applicable.
It is further specified  that payments to be made post-Closing by the French
Companies to Brambles France  SAS pursuant to paragraph 15 hereof and to the
Tax Group Exit Agreement for  down-payment of Taxes do not constitute post-
Closing tax liabilities to which  paragraph 2 hereof would be applicable, and
that, as is provided in the Tax  Group Exit Agreement, the Sellers will have
no obligation to indemnify the  French Companies for losing their right to
carry forward tax losses as a result  of their exit from the French tax
group.

 

 

3.5 The  provisions of paragraph 3.1  shall  also operate to limit or
reduce the liability of the Sellers in respect of  claims under the Tax
Warranties and any other Warranty insofar as it relates  to  tax, save that
they shall not operate to limit or reduce the liability of the  Sellers in
respect of a claim under paragraph 17(a) of Part D of Schedule 3  to  the
extent that the liability would not have arisen but for any disposal (or 
deemed disposal for any tax purpose) after Closing of any asset other than 
trading stock by a French Company.

 

 

**4.** **Overprovisions**

 

 

4.1 The  relevant Seller may require the auditors for the time being of a
Target Company  to certify, at its request and expense, the existence and
amount of any  Overprovision in relation to that Target Company and the
Purchaser shall  provide, or procure that each Target Company provides, any
information or  assistance required for the purpose of production by the
auditors of a  certificate to that effect.

 

 

4.2 Subject  to paragraph 4.4  below:

 

 

       (a)   |  

any  Overprovision shall first be set against any payment then due from 
any  Seller under this Schedule or for breach of any Tax  Warranty;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

to  the extent that there is an excess, a payment shall promptly be made 
to  the relevant Seller equal to the aggregate of any payment or payments 
previously made by any Seller under this Schedule or for breach of  any Tax 
Warranty (and not previously refunded under this Schedule) up to  the 
amount of the excess; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

to  the extent that there is any remaining excess, it shall be carried 
forward  and set off against any future liability of any Seller under this 
Schedule  or for breach of any Tax Warranty (with the intent that, if there 
is no  such future liability, such excess shall be retained by the Target 
Companies and/or the Purchaser).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  102  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3 Either  the relevant Seller or the Purchaser may, at its own expense,
require any  certificate produced in accordance with paragraph 4.1  above
to  be reviewed by the auditors for the time being of the relevant Target
Company  in  the event that there are relevant circumstances or facts of
which it was not  aware, and which were not taken into account, at the time
when such certificate  was produced, and to certify whether the certificate
remains correct or whether  it should be amended.

 

 

4.4 If  the  certificate is amended following a request under paragraph
4.1,  the  revised amount of Overprovision shall be substituted for the
purposes of  paragraph 4.2,  and any  adjusting payment that is required
shall be made within 15 Business Days of  the  amendment of the certificate.

 

 

**5.** **Costs  and expenses**

 

 

The  covenants contained in paragraph 2  shall  extend to all reasonable
costs and expenses properly incurred by the Purchaser  in connection with a
successful claim made under that paragraph, or in  satisfying or settling any
tax liability in accordance with  paragraph 9  in  respect of which a
successful claim is made under paragraph 2.

 

 

**6.** **Double  recovery**

 

 

The  Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any amount pursuant to this
Schedule  in respect of any claim to the extent that the Purchaser or any
Target Company  has already recovered any amount in respect of such claim
under the Warranties  or under any other provision of this Agreement or
pursuant to any other  agreement with any Seller or any company connected
with any Seller, or to the  extent that recovery has already been made under
this Schedule in respect of  the  same subject matter.

 

 

**7.** **Tax  Refunds**

 

 

7.1 (i)  In  respect of Corporation Tax, upon receipt by the relevant Seller
of a statement  from a tax authority or the relevant Seller's tax advisers
(obtained at the  relevant Seller's expense) of any right to receive or
actual receipt of any  amount by way of repayment of tax or interest on
overpaid tax or repayment  supplement, and (ii) in respect of tax other than
Corporation Tax, upon the  Purchaser or any Target Company becoming aware
thereof, the Purchaser shall  promptly notify the relevant Seller of any
right to receive or actual receipt  of  such amount, in each of (i) and (ii)
being an amount to which a Target Company  (or as the case may be, the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser\'s Group,  on  behalf or in respect
of any of the French Companies) is or becomes entitled  or  receives in
respect of an event occurring or period (or part period) ending  on  or
prior to the Closing Date (including any repayment attributable to a 
Surrender in respect of a period or part period ending on or prior to the 
Closing Date whenever such Surrender is effected), where or to the extent
that  such amount was not included in the Accounts as an asset (save for an
amount  relating to the Short Bros Receivable), does not arise from the use
of a  Purchaser's relief and is not a payment or relief to which  paragraph
11  below  applies (a **_tax  refund_** ).

7.2 Any  tax  refund actually obtained after the Closing Date, whether by
repayment or set-off  (and less any reasonable costs of obtaining it and any
tax payable thereon)  and  provided that (in the case of a tax refund in
respect of Corporation Tax) the  relevant Seller receives a statement
referred to in paragraph 7.1  above,  shall be dealt with as follows:

 

 

       (a)   |  

the  amount of the tax refund shall be set against any payment then due 
under  this Schedule or for breach of any Tax Warranty from any  Seller;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

to  the extent that there is an excess, a payment shall promptly be made 
to  the relevant Seller equal to the aggregate of any payment or payments 
previously made by any Seller under this Schedule or for breach of  any Tax 
Warranty (and not previously refunded under this Schedule) up to  the 
amount of the excess; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

where  the tax refund relates to the Short Bros Receivable or the amount  of
the  tax refund is more than US$100,000, a payment shall promptly be made 
to  the relevant Seller equal to the amount of any excess remaining after 
the  application of sub-paragraph (b)  above; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

where  sub-paragraph (c)  above does not apply to the tax refund, any excess
remaining after  the  application of sub-paragraph (b)  above shall  be
carried forward and set off against any future liability of any  Seller 
under this Schedule of for the breach of any Tax Warranty (with the  intent 
that, if there is no such future liability, such excess shall be  retained 
by the Target Companies and/or the  Purchaser).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

7.3 Paragraph 11.4  shall  apply in respect of any sum payable to any Seller
under this  paragraph 7  which is  not paid by the later of the date
fifteen Business Days after the relevant  tax  refund is obtained by the
Target Company concerned and, in the case of a tax  refund in respect of
Corporation Tax, the date on which the relevant Seller  receives a statement
referred to in paragraph 7.1  above  (the ** _  due date_** )  as it 
applies to any sum not paid by the Purchaser on the due date of payment 
specified in paragraph 11.2.

 

 

**8.** **Secondary  Liabilities**

 

 

8.1 The  Purchaser severally covenants with each of the Sellers to pay to the
relevant  Seller (or, if there is no relevant Seller, to each of the Sellers
in the same  proportion as the price for its respective Set of Shares at the
relevant time,  as determined by clause 2.1, bears to the aggregate price for
all of the Sets  of  Shares at that time and as so determined) an amount
equivalent to any tax or  any  amount on account of tax which any member of
the Retained Group is required  to  pay as a result of a failure by any
Target Company, or any other member of  the  Purchaser's Group, to discharge
that tax.

 

 

8.2 Each  of  the relevant Sellers severally covenants with the Purchaser to
pay to the  Purchaser (or, if there is no relevant Seller, each of the
Sellers severally  covenants with the Purchaser to pay to the Purchaser, in
the same proportion  as  the price for its

respective  Set of Shares at the relevant time, as determined by clause 2.1,
bears to the  aggregate price for all of the Sets of Shares at that time and
as so determined)  an amount equivalent to any tax or any amount on account
of tax which any Target  Company, or any other member of the Purchaser's
Group, is required to pay as a  result of a failure by any member of the
Retained Group to discharge that  tax.

 

 

8.3 The  Dutch  Seller and the Purchaser (each of which is the **_relevant 
party_**   where it  is the covenantor) hereby covenant to each other to pay
to the other party,  to  the extent not already covered in this agreement
and by way of adjustment to  the  consideration for the sale of the relevant
Shares, an amount equivalent to  any  credit ( _verrekening_ )  by the 
Dutch tax authorities under article 24(2) of the Dutch Tax Collection Act
1990  in respect of any Dutch tax which, but for the application of the
aforementioned  article, would have been due and payable by the relevant
party (or any other  member of the Retained Group or the Purchaser's Group,
as the case may be) and  where the other party (or any other member of the
Purchaser's Group or the  Retained Group, as the case may be) loses an amount
that, but for this credit,  would have been available to it as a relief.

 

 

8.4 The  Purchaser covenants with the Dutch Seller to pay to the Dutch Seller
an amount  equivalent to any tax or any amount on account of tax in respect
of, by  reference to or in consequence of any income, profits or gains
earned, accrued  or received by a Dutch Company, as determined in accordance
with the rules  of  article 15ah of the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969, which
the Dutch Seller or  any  other member of the Retained Group is required to
pay or which results in a  loss  of an amount that, but for this tax, would
have been available to it as a  relief.

 

 

8.5 The  covenants contained in paragraphs 8.1  to 8.4  inclusive shall:

 

 

       (a)   |  

extend  to any reasonable costs incurred in connection with such tax or a 
claim  under any of those paragraphs;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

(in  the case of paragraphs 8.1  and 8.4  and the covenant by the Purchaser
under paragraph 8.3)  not apply to tax to the extent that the Purchaser could
claim payment  in  respect of it under paragraph 2  (or would have been
able to claim but for paragraph 3.1(f)  or  3.1(g)),  except to the extent
that a payment has been made pursuant to  paragraph 0  and the tax to which
it relates was not paid by the Target Company  concerned; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

not  apply to tax to the extent it has been recovered under any relevant 
statutory provision (and the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case  may be, 
shall procure that no such recovery is sought to the extent that  payment 
is made hereunder).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

8.6 Paragraphs 9.1, 9.3  and 10  (conduct  of disputes and due date for
payment) shall apply to the covenants contained  in  paragraphs 8.1 
to 8.4  inclusive as they apply to the covenants contained in  paragraph
2,  replacing references to the Sellers by the Purchaser (and vice versa)
where  appropriate and making any other necessary modifications.

**9.** **Notification  of claims and conduct of disputes**

 

 

9.1 If  the  Purchaser or any Target Company, or any other member of the
Purchaser\'s Group,  becomes aware of any tax claim, the Purchaser shall give
notice to the relevant  Seller of that tax claim (including any details
reasonably available at the  time  of such tax claim, the due date for any
payment and the time limits for any  appeal or any other relevant response,
and so far as practicable the amount  of  the claim under this Schedule or
under the Tax Warranties in respect thereof)  as  soon as reasonably
practicable (and, if there is a time limit of 30 days or  less  in which an
appeal or other action must be taken in respect of the tax claim,  in  any
event not more than ten Business Days after the Purchaser or the Target 
Company or other member of the Purchaser\'s Group concerned becomes aware of 
such  claim). Subject to the relevant Seller having indemnified the Purchaser
and  the  relevant Target Company to the Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction
against any  reasonable costs and expenses that they may thereby properly
incur, the  Purchaser shall take (or procure that the Target Company
concerned shall take)  such action as the relevant Seller may reasonably
request to avoid, dispute,  resist, appeal, compromise or defend any tax
claim (whether notified by the  Purchaser, or being a tax claim of which the
relevant Seller was already aware)  and any adjudication in respect thereof.
The relevant Seller shall have the  right (if it wishes) to control any
proceedings taken in connection with such  action, and shall in any event be
kept fully informed of any actual or proposed  developments (including any
meetings) and shall be provided with copies of  all  correspondence and
documentation relating to such tax claim or action, and  such  other
information, assistance and access to records and personnel as it  reasonably
requires.

 

 

9.2 Subject  to paragraph 9.3,  the  Purchaser shall procure that no tax
claim, action or issue in respect of which  any Seller could be required to
make a payment under this Schedule or for breach  of any Tax Warranty is
settled or otherwise compromised without that Seller's  prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,  and the
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that each Target Company, any other 
member of the Purchaser\'s Group and any of their respective advisers shall, 
not  submit any correspondence or return or send any other document to any
tax  authority where the Purchaser or any such person is aware or could
reasonably  be  expected to be aware that the effect of submitting such
correspondence or return  or sending such document would or could be to put
such tax authority on notice  of any matter which could give rise to, or
could increase, a claim under this  Schedule or for breach of any Tax
Warranty, without first affording the relevant  Seller a reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon and without taking account  of  such comments
so far as it is reasonable to do so.

 

 

9.3 If  the  relevant Seller does not request the Purchaser to take any
appropriate action  within 30 days of notice to the relevant Seller, the
Purchaser shall be free  to  satisfy or settle the relevant tax liability on
such terms as it may reasonably  think fit.

 

 

9.4 If  the  relevant Seller takes up its right under paragraph 9.1  to 
control the conduct of a tax claim, the Purchaser shall promptly be kept
fully  informed of all material matters pertaining to the tax claim and shall
be  entitled to see copies of all relevant correspondence relating thereto.
If  the  relevant Seller takes up its rights under paragraph

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  106  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.1  as  aforesaid, the relevant Seller shall not (and shall procure that
its agents  shall not) compromise, settle, admit or otherwise deal with any
such proceedings  (or any matter in issue therein) without the consent of the
Purchaser (not  to be  unreasonably withheld or delayed), PROVIDED THAT it
is hereby agreed that the  Purchaser will be deemed automatically to have
consented where the compromise,  settlement, admission or dealing is
consistent with the practice of the Target  Companies for periods ending on
or prior to Closing (save to the extent required  by law, any applicable
regulation or generally applicable accounting  principles). The Purchaser and
the relevant Seller agree that, if the Purchaser  refuses (or unreasonably
withholds or delays giving) its consent to any  compromise, settlement,
admission or dealing, the provisions of clause 31  (Settlement of Disputes)
shall apply to the matter in dispute.

 

 

**10.** **Due  date of payment and interest**

 

 

10.1 Subject  to paragraph 10.2,  each  Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
any amount payable by it under this Schedule  on or before the date which is
the later of the date ten Business Days after  demand is made therefor by the
Purchaser and two Business Days before the first  date on which the tax in
question becomes due and payable to the tax authority  demanding the same.
Provided that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

if  the date on which the tax becomes due and payable is deferred following 
application to the relevant tax authority, the date for payment by  each 
Seller shall be two Business Days before such later date when the  amount 
of tax is finally and conclusively determined (and for this purpose,  an 
amount of tax shall be deemed to be finally determined when, in respect  of 
such amount, an agreement under section 54 of the United Kingdom  Taxes
Management Act 1970 or any legislative provision corresponding  to  that
section is made, or a decision of a court or tribunal is given  or any 
binding agreement or determination or an enforceable decision of  a tax 
authority imposing a payment of tax is made, from which either no  appeal 
lies or in respect of which no appeal is made within the prescribed  time 
limit, ignoring the power of any person to allow appeals out of time);  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

if  a payment or payments to the relevant tax authority prior to the  date 
otherwise specified by this paragraph would avoid or minimise interest  or 
penalties, each Seller may at its option pay the whole or part of  the 
amount due to the Purchaser on an earlier date or dates, and the  Purchaser 
shall procure that the tax in question (or the appropriate part of  it) is 
promptly paid to the relevant tax  authority.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

A  Seller  may make a direct payment in respect of the tax liability in
question to the  relevant tax authority (including through use of
certificates of tax deposit  or  the equivalent), and that Seller's
liability to the Purchaser shall be treated  as reduced or eliminated
accordingly.

 

 

10.2 Where  a  claim under this Schedule relates to the use or set-off of a
Purchaser's relief,  the relevant Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the
amount due from it under  this  Schedule in respect thereof on the later of
the date which is two Business  Days  before the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  107  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  date on which tax which would not have been payable but for such use
or set-off  becomes due and payable to the tax authority demanding the same,
and ten  Business Days after demand is made therefor by the Purchaser, such
demand to  be  accompanied by reasonably sufficient evidence provided by the
Purchaser or  its  tax advisers (obtained or procured to be obtained by and
at the expense of  the  Purchaser) of such use or set-off and as the
relevant Seller requires to  ascertain that it has a liability of a stated
amount in respect of such claim  and that tax has, or will on a specified
date, become due and payable as  aforesaid.

 

 

10.3 Where  a  claim under this Schedule relates to the loss, reduction,
cancellation or  clawback of any such relief as is referred to in sub-
paragraph (c) of the  definition of tax liability, the relevant Seller shall
pay to the Purchaser  the  amount due from it under this Schedule in respect
thereof on the later of the  date which is 5 Business Days after the date on
which such relief is lost,  reduced, cancelled or clawed back or, if later,
the date which is ten Business  Days after the date on which demand is made
therefor by the Purchaser, such  demand to be accompanied by reasonably
sufficient evidence provided by the  Purchaser or its tax advisers (obtained
or procured to be obtained by and at  the  expense of the Purchaser) of such
loss, reduction, cancellation or clawback  and  as the relevant Seller
requires to ascertain that it has a liability of a stated  amount in respect
of such claim.

 

 

10.4 Any  sum  not paid by a Seller on the due date for payment specified
in  paragraph 10.1  or 10.2  shall  bear Default Interest (which shall
accrue from day to day after as well as  before any judgment for the same)
from the due date to and including the day  of  actual payment of such sum,
compounded six monthly, provided that Default  Interest shall not accrue to
the extent that the Seller's liability under  paragraph 2  or  paragraph
5  extends  to interest or penalties arising after the due date. Any
interest due under  this  paragraph shall be paid on the demand of the
Purchaser on or following the  date  of payment of such sum.

 

 

**11.** **Recovery  from third parties/tax savings**

 

 

11.1 If  any  payment is made by a Seller under this Schedule or for breach
of any Tax  Warranty in respect of a tax liability or other matter and the
Purchaser or  any  Target Company (or any person connected with or related
to any of them,  including any member of the Purchaser\'s Group) either
receives, or is entitled  or may be entitled either immediately or at some
future date to recover or  obtain, from any person (other than the Purchaser
or any Target Company or  any  such connected person) a payment or relief
which would not have arisen but  for  the tax liability or other matter in
question or the circumstances giving rise  thereto (including without
limitation in circumstances where a tax liability  arises because a deduction
or other relief assumed to be available in preparing  the Accounts is in fact
available only in a subsequent period or periods),  then:

 

 

       (a)   |  

the  Purchaser shall notify that Seller of that fact as soon as reasonably 
possible after the Purchaser or any Target Company becomes aware  of the 
same and, if so required by the Seller and subject to the Seller  having 
first indemnified the Purchaser and the relevant Target Company against  any
reasonable costs and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  108  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         |  

expenses  that they may thereby properly incur, shall take (or shall
procure  that  the Target Company or other person concerned shall take) such
action  as  the Seller may reasonably request to enforce such recovery or
to  obtain  such payment or relief (keeping the Seller fully informed of
the  progress  of any action taken and providing it with copies of all
relevant  correspondence and documentation);  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (b)   |  

if  the Purchaser or the Target Company or other person (including any 
member  of the Purchaser\'s Group) concerned receives or obtains such a
payment  or  relief, the Purchaser shall pay to that Seller the amount
received  or the  amount that the Purchaser or the Target Company or other
person concerned  (including any member of the Purchaser\'s Group) will save
by virtue  of the  payment or the relief (less any reasonable costs of
recovering or  obtaining such payment or relief and any tax actually suffered
thereon)  (the **_Benefit_** )  to the extent that the amount of the Benefit
does not exceed the  aggregate  payments previously made by any Seller under
this Schedule and for  breach  of any Tax Warranty, and except where any
amount so saved would otherwise  have given rise to a claim under this
Schedule or for breach of any  Tax  Warranty (in which event no such claim
shall be made). Any amount  of the  Benefit not so paid to the Seller shall
be carried forward and set  off  against any future claims against any
Seller under this Schedule  or for  breach of any Tax Warranty.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

11.2 Any  payment required to be made by the Purchaser pursuant to 
paragraph 11.1  shall be  made:

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  a case where the Purchaser or the Target Company or other person 
concerned  (including any member of the Purchaser\'s Group) receives a
payment,  within  ten Business Days of the receipt thereof;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  a case where the Purchaser or the Target Company or other person 
concerned  (including any member of the Purchaser\'s Group) obtains a
relief,  on or  before the date on which tax would have become recoverable
by the  appropriate tax authority but for the use of such  relief.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

11.3 The  Purchaser shall procure that any such relief as is referred to in 
paragraph 11.2(b)  is used  in priority to any other relief. The Seller
referred to in paragraph 11.1  shall be  entitled, at its own cost, to
require that the auditors of the relevant Target  Company and/or other person
(including any member of the Purchaser\'s Group)  shall certify the amount
and date of use of such relief for the purposes of  this  paragraph 11.

 

 

11.4 Any  sum  not paid by the Purchaser on the due date of payment
specified in  paragraph 11.2  shall  bear Default Interest (which shall
accrue from day to day after, as well as  before, any judgment for the same)
from the due date to and including the day  of  actual payment of such sum,
compounded six monthly. Such interest shall be  paid  on the demand of the
Seller referred to in paragraph 11.1.

**Rights  and Obligations of the Sellers**

 

 

12.2 Subject  to and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the
relevant Seller  or its duly authorised agents shall, in respect of all
accounting periods ending  on or before Closing, in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the  Target Companies in relation to the relevant
matters (save to the extent  required by law, any applicable regulation or
generally applicable accounting  principles) and at the relevant Seller's own
cost:

 

 

       (a)   |  

prepare  the tax returns of each of the Target Companies for the purposes 
of  Corporation Tax;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

(subject  to paragraph 14)  prepare on behalf of the Target Companies all
claims, elections,  surrenders, disclaimers, notices and consents for the
purposes of  Corporation Tax; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

(subject  to paragraph 9)  deal with all matters relating to Corporation Tax
which concern or  affect  any of the Target Companies, including the conduct
of all negotiations  and  correspondence and the reaching of all agreements
relating thereto  or to  any tax documents, but excluding payment of  tax.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

12.3 The  relevant Seller or its duly authorised agents shall deliver all tax
documents  which are required to be signed by or on behalf of any Target
Company to the  Purchaser for authorisation, signing and submission to the
relevant tax  authority, provided that the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  110  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser  shall not be obliged to sign or authorise any tax document which
it does not  consider (acting reasonably) is complete or accurate in all
material respects.  If a time limit applies in relation to any tax document,
the relevant Seller  shall ensure that the Purchaser receives the tax
document no later than ten  Business Days (or, in the case of a tax return,
thirty Business Days) before  the  expiry of the time limit.

 

 

12.4 The  relevant Seller shall procure that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

the  Purchaser receives copies of all written correspondence with any  tax 
authority insofar as it is relevant to the pre-Closing tax  affairs;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

the  Purchaser is afforded the opportunity to comment within a reasonable 
period of time on any tax document or other non-routine correspondence  prior
to its submission to the relevant tax authority, and the relevant  Seller
shall take into account any such comments made by the Purchaser  as  the
relevant Seller (acting reasonably) considers to be reasonable,  and  the
parties hereby agree that, if the relevant Seller refuses to  take into 
account any comment made by the Purchaser in relation to any return  and 
the Purchaser (acting reasonably) disagrees with such matter, the 
disagreement shall be a dispute for the purpose of clause 31 (Settlement  of
Disputes) and the provisions of that clause shall apply thereto; 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

no  tax document is submitted to any tax authority which is misleading  or,
so  far as the relevant Seller is aware, not true and accurate in all 
material  respects; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

it  does not agree any material matter relating to its tax affairs with 
any  tax authority (in a way which is not consistent with its past
practice,  save to the extent required by law, any applicable regulation or 
generally  applicable accounting principles) without the consent of the
Purchaser  (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Purchaser
refuses  (or  unreasonably withholds or delays giving) its consent under
this paragraph  (d),  the matter shall be considered a dispute for the
purposes of clause  31  (Settlement of Disputes) and the provisions of that
clause shall  apply  accordingly.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**Obligations  of the Purchaser**

 

 

12.5 The  Purchaser shall procure that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

the  relevant Seller and its duly authorised agents are afforded such 
access  (including the taking of copies) to the books, accounts and records 
of the  Target Companies and such other assistance as it or they reasonably 
require to enable the relevant Seller to discharge its obligations  under 
this Schedule and to enable the relevant Seller and any member of  the 
Retained Group to comply with its own tax obligations or facilitate  the 
management or settlement of its own tax  affairs;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

the  Target Companies and any other members of the Purchaser's Group shall 
properly retain and maintain the books, accounts and records of the  Target

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  111  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         |  

Companies  and any other members of the Purchaser's Group shall properly
retain and  maintain the books, accounts and records of the Target
Companies  until the  applicable statutory limitation period expires (giving
effect to  any  extension thereof) and shall abide by all record retention
agreements  entered into with any tax authority and shall give the
respective  Seller  reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying, or  discarding  any such books, accounts and records and, if
that Seller so requests,  shall allow that Seller to take possession of such
books, accounts  and  records;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (c)   |  

the  relevant Seller is promptly sent a copy of any communication from  any
tax  authority insofar as it relates to the pre-Closing tax  affairs;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

unless  at the direction of the relevant Seller or its duly authorised
agents  pursuant to paragraph 12.2  or  any other provision of this
Schedule, no voluntary action is taken  by any  Target Company or any other
member of the Purchaser's Group after Closing  (whether by disclaiming any
relief, withdrawing or revoking any claim,  disclaimer or consent or
otherwise) which would or is likely either  to  prejudice or reduce the
availability of any relief surrendered or  to be  surrendered between any
Target Company and any member of the Retained  Group, or otherwise adversely
to affect the tax position of any member  of  the Retained Group;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (e)   |  

there  is given to such person or persons as may for the time being be
nominated  by the relevant Seller authority to conduct pre-Closing tax
affairs,  and  that such authority is confirmed to any relevant tax 
authority.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

12.6 The  Purchaser shall (subject to paragraph 12.3  above or  paragraph
12.9 below) be obliged to procure that the Target Companies shall  cause any
tax document delivered to it under paragraph 12.3  to be  authorised and
signed without delay and without amendment, and submitted to  the 
appropriate tax authority without delay (and in any event within any
relevant  time limit).

 

 

12.7 The  Purchaser shall not voluntarily communicate with the Dutch tax
authorities  in  connection with the possible application of the 16th 
Standard  Condition or article 15ai of the Netherlands Corporate Income Tax
Act 1969  and,  in the event that the Dutch tax authorities raise questions
in connection  therewith, the Purchaser shall not send any communication to
the Dutch tax  authorities in relation thereto without the consent of the
Dutch Seller (such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
Purchaser agrees that  it will submit all of its tax returns on the basis
that article 15ai of the  Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 and the
16th Standard Condition do  not  apply to the Dutch fiscal unity which
existed between the Dutch Seller and  a  Dutch Company prior to Closing,
unless the Purchaser has no reasonable position  to do so.

 

 

12.8 If  the  Dutch tax authorities determine that, other than as a result
of a breach of  the  Purchaser's obligations under paragraph 12.7, the
16th  Standard  Condition or article 15ai of the Netherlands Corporate
Income Tax Act 1969  applies as a result of Closing to the Dutch fiscal unity
which existed between  the Dutch Seller and a Dutch Company prior to Closing,
then the Purchaser  covenants to pay to the Dutch Seller, by way of an

adjustment  to the consideration for the sale of the relevant Shares and on
or before the  date ten Business Days after demand is made therefor by the
Dutch Seller, an  amount equal to the Dutch Tax Benefit, if and when actually
realised. For the  purposes of this paragraph 12.8, the " **Dutch  Tax
Benefit** " is  the  amount of the actual decrease of corporate income tax
due which arises to a  Dutch Company (or, as the case may be, to the fiscal
unity which a Dutch Company  has joined or will join) as a consequence of the
application of the  16th  Standard  Condition or article 15ai of the
Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act 1969  giving rise to a greater
depreciation base in its assets.

 

 

**Rights  of the Purchaser**

 

 

12.9 The  Purchaser shall be under no obligation to procure the
authorisation, signing  or  submission to a tax authority of any tax
document delivered to it under  paragraph 12.3  which it  considers in its
reasonable opinion to be false or misleading in a material  respect, but for
the avoidance of doubt shall be under no obligation to make  any  enquiry as
to the completeness or accuracy thereof and shall be entitled to  rely 
entirely on the relevant Seller and its agents.

 

 

**13.** **Conduct  of other Tax Affairs**

 

 

13.1 Subject  to paragraph 9  and the  following sub-paragraphs, the
Purchaser or its duly authorised agents shall  have  sole conduct of all tax
affairs of the Target Companies which are not  pre-Closing tax affairs and
shall be entitled to deal with such tax affairs  in  any way in which it in
its absolute discretion considers fit, provided that  the  Purchaser shall
ensure that all such tax affairs relating to periods prior  to  Closing are
dealt with in an expeditious manner.

 

 

13.2 In  respect of any accounting period for Corporation Tax purposes
commencing prior  to Closing and ending after Closing (the **_Straddle 
Period_** )  and in  respect of any accounting period commencing prior to
Closing for the purposes  of  any other tax, the Purchaser shall procure
that the tax returns of each Target  Company shall be prepared on a basis
which is consistent with the manner in  which the tax returns of that Target
Company were prepared for all accounting  periods ending prior to Closing
(save to the extent required by law, any  applicable regulation or generally
applicable accounting  principles).

 

 

13.3 The  Purchaser shall procure that the Target Companies provide to the
relevant Seller  all tax returns for Corporation Tax purposes relating to the
Straddle Period  no  later than 30 Business Days before the date on which
such tax returns are  required to be filed with the appropriate tax authority
without incurring  interest or penalties. The Purchaser shall further procure
that, before the  tax  returns are submitted to the appropriate tax
authority, the Target Companies  shall take into account any such comments
made by the relevant Seller as the  Purchaser (acting reasonably) considers
to be reasonable, to the extent that  those comments do not relate solely to
matters occurring  after Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  113  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13.4   The  relevant Seller shall provide such assistance as the Purchaser
shall reasonably  request in preparing all tax returns of the Target
Companies relating to the  Straddle Period.

 

 

**14.** **Surrenders  between the Retained Group and the** **Target 
Companies**

 

 

14.1 Subject  to the following provisions of this paragraph 14,  and 
without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 12,  the  Purchaser shall
procure that the Target Companies shall, in respect of any  time  or period
falling on or prior to the Closing Date (which for the purposes of  this
paragraph 14  shall  include, for the avoidance of doubt, any overlapping
period pursuant to section  403A of the Taxes Act), make, give or enter into
such claims, elections,  surrenders, notices or consents (whether
unconditional or conditional, whether  or not forming part of any other
return or tax document, whether provisional  or  final, and including
amendments to or withdrawals of earlier claims, elections,  surrenders,
notices or consents, whether or not made before or after Closing)  as  the
relevant Seller shall direct in connection with  any  Surrender by or to any
member of the Retained Group to or by (as the case may  be) any of the Target
Companies. No payment shall be made after the date of  this  agreement in
respect of any such Surrender by or to any member of the Retained  Group to
or by any of the Target Companies except to the extent set out in  the 
following provisions of this paragraph 14.

 

 

14.2 If  and to  the extent that:

 

 

       (a)   |  

any  Target Company has paid Corporation Tax (otherwise than in
circumstances  where a claim has been or could be made under paragraph 2 
in  respect thereof), and a Surrender effected pursuant to  paragraph 14.1 
or  any Surrender effected prior to Closing has the effect of causing  a 
repayment after Closing of some or all of that tax (with or without  any 
repayment supplement within the meaning of section 825 of the Taxes  Act or
interest under section 826 of that Act);  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

but  for a Surrender effected pursuant to paragraph 14.1  or  prior to
Closing (and ignoring the effect of any Purchaser's relief, to  the extent
allowed by law), any Target Company would have had a liability  to
Corporation Tax in respect of which the Purchaser would not have  been  able
to make a claim under paragraph 2;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

provision  for Corporation Tax is made in the Accounts, and a Surrender has 
the  effect of discharging all or part of the liability represented by 
that  provision (save to the extent that payment has been made in respect 
of  such Surrender, including without limitation by way of book entry,  on
or  before Closing);  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

provision  for payment in respect of a Surrender is made in the Accounts
(save  to the  extent that such payment has been made, including without
limitation  by  way of book entry,  on  or before Closing),

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  114  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Purchaser shall procure that, in respect of any such Surrender to which
a member  of the Retained Group is a party, a payment for group relief
(within the meaning  of section 402(6) of the Taxes Act) shall be made to the
relevant member of  the  Retained Group by the Target Company concerned.

 

 

14.3 The  amount of any such payment as is referred to in paragraph 14.2 
shall be  equal to:

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(a)  applies, the amount of Corporation Tax
so repaid (together with any  repayment supplement or interest), less any
amount of such repayment  (or  repayment supplement or interest) the right
to which was included  as an  asset in the Accounts, and less Corporation
Tax suffered on such  interest;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(b)  applies, the amount of Corporation Tax
which would have been required  to  be paid but for the Surrender (ignoring
the effect of any Purchaser's  relief, to the extent allowed by law);  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(c)  applies, the amount of Corporation Tax
saved as a result of the relevant  Surrender, up to a maximum of the amount
in respect of which provision  is  made in the Accounts;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(d)  applies, the amount in respect of which
provision is made in the  Accounts.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

14.4 Any  payment under paragraph 14.3  shall be  made:

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(a)  applies, on the date two Business Days
after the date on which such  repayment is received, or would be received but
for some event or  action  within paragraph 14.5  or  but for being offset
by some other tax liability;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.2(b),  14.2(c)  or  14.2(d)  applies, on
the later of the date on which such tax would have become  due  and payable
(or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next following  Business Day)
and ten Business Days after the date on which notice  is  given by the
relevant Seller to the Purchaser of such  Surrender,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

and  interest shall be charged on any amount not paid on the due date as
provided  in  paragraph 11.4.

 

 

14.5 In  ascertaining the amount of any payment under paragraph 14.3,  and
the  time of such payment, no account shall be taken of any event or action
occurring  after Closing (including any loss arising in a period ending after
Closing)  which has or could have the effect:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  115  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.3(a)  applies, of deferring, reducing or
eliminating any repayment to any  Target  Company (or the receipt of any
repayment supplement or  interest);

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.3(b),  14.3(c)  or  14.3(d)  applies, of
deferring, reducing or eliminating tax which would otherwise  have become
payable,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

and  in  such a case paragraph 14.2  shall  apply as if such event or
action had not occurred.

 

 

14.6 Where,  in  respect of a relevant accounting period (within the meaning
of section 102  of  the United Kingdom Finance Act 1989) ended on or before
the Closing Date,  section 102(4) applies in relation to:

 

 

       (a)   |  

a  surrendering company in the Retained Group and a recipient company 
which  is any Target Company, then to the extent  that:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

an  amount corresponding to tax which the recipient company is deemed  to
have  paid by virtue of section 102(4)(a) has been provided for in the 
Accounts  or has previously been paid by the recipient company (otherwise
than  in  circumstances where a claim has been or could be made under 
paragraph 0  of  this Schedule in respect thereof) (in each case the
**_amount  saved_** );  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |  

provision  is made in the Accounts for payment in respect of the surrender
(save  to  the extent that such payment has been made in respect of such
surrender,  including without limitation by way of book entry, on or before 
Closing),

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

the  Purchaser shall procure that a payment for a transferred tax refund
(within  the  meaning of section 102(7)) shall be made to the relevant
member of the Retained  Group of an amount equal to the amount saved or the
amount provided (as the  case  may be);  or

 

 

       (b)   |  

a  surrendering company which is any Target Company and a recipient 
company  in the Retained Group, then to the extent that the right to the
relevant  tax refund has been included as an asset in the Accounts (the
__**_refund  amount_** ),  the relevant Seller shall procure that a payment
for a transferred  tax  refund (within the meaning of section 102(7)) shall
be made to the  relevant Target Company equal to the refund  amount.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

14.7 Any  payment for a transferred tax refund pursuant to paragraph 14.6 
above  shall be made:

 

 

       (a)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.6(a)  applies, on the later of the date on
which the tax provided for in  the  Accounts, or saved by the surrender,
would have become due and payable  but  for the application of section 102
or, if the tax has been paid,  the

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  116  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         |  

day  following the day on which the amount saved is repaid by the relevant 
tax  authority (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next following 
Business Day) and ten Business Days after demand is made therefor  by the 
relevant member of the Retained Group;  or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  a case where paragraph 14.6(b)  applies, on the date on which the tax
refund in question would have  been  received by the Target Company
concerned but for the application  of  section 102,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

and  interest shall be charged on any amount not paid on the due date as
provided  in  paragraph 11.4  (where  paragraph 14.6(a)  applies)  or
paragraph 10.4  (where  paragraph 14.6(b)  applies).

 

 

14.8 If  a  payment is made under paragraph 14.2  or 14.6  and the 
Surrender or transfer of tax refund to which it relates is subsequently 
determined to have been invalid or ineffective to any extent or excessive, 
then  the payment so made (or so much of it as relates to such part of the
Surrender  or transfer found to be invalid or ineffective or excessive) shall
be refunded  as soon as practicable thereafter, together with interest at
LIBOR from the  date  of payment until the date of the refund.

 

 

14.9 The  parties shall procure that, except as provided in the foregoing
provisions  of  this paragraph 14,  no  payment in respect of any
Surrender or any transfer of tax refund shall be  made  or repaid by or to a
member of the Retained Group to or by any Target Company  after Closing,
except as may be required by law or (in the case of a repayment)  to the
extent required (as specified by the relevant Seller, acting reasonably)  to
ensure that a payment previously made is not taxable. In the event that 
any  payment or repayment is in fact made by or to a member of the Retained
Group  to  or by any Target Company after Closing, otherwise than as
provided in paragraphs  14.2  to 14.8  above  (save  where a repayment
made pursuant to paragraph 14.8  arises  as a result of an insufficiency of
profits in the relevant company),  then:

 

 

        

(a)

    |  

if  such amount is received by a Target Company, the Purchaser will
promptly  pay an equivalent amount to the relevant Seller;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

(b)

    |  

if  such amount is received by a member of the Retained Group, the relevant 
Seller will promptly pay an equivalent amount to the  Purchaser,

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

in  each  case by way of adjustment to the consideration for the appropriate
Set of  Shares.

 

 

14.10 Paragraph 7  (tax  refunds) shall not apply to any tax refund to the
extent that a payment is  made  under this paragraph 14  to any  member of
the Retained Group which is attributable to that tax  refund.

 

 

14.11 Paragraph 2  shall  not apply to any tax liability to the extent that
a payment is made under this  paragraph 14  by any  member of the Retained
Group in respect of that tax liability.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  117  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14.12 In  the  event that provision for payment in respect of a Surrender is
made in the  Accounts, or a provision is made which may be either in respect
of payment  for a  Surrender or for Corporation Tax then, to the extent the
Surrender is not  validly made or is ineffective, that provision shall (to
that extent) be  treated, for the purposes of paragraphs 3.1(a)  and 4, 
as a  provision in respect of the tax liability which would otherwise have
been  eliminated by the Surrender.

 

 

14.13 For  the  avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph 14
shall not apply to  any Target Companies other than Fourninezero Limited and
Short Bros (Plant)  Limited.

 

 

**15.** **Instalment  Payments in France**

 

 

The  Purchaser shall procure that the French Companies which are, as at the
last  day  of the tax period preceding that in which Closing occurs, members
of the French  Seller's French tax group ( _int egration  fiscale_) 
pursuant to section 223 A _et  seq._ of  the  French general tax code (
_code  g eneral des impots_)  shall  comply with their obligations
resulting from the Tax Group Exit Agreement  ( _convention  de sortie d
'integration fiscale_)  with  respect to down-payments of taxes covered by
the French tax  consolidation.

 

 

**16.** **United  States Tax Considerations**

 

 

16.1 _Tax  Indemnification_.

 

 

Subject  to the exclusions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3, the USA Sellers jointly
and  severally covenant to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any
payment of  Taxes, and any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the
Purchaser attributable  to:

 



 

       (a)   |  

all  Taxes imposed on the USA Companies for any taxable period ending  on
or  prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Period"), and, with respect 
to  any period that begins on or before and that ends after the Closing 
Date  (in each case, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Straddle 
Period  deemed to end on and include the Closing Date (in the manner
determined  pursuant to paragraph 16.3);

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

all  Taxes imposed on the USA Companies under United States Treasury 
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (and all corresponding provisions of  state, 
local or foreign law) as a result of being a member of any federal,  state, 
local or foreign consolidated, combined, unitary, or similar group  of 
which the USA Seller is the common parent;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

all  Taxes of any person (other than another USA Company) imposed on the 
USA  Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to 
any  law, rule or regulation which Taxes relate to an event or transaction 
occurring before Closing.

16.2 Tax  Returns.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  118  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

The  USA Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause preparation and 
filing  of) with the appropriate tax authority all Tax Returns for the USA 
Companies (including any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns  for 
groups in which a USA Company is a member, but excluding any  Non-Corporation
Tax Returns) for Pre-Closing Periods, and shall pay  all  Taxes shown to be
due thereon.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

The  Purchaser shall timely prepare and file (or cause preparation and 
filing  of) with the appropriate tax authority all Tax Returns for the USA 
Companies for all Straddle Periods, and shall pay all Taxes shown  to be 
due thereon. All Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and  filed 
in a manner consistent with past practice, and no position shall  be taken, 
election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions  taken, 
elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax  Returns 
for prior periods, except as required by law. The Purchaser shall  deliver 
to the USA Seller all Straddle Period Tax Returns (with copies of  any 
relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)  for
the USA Seller\'s review and approval not less than thirty (30)  days  prior
to the due date thereof (including extensions),  and shall make such
revisions as are reasonably requested by the  USA  Seller. If  the USA
Seller agrees with the Straddle Period Tax Return as revised,  the  USA
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the Taxes  shown  on
such Straddle Period Tax Return to be attributed to the pre-closing  portion
of such Straddle Period under paragraph 16.3,  except for those Taxes
excluded under paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3. Such  payment  shall occur not later
than two (2) business days before the due date  for  the payment of Taxes
with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return.  Any  disputes regarding
the preparation of, or payment with respect to,  any  Straddle Period Tax
Return shall be resolved in the manner set forth  in  paragraph 16.10.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

The  Purchaser shall timely prepare and file (or cause preparation and 
filing  of) with the appropriate tax authority all Tax Returns due after 
the  Closing Date with respect to Taxes for all Pre-Closing Periods and 
Straddle Periods, other than Corporation Taxes of the USA Companies  ("Non-
Corporation Tax Returns"), and shall pay all Taxes shown to  be due 
thereon. All Non-Corporation Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed  in a 
manner consistent with past practice, and no position shall be taken, 
election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions  taken, 
elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax  Returns 
for prior periods, except as required by law. The Purchaser shall  deliver 
to the USA Seller all Non-Corporation Tax Returns (with copies of  any 
relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)  for
the USA Seller\'s review and approval not less than thirty (30)  days  prior
to the due date thereof (including extensions),  and shall make such
revisions as are reasonably requested by the  USA  Seller. If  the USA
Seller agrees with the Non-Corporation Tax Return as revised,  the  USA
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the Taxes  shown  on
such Non-Corporation Tax Return (or, in the case of a Non-Corporation  Tax
Return which is also a Straddle Period Tax Return, an amount  equal to  the
Taxes shown on such Tax Return attributed to  the

           |  

pre-closing  portion of such Straddle Period under paragraph 16.3),  except
for those Taxes excluded under paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3. Such  payment  shall
occur not later than two (2) Business Days before the due  date for  the
payment of Taxes with respect to such Non-Corporation Tax Return.  Any 
disputes regarding the preparation of, or payment with respect  to, any 
Non-Corporation Tax Return shall be resolved in the manner set  forth in 
paragraph 16.10.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

16.3 _Straddle  Period._

 

 

For  purposes of this paragraph 16, in order to apportion appropriately any
Taxes  relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent
permitted  or required under applicable law, treat the Closing Date as the
last day of  the  taxable year or period of the USA Companies for all Tax
purposes. In any case  where applicable law does not permit the USA Companies
to treat the Closing  Date  as the last day of the taxable year or period,
the portion of any Taxes that  are  allocable to a pre-closing portion of
any Straddle Period shall be: 

 



 

       (a)   |  

in  the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the 
business  or assets of the USA Companies the amount of such Taxes for the
entire  Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which  is
the  number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending 
on  and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the 
number  of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period;  and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

in  the case of Taxes not described in clause (i) (such as Taxes that  are 
either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed  in 
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property), 
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year  or 
period ended on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  any Taxes 
relating to any transactions not in the ordinary course of business  that 
occur after the Closing on the Closing Date shall be treated as occurring  on
the day after the Closing Date to the extent permitted by United  States 
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any comparable 
provision of state, local or foreign  law).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

16.4 _Tax  Cooperation and Assistance._

 

 

The  USA  Seller and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their  respective affiliates (including, in the case of the Purchaser
after the Closing  Date, the USA Companies), officers, employees, agents,
auditors and  representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax  Returns, including maintaining and making available to each
other all records  necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all
disputes and audits  with  respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.
At the request of the USA  Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, the
other party will furnish all  Tax information relating to the USA Companies
within ninety (90) days prior  to  the due date (including extensions) for
any Tax Returns required to be filed  by  such party pursuant to paragraph
16.2.  The USA  Seller, the Purchaser and their affiliates will need access,
from

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page  120  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  to  time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
records and  information relating to the USA Companies; therefore, each party
shall (and  shall cause their affiliates to) (i) properly retain and maintain
such records  until the applicable statute of limitations expires (giving
effect to any  extension thereof) and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered  into  with any tax authority, (ii) give each other party
reasonable written notice  prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding
any such books and records  and,  if a party so requests, shall allow that
party to take possession of such books  and records, and (iii) allow each
other party and its agents and representatives  (and agents and
representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and dates  mutually
acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such 
records it may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities  to be conducted during normal business hours and at the expense

16.5 _Refunds  and Credits_

 

 

Any  refund or credit of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Period or
any  pre-closing portion of a Straddle Period shall be dealt with in the
manner  set  forth in paragraphs 7.2(a) to (d) inclusive. Any refund or
credit of Taxes  of  the USA Companies for any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date shall  belong to and vest in the Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall, if the USA Seller  so  requests and at the USA Seller\'s
expense, cause the USA Companies to file for  and obtain any refunds or
credits to which the USA Seller is entitled under  this  paragraph 16.5. The
Purchaser and the USA Companies shall permit the USA Seller  to control the
prosecution of any such refund claim and, where deemed  appropriate by the
USA Seller, shall authorize by appropriate powers of attorney  such persons
as the USA Seller shall designate to represent the USA Companies  with
respect to such refund claim. Each party shall, or shall cause its 
affiliates to, forward to any other party entitled under this paragraph 16.5 
to  any refund or credit of Taxes any such refund within ten (10) days after
such  refund is received or reimburse such other party for any such credit
within  ten  (10) days after the credit is allowed or applied against other
Tax liability.  The parties shall treat any payments under the preceding
sentence as an  adjustment to the purchase price, unless a determination with
respect to the  Purchaser or any of its affiliates causes any such payment
not to be treated  as  an adjustment to the purchase price for United States
federal income Tax  purposes.

 



 

16.6 _Tax  Contests_

 

 

In  the  event any tax authority informs any party of any proposed or actual
audit,  examination, adjustment, claim, assessment, or demand (a "Tax Audit")
concerning  the amount of Taxes of the USA Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period  or Straddle Period, the party so informed shall notify each
other party of  such  matter within ten (10) Business Days after receiving
such notice. No failure  or  delay in informing the other party shall reduce
or otherwise affect the  obligations or liabilities of any party hereto,
except to the extent such  failure or delay shall have adversely affected the
recipient party\'s ability  to  defend against any liability or claim with
respect to such Taxes. Any notice  shall be accompanied by a copy of any
written notice or other document

received  from the applicable tax authority with respect to such matter. The
USA Seller  shall have the sole right to control, at its expense, the contest
of the  portions of any audits, disputes, administrative, judicial or other
proceedings  relating to Taxes of the USA Companies for any Pre-Closing
Period; provided,  however, that if the USA Seller elects to control the
contest, the USA Companies  and the Purchaser shall have the right, at their
expense, to participate in  such  contest. For avoidance of doubt, the
Purchaser and the USA Companies (and not  the USA Seller) shall have the sole
right to control the contest of the portion  of any audits, disputes,
administrative, judicial or other proceedings relating  to the taxes of the
USA Companies for all Straddle Periods; provided, however,  that the USA
Seller, at its expense, shall have the right to participate in  such 
contest as it may pertain to the pre-closing portion of such Straddle
Period.  No  party hereto shall agree, settle or compromise any issue
related to Taxes of  the  USA Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period or any Straddle Period,  which settlement or compromise would have any
adverse impact on the liability  for Taxes hereunder of the other party,
without consulting in good faith with  such other party, provided, however,
that any dispute with respect to a decision  to agree, settle or compromise
any issue related to Taxes of a consolidated,  combined or unitary group
whose members include a company which is not a USA  Company with respect to
any Pre-Closing Period shall be resolved in the USA  Seller\'s sole
discretion. Any disputes with respect to a decision to agree,  settle or
compromise any other issue referred to above shall be resolved in  the 
manner set forth in paragraph 16.10.

 



 

16.7 _Adjustments_

 

 

If  any  Tax Audit results in an increase in Taxes either to the USA Seller
(including  an  increase in the USA Seller's indemnification obligation
under this paragraph 16)  or to the Purchaser (including the USA Companies
which Taxes are not indemnified  under this paragraph 16), as the case may be
(the "Taxed Party"), and a  corresponding relief to the other party (the
"Benefiting Party"), the Benefiting  Party shall pay to the Taxed Party (or
shall reduce the Taxed Party's  indemnification obligation by) an amount
equal to the net present value of  such  relief. Any payment due under this
paragraph 16.7  shall be  made promptly, but in no event later than 10 days
following the date on which  the Taxed Party makes a payment to the
appropriate tax authority pursuant to  such Tax Audit.

 



 

16.8 _Tax  Sharing Agreements_

 

 

Any  tax  sharing agreement between the USA Seller and the USA Companies is
terminated  as  of the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any
taxable year  (whether the current year, a future year, or a past year).

 



 

16.9 _Carrybacks_

 

 

The  Purchaser shall cause the USA Companies to forego the carryback of any
item  of  Tax credit, regular net operating loss, alternative minimum tax
net operating  loss, capital loss or any other similar item generated in
taxable periods  beginning after the Closing Date to any Pre-Closing Period.

16.10 _Disputes_

 

 

Any  dispute covered by this paragraph 16.10 shall be resolved by an
independent  accounting firm. The parties shall instruct such firm to reach
its conclusion  regarding any such dispute within a reasonable period of time
(not to exceed  thirty days) after its appointment. The report of the
independent accounting  firm shall be , binding and conclusive on the USA
Seller and the Purchaser.  The  fees and expenses of such firm shall be
borne equally by the USA Seller and  the  Purchaser.

 



 

16.11 _Exclusivity_

 

 

This  paragraph 16 (along with paragraphs 1.1, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5 and 7.2(a) to
(d)  inclusive) shall be the sole and exclusive provision governing matters
relating  to the Taxes of the USA Companies, and no other provision of this
Schedule  shall  apply to the USA Companies.

 



 

16.12 _Survival_

 

 

The  USA  Sellers' indemnification obligations under this paragraph 16 shall
survive until  the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any  extensions thereof) and shall have no further effect
thereafter; provided that  if a claim or notice for indemnification is given
under this paragraph prior  to  any such expiration date, the claim with
respect to such indemnification shall  continue indefinitely until such claim
is resolved.

 

 

**17.** **Netherlands **

 

 

The  Dutch  Seller and the Purchaser shall procure that, if there are any
losses  attributable to the Dutch Companies, the Dutch Seller and the Dutch
Companies  shall file a request pursuant to article 15af of the Netherlands
Corporate  Income Tax Act 1969 that, following the dissolution of the Dutch
Companies  from  the fiscal unity with the Dutch Seller, all tax losses of
the fiscal unity  attributable to the Dutch Companies shall be available to
the Dutch Companies  to  offset future taxable income.
