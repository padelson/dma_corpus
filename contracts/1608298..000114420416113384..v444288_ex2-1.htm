(b) At or prior to the First Effective Time, the Company will cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Conversion Shares and Company Shares, the consideration payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) in relation to the Conversion Shares only, and upon registration
in the register of members, in relation to the Company Shares, pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article IV_. Following the Second Effective
Time, the Company will make available to the Exchange Agent, when and as
needed, cash sufficient to pay the cash portion of any consideration payable
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_. All cash and book-entry
shares representing Company Ordinary Shares deposited by the Company with the
Exchange Agent for distribution pursuant to this Article IV are referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
Company, deliver the appropriate consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent will
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Company;
_provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon will affect the
consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article IV_ and the Company will promptly cause to be
provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
Conversion Shares or Company Shares in the amount of any such losses. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments will be the
property of, and paid to, the Company.

  



  

(c) Each holder of Conversion Shares upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and each
holder of Company Shares upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto and, in each case, such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the consideration payable upon due surrender, in the
case of the Conversion Shares only, of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IV_ , that such holder has the right to receive; _provided_ , that
any TRTL Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be
uncertificated shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "),
and provided also that ownership of Company Shares is evidenced only by
registration in the register of members of the Company. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any consideration payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_.

  



  

(d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered or
in whose name the shares are registered in the Company\'s register of members,
as applicable, it will be a condition of such payment that the Person
requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or shares registered in the
Company\'s register of members or will establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

TRTL Class A Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Exchange Agent or TRTL Parent, they will be cancelled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Article IV_.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Conversion Shares or Company Shares one year after the
First Effective Time will be returned by the Exchange Agent to the Company,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her Conversion
Shares for the consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_ prior to that time will
thereafter look only to the Company for delivery of consideration
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article IV_ in respect of such holder's Conversion Shares or Company
Shares, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be
liable to any holder of Conversion Shares or Company Shares for any
consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article IV_ delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any consideration payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_
remaining unclaimed by holders of Conversion Shares or Company Shares
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Company free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) Dividends payable by the Company with respect to Company
Ordinary Shares will only be paid to holders of Company Ordinary Shares as
registered on the register of members of the Company at the time that such
dividends are declared.

and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld (and paid to the applicable Governmental
Authority) by the Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(i) In the event any Certificates relating to Conversion Shares
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such consideration as may be
required pursuant to Article IV __ and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Article IV; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement
of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or, if
reasonably required by the Company, a bond in such reasonable sum as the
Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Company or the Exchange Agent in respect of such Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

of TRTL Class A Common Stock subject to each such TRTL Warrant immediately
prior to the First Effective Time; (b) shall have an exercise price of $5.75
with two warrants required to purchase one Company Ordinary Share; and (c)

Section 6.6 _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) There is at least $212,750,000 (less, as of the Closing,
payments to Redeeming Stockholders) invested in a trust account (the "
_Trust Account_ ") maintained by the Trustee, pursuant to the Investment
Management Trust Account Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2014, between TRTL
and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is valid and
in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms and has
not been amended or modified. There are no separate agreements, side letters
or other agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express
or implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the
TRTL Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect and/or that would
entitle any Person (other than stockholders of TRTL holding shares of TRTL
Common Stock sold in TRTL's initial public offering who shall have elected to
redeem their shares of TRTL Common Stock pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to
the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released
except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the TRTL Organizational
Documents and TRTL's final prospectus dated July 16, 2014. Amounts in the
Trust Account are invested in United States "government securities" within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. TRTL has performed
all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is
not in material default or delinquent in performance or any other respect
(claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and, to the
knowledge of TRTL, no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a material default thereunder. There are
no claims or proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account. Since
July 22, 2014, TRTL has not released any money from the Trust Account (other
than interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Account as
permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Second Effective Time, the
obligations of TRTL to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the TRTL
Organizational Documents shall terminate, and as of the Second Effective
Time, TRTL shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the TRTL
Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of TRTL by
reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
following the Second Effective Time, no TRTL Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such TRTL
Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder.

  



    

40

 



    



  

(b) As of the date hereof, assuming (i) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained herein, (ii) the
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and (iii) the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the parties
contained herein, none of TRTL, TRTL Parent or TRTL Merger Sub has any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to the Company on the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Brokers ' Fees_. Except for fees described on
_Schedule 6.7_ (which fees shall be the sole responsibility of TRTL) or
_Exhibit E_ , no broker, finder, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage fee, finders' fee or other commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by TRTL, TRTL Parent, TRTL Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates

  



  

Section 6.8 _TRTL Reports; Financial Statements and Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_.

  



  

(a) TRTL has timely filed in all material respects all required
registration statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since July 16, 2014
(collectively, as they have been amended since the time of their filing and
including all exhibits thereto, the " _TRTL Reports_ "). None of the TRTL
Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on
the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements (including, in
each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in the TRTL Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to
unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present
(subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included
therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete
footnotes) in all material respects the financial position of TRTL as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for
the respective periods then ended.

  



  

(b) TRTL has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to TRTL is made known to TRTL's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the periods
in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being
prepared. To TRTL's knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting TRTL's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in TRTL's
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c) TRTL has established and maintained a system of internal
controls over financial reporting. Such internal controls are sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of TRTL's financial
reporting and the preparation of TRTL's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

  



    

41

 



    



  

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit
made by TRTL to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) or director of TRTL. TRTL has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(a) Since its incorporation, TRTL has not conducted any business
activities other than activities directed toward the accomplishment of
a Business Combination and there has not been a TRTL Material Adverse Effect.

agreement, commitment, or Governmental Order binding upon TRTL or to which
TRTL is a party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect
of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of TRTL, any acquisition of
property by TRTL or the conduct of business by TRTL as currently conducted or
as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing other than such
effects which would not be a TRTL Material Adverse Effect.

investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, business, trust or other entity.

  



  

(c) The stock of TRTL is not a U.S. real property interest within
the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code, and at or within the 30 days of
the Closing, TRTL shall deliver a certificate to such effect to the Company,
which certificate shall be provided pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) and shall conform to Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h).

  



  

Section 6.10 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration
Statement_. None of the information relating to TRTL, TRTL Parent or TRTL
Merger Sub supplied by TRTL, TRTL Parent or TRTL Merger Sub, or by any other
Person acting on behalf of TRTL, TRTL Parent or TRTL Merger Sub, in
writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration
Statement will, as of the date the Registration Statement is made effective,

or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by TRTL, the Company or TRTL Parent which should be set forth in

Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the TRTL Stockholders.
TRTL Parent, TRTL and the Company will advise the other parties hereto

Parent, the Company and TRTL shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts, after consultation with each other, to resolve all such requests or

Parent, the Company and TRTL shall notify each other promptly of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance of any stop
order or suspension of the qualification of the Company Ordinary Shares
issuable in connection with the Second Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments

are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

  



  

(c) Each of the Company and the First Surviving Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect for six years from

restructure transactions contemplated hereby as a result of tax, accounting,
governance or other considerations, as may be mutually agreed by TRTL and the
Company, subject to _Section 12.10_. The parties also recognize that an
alternative transaction structure may necessitate changes in certain terms of
this Agreement, but no such changes shall result in a change in the value of
the consideration to be received by the stockholders of TRTL or the
shareholders of the Company or shall be effected other than in compliance with

Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
11.1_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under this Agreement, and (b) the right to seek specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor TRTL would have entered into this
Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 12.13_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such injunction.

Section 12.15 _Shareholders ' Representative_. The parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time (the " _Shareholders_ ") for certain limited purposes, as specified
herein (the " _Shareholders ' Representative_"). The Shareholders hereby
designate Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the initial
Shareholders' Representative. The Shareholders' Representative may resign at
any time, and the Shareholders' Representative may be removed by the vote of
Persons which collectively owned more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company
Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Second Effective Time,
voting together as a single class on an as converted basis to Company
Ordinary Shares (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a
Shareholders' Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Shareholders'
Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such
appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new
Shareholders' Representative. The Shareholders' Representative shall have
such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the
functions assigned to it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Shareholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Shareholders except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Shareholders' Representative shall have full
power, authority and discretion to, after the Second Effective Time (i)
negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement for and on behalf of
the Shareholders, (ii) give and receive notices and other communications
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby on behalf
of the Shareholders, (iii) take or refrain from taking any actions (whether
by negotiation, settlement, litigation or otherwise) to resolve or settle all
matters and disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any disputes related to the
Earnout Payments, in each case on behalf of the Shareholders and (iv) take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Shareholders' Representative shall have no liability to TRTL, TRTL Parent,
the Company or any Shareholder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken, except to the extent arising out of the Shareholders' Representative's
fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement solely from the Shareholders for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Shareholders'
Representative. The Shareholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Shareholders' Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Shareholders' Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Shareholders' Representative, the Shareholders'
Representative will reimburse the Shareholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Shareholders' Representative
by the Shareholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Shareholders' Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund, and (ii)
from any Earnout Amount at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Shareholders; provided, that while this section allows
the Shareholders' Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the
Earnout Amount, this does not relieve the Shareholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Shareholders' Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Shareholders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Shareholders or otherwise. The Shareholders acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Shareholders' Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

In order to induce the Company and Yatra to proceed with the consummation of
the Transactions and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of Apple Orange LLC,

director or member of the Company's management team (each, an " _Insider_ "
and collectively, the " _Insiders_ "), hereby agrees with the Company as

1. Each Sponsor and each Insider agrees that immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions, it or he shall surrender and forfeit to the Company such number of shares of Class F Common Stock of the Company as is set forth opposite such person's name on _Exhibit A_ hereto. Each Sponsor and Insider hereby authorizes the Company to take such actions as shall be necessary to evidence such surrender and forfeiture as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

2. This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

  



  

3. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except as provided above.

Any transfer made in contravention of this Letter Agreement shall be null and void.

The parties hereto (i) all agree that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the courts of New York City, in the State of New York, and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waives any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



    



 



    



  

5. This Letter Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission or by electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

amendments, supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein

_Section 2.1.1_ above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith (i)
as may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective

disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness
Period and (ii) to include the registration for resale from time to time by
Investors any Earn-Out Shares as soon as reasonably practicable following
issuance thereof.

  



  

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in

registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
amendments to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the
Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and
file a new registration statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), in
either case covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to
be registered by the Commission, on Form F-3 or such other form available to
register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering;
provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration
Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of
all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-
available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the
Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "), including without limitation, the
Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a
limitation of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be

(and notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with
the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable
Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a holder as to its
Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered
on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on
the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Investors, subject to a
determination by the Commission that certain Investors must be reduced first
based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Investors. In the
event the Company amends the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a
New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with
the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided
to the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form F-3 or such other form available to register
for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale
on the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New
Registration Statement.

2.1.5 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify
the Investors in writing of any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to, or additional information in connection with, the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement required to be prepared and filed
hereunder (or Prospectus relating thereto). The Company shall promptly notify
each Investor in writing of the filing of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or any Prospectus, amendment or supplement related thereto or any
post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the
effectiveness of any post-effective amendment.

  



  

(a) If the Company shall receive a request from (x) the holders of
at least 2,000,000 shares of Registrable Securities, provided that the
estimated market value of the Registrable Securities is at least $20,000,000
(the requesting holder(s) shall be referred to herein as the " _Requesting
Holder_ ") that the Company effect the Underwritten Takedown of all or any
portion of the Requesting Holder's Registrable Securities, and specifying the
intended method of disposition thereof, then the Company shall promptly give
notice of such requested Underwritten Takedown (each such request shall be
referred to herein as a " _Demand Takedown_ ") at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the anticipated filing date of the prospectus or supplement
relating to such Demand Takedown to the other Investors and thereupon shall
use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as possible, the
offering in such Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested such
offering under _Section 2.1.5(a)_ , and

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
other Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities (all
such holders, together with the Requesting Holder, the " _Selling Holders_ ")
have requested the Company to offer by request received by the Company within
seven Business Days after such holders receive the Company's notice of the
Demand Takedown, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in
accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable
Securities so to be offered.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the expiration of the seven-Business Day-period
referred to in _Section 2.1.5(a)(ii)_ , the Company will notify all Selling
Holders of the identities of the other Selling Holders and the number of
shares of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



  

(c) The Company shall only be required to effectuate one
Underwritten Takedown within any six-month period.

  



    

7

 



    



  

(d) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises
the Company and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having
an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares
can be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be
reduced by the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on
a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by
such Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Investors must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Investors).

  



  

2.1.6 _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling Holders holding a majority
in interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which
Underwriter or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In
connection with an Underwritten Takedown, the Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form)
and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Takedown, including, if necessary, the engagement of a
"qualified independent underwriter" in connection with the qualification of
the underwriting arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.

  



  

2.1.7 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall not
be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

  



  

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time
after the expiration of a lock-up to which such shares are subject, if any,
(i) (a) MIHI LLC (the " _Macquarie Demanding Holders_ ") in the case of a
Macquarie Demand (as defined below), (b) the Terrapin Founders (the "
_Terrapin Founders Demanding Holders_ " and collectively with the Macquarie
Demanding Holders, the " _Terrapin Demanding Holders_ ") in the case of a
Terrapin Founders Demand (as defined below) or (c) a majority-in-interest of
the Terrapin Demanding Holders in the case of a Terrapin Demand (as
defined below) or (ii) a [majority-in-interest] of [Insert Yatra Investors
who need Demand Rights] (______________ and collectively
with___________________, the " _Yatra Demanding Holders_ "), as the case may
be, may make a written demand for Registration under the Securities Act of
all or any portion of their Exchange Shares or Business Combination Shares or
other Registrable Securities, as applicable, on Form F-1 or any similar long-
form Registration or, if then available, on Form F-3. Each registration
requested pursuant to this _Section 2.2.1_ is referred to herein as a "
_Demand Registration_ ". Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify
the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will notify all
Investors that are holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and
each such holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a
portion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration
(each such holder including shares of Registrable Securities in such
registration, a " _Demanding Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company within
fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the holder of the notice from the
Company. Upon any such request, the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to
have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand Registration,
subject to _Section 2.2.4_ and the provisos set forth in _Section 3.1.1_. The
Company shall not be obligated to effect more than an aggregate of (i) one
(1) Demand Registration under this Section 2.2.1 in respect of all
Registrable Securities held by the Macquarie Demanding Holders (the "
_Macquarie Demand_ "), (ii) one (1) Demand Registration under this Section
2.2.1 in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the Terrapin Founders
Demanding Holders (the " _Terrapin Founders Demand_ "), (iii) one (1) Demand
Registration under this _Section 2.2.1_ in respect of all
Registrable Securities held by Terrapin Demanding Holders (the " _Terrapin
Demand_ ") and (iv) three (3) Demand Registrations under this _Section 2.2.1_
in respect of all Registrable Securities held by Yatra Demanding Holders.

  



    

8

 



    



  

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a
Demand Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to such Demand Registration has been declared
effective and the Company has complied with all of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such
Registration Statement has been declared effective, the offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by
any stop order or injunction of the Commission or any other governmental
agency or court, the Registration Statement with respect to such Demand
Registration will be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering; provided, further, that
the Company shall not be obligated to file a second Registration Statement
until a Registration Statement that has been filed is counted as a Demand
Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. If the [Terrapin Demanding Holders
or Yatra Demanding Holders] so elect and such holders so advise the Company
as part of their written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of
such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in
the form of an underwritten offering. In such event, the right of any holder
to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be
conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the
inclusion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the
extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the holders initiating the Demand
Registration, and subject to the approval of the Company.

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering
advises the Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar
amount or number of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding
Holders desire to sell, taken together with all other Ordinary Shares or other
securities which the Company desires to sell and the Ordinary Shares, if any,
as to which registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights held by other shareholders of the Company who
desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of
shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the
probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of shares, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "), then
the Company shall include in such registration: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities as to which Demand Registration has been requested by the
Demanding Holders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares that each
such Person has requested be included in such registration, regardless of the
number of shares held by each such Person (such proportion is referred to
herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Ordinary
Shares or other securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (iii) third, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), the Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account
of other persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to
written contractual arrangements with such persons, as to which "piggy-back"
registration has been requested by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



    

9

 



    



  

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to include
all of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering by
giving written notice to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of
their request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration.
If the majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a
proposed offering relating to a Demand Registration, then either the Demanding
Holders shall reimburse the Company for the costs associated with the
withdrawn registration (in which case such registration shall not count as a
Demand Registration provided for in _Section 2.1_ ) or the withdrawn
registration shall count as a Demand Registration provided for in _Section
2.1_.

  



  

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time after [___], the Company
proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with
respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity
securities, by the Company for its own account or for shareholders of the
Company for their account (or by the Company and by shareholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ), other
than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock
option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Company's existing shareholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company or
(iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x) give
written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable
Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days
before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a " _Piggy-
Back Registration_ "). The Company shall cause such Registrable Securities to
be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-
Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities
of the Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to
distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an
Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-
Back Registration.

  

  



    

10

 



    



  

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten
offering advises the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in
writing that the dollar amount or number of Ordinary Shares which the Company
desires to sell, taken together with Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which
registration has been demanded pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder and
the Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested under
this _Section 2.3_ , exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then the
Company shall include in any such registration:

  



  

(a) If the registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A)
first, the Ordinary Shares or other securities that the Company desires to
sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (A), the Ordinary Shares or other securities, if
any, comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares, Pro Rata; and (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Ordinary Shares or other securities for the
account of other persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant
to written contractual piggy-back registration rights with such persons and
that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and

  



  

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the
demand of persons other than either the holders of Registrable Securities,
(A) first, the Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of the
demanding persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Ordinary Shares or other
securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B), the Ordinary Shares or other securities, if any, comprised of
Registrable Securities, Pro Rata, as to which registration has been requested
pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the
Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of other persons that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with such persons, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares.

  



    

11

 



    



  

2.3.3 _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal
by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company
shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in _Section 3.3_.

  



  

2.3.4 _Registrations on Form F-3_. The holders of Registrable
Securities may at any time and from time to time, but not more often than two
(2) times per calendar year, request in writing that the Company register the
resale of any or all of such Registrable Securities on Form F-3 or any
similar short-form registration which may be available at such time (" _Form
F-3_ "); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect
such request through an underwritten offering. Within five (5) Business Days
of the Company's receipt of such written request, the Company will give
written notice of the proposed registration to all other holders of
Registrable Securities, and, as soon as practicable thereafter but not more
than thirty (30) days after the Company's initial receipt of such written
request for Registration on Form F-3, effect the registration of all or
such portion of such holder's or Registrable Securities as are specified in
such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities
or other securities of the Company, if any, of any other holder or holders
joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within
ten (10) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
registration pursuant to this _Section 2.3.4_ : (i) if Form F-3 is not
available for such offering; or (ii) if the holders of the Registrable
Securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the
public of less than $[5,000,000]. Registrations effected pursuant to this 
_Section 2.3.4_ shall not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant
to _Section 2.1_.

Registration relates, in each case if the Company shall furnish to the
holders a certificate signed by the President or Chairman of the Company
stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
shareholders for such Registration Statement to be effected at such time;
provided further, however, that the Company shall not have the right to

4. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable
Securities, and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates,
directors, partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any,
who controls an Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) (each, an " _Investor Indemnified Party_ "), from and against
any expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether
joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or
allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered
under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment
or supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon
any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending
any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company, in writing, by such selling holder expressly for use therein, or
is based on any selling holder's violation of the federal securities laws
(including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable Securities in
accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the prospectus.

  



    

17

 



    



  

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
selling holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any
registration is being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such selling
holder, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and
officers, and each other selling holder and each other person, if any, who
controls another selling holder within the meaning of the Securities Act,
against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint
or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable
Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to
the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or
the alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use
therein, or is based on any selling holder's violation of the federal
securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the
prospectus, and shall reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and
each other selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling
holder's indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint
and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by
such selling holder.

  



    

18

 



    



  

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after
receipt by any person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or
liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant
to _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ , such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for
indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or
action; provided, however, that the failure by the Indemnified Party to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party
hereunder, except and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided,
however, that in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate
counsel, which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) to
represent the Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be
subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity
may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with
the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party
if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party,
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party
shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could
have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim or proceeding.

  



  

4.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.3_ is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in
respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein,
then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the
actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of any Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such Indemnified Party or
such Indemnifying Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.

  



  

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.4.2_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding _Section 4.4.1_.

  



    

19

 



    



  

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 4.4_ , no
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any
underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by
such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such
contribution obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

5. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION.

  



  

5.1 _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and shall take such further action as the holders of Registrable
Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such holders to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended
from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
Commission.

shall provide the highest level of support for the election of such Yatra
Nominee as they provide to any other individual standing for election as a
director of the Company as part of the Company's slate of directors.

by such Investor, or over which such Investor has voting control, and

Prior Agreement and any similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof. The
Company shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its

8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the Corporation shall

for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the

modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect
of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment,

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer
of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay
all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or
otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred
by this _Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 8.2(a)_ , except for proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this _Section 8.2_ ,
shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the
extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when
such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of,
or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This Section 8.2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall
not apply with respect to any officers or directors of the Corporation,
in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict
with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the
date of this Certificate of Incorporation or in the future. In addition to the
foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other
corporate opportunity with respect to any of the officers or directors of the
Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person
solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the
Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and
contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for
the Corporation to pursue.

  



  

ARTICLE X

  

AMENDMENT OF

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL;
_provided_ , that any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation which affects the rights,

of the outstanding shares of Class F Common Stock, voting as a separate
class; and, except as set forth in _Article VIII_ , all rights,
preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or
any other persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its
present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved
in this _Article X_.

---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.1| If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into
different classes of Shares, all or any of the rights attached to any class
(unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class)
may, whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied without the
consent of the holders of the issued Shares of that class where
such variation is considered by the Directors not to have a material adverse
effect upon such rights; otherwise, any such variation shall be made only
with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the
issued Shares of that class, or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a
majority of not less than two thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting
of the holders of the Shares of that class. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Directors reserve the right, notwithstanding that any such variation may not
have a material adverse effect, to obtain consent from the holders of Shares
of the relevant class. To any such meeting all the provisions of the Articles
relating to general meetings shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ , except that the
necessary quorum shall be one person holding or representing by proxy at
least one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of
Shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. 
---|---|---

   | 12.2| For the purposes of a separate class meeting, the Directors may
treat two or more or all the classes of Shares as forming one class of Shares
if the Directors consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the
same way by the proposals under consideration, but in any other case shall
treat them as separate classes of Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.3| The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any class
issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly
provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class, be deemed to be
varied by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu
therewith. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13| Commission on Sale of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company may, in so far as the Statute permits, pay a commission to any
person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe (whether
absolutely or conditionally) or procuring or agreeing to procure
subscriptions (whether absolutely or conditionally) for any Shares.
Such commissions may be satisfied by the payment of cash and/or the issue of
fully or partly paid-up Shares. The Company may also on any issue of Shares
pay such brokerage as may be lawful.

  



   | 14| Non Recognition of Trusts 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way (even
when notified) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any
Share, or (except only as is otherwise provided by the Articles or the
Statute) any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute
right to the entirety thereof in the holder.

  



   | 15| Lien on Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.1| The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on all Shares
(whether fully paid-up or not) registered in the name of a Member (whether
solely or jointly with others) for all debts, liabilities or engagements to or
with the Company (whether presently payable or not) by such Member or his
estate, either alone or jointly with any other person, whether a Member or
not, but the Directors may at any time declare any Share to be wholly or in
part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The registration of a
transfer of any such Share shall operate as a waiver of the Company\'s lien
thereon. The Company\'s lien on a Share shall also extend to any amount
payable in respect of that Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.2| The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit,
any Shares on which the Company has a lien, if a sum in respect of which the
lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen clear days
after notice has been received or deemed to have been received by the holder
of the Shares, or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of the holder, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is
not complied with the Shares may be sold. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.3| To give effect to any such sale the Directors may authorise any
person to execute an instrument of transfer of the Shares sold to, or in
accordance with the directions of, the purchaser. The purchaser or his nominee
shall be registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any such
transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase
money, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or
invalidity in the sale or the exercise of the Company\'s power of sale under
the Articles. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

10

 



    



   | 15.4| The net proceeds of such sale after payment of costs, shall be
applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien
exists as is presently payable and any balance shall (subject to a like lien
for sums not presently payable as existed upon the Shares before the sale) be
paid to the person entitled to the Shares at the date of the sale. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16| Call on Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.1| Subject to the terms of the allotment and issue of any Shares,
the Directors may make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid
on their Shares (whether in respect of par value or premium), and each Member
shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen clear days\' notice specifying
the time or times of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times so
specified the amount called on the Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed,
in whole or in part, as the Directors may determine. A call may be required
to be paid by instalments. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain
liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the
Shares in respect of which the call was made. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.2| A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the
resolution of the Directors authorising such call was passed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.3| The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.4| If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable,
the person from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from
the day it became due and payable until it is paid at such rate as the
Directors may determine (and in addition all expenses that have been incurred
by the Company by reason of such non-payment), but the Directors may
waive payment of the interest or expenses wholly or in part. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.5| An amount payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or
at any fixed date, whether on account of the par value of the Share or
premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all
the provisions of the Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due
and payable by virtue of a call. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.6| The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the
amount and times of payment of calls, or the interest to be paid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.7| The Directors may, if they think fit, receive an amount from any
Member willing to advance all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid
upon any Shares held by him, and may (until the amount would otherwise become
payable) pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the
Directors and the Member paying such amount in advance. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

11

 



    



   | 16.8| No such amount paid in advance of calls shall entitle the Member
paying such amount to any portion of a Dividend or other distribution payable
in respect of any period prior to the date upon which such amount would, but
for such payment, become payable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17| Forfeiture of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.1| If a call or instalment of a call remains unpaid after it has
become due and payable the Directors may give to the person from whom it is
due not less than fourteen clear days\' notice requiring payment of the amount
unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any expenses
incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice
shall specify where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice
is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be
liable to be forfeited. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.2| If the notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of
which it was given may, before the payment required by the notice has been
made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall
include all Dividends, other distributions or other monies payable in respect
of the forfeited Share and not paid before the forfeiture. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.3| A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed
of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and at any
time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be
cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of
its disposal a forfeited Share is to be transferred to any person the
Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of
the Share in favour of that person. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.4| A person any of whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to
be a Member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for
cancellation the certificate for the Shares forfeited and shall remain liable
to pay to the Company all monies which at the date of forfeiture were payable
by him to the Company in respect of those Shares together with interest at
such rate as the Directors may determine, but his liability shall cease if and
when the Company shall have received payment in full of all monies due and
payable by him in respect of those Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.5| A certificate in writing under the hand of one Director or
officer of the Company that a Share has been forfeited on a specified date
shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons
claiming to be entitled to the Share. The certificate shall (subject to the
execution of an instrument of transfer) constitute a good title to the Share
and the person to whom the Share is sold or otherwise disposed of shall not be
bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his
title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the
proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.6| The provisions of the Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in
the case of non payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share,
becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the
Share or by way of premium as if it had been payable by virtue of a call duly
made and notified. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

12

 



    



   | 18| Transmission of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.1| If a Member dies the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint
holder) or his legal personal representatives (where he was a sole holder),
shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his
Shares. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any
liability in respect of any Share, for which he was a joint or sole holder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.2| Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the
death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any
other way than by transfer) may, upon such evidence being produced as may be
required by the Directors, elect, by a notice in writing sent by him to the
Company, either to become the holder of such Share or to have some person
nominated by him registered as the holder of such Share. If he elects to have
another person registered as the holder of such Share he shall sign an
instrument of transfer of that Share to that person. The Directors shall, in
either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they
would have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant
Member before his death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution, as the
case may be. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.3| A person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other case
than by transfer) shall be entitled to the same Dividends, other distributions
and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of
such Share. However, he shall not, before becoming a Member in respect of a
Share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by
membership in relation to general meetings of the Company and the Directors
may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect either to be
registered himself or to have some person nominated by him be registered as
the holder of the Share (but the Directors shall, in either case, have the
same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the
case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member before his death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution or any other case than by transfer,
as the case may be). If the notice is not complied with within ninety days of
being received or deemed to be received (as determined pursuant to the
Articles) the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all Dividends,
other distributions, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the
Share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

the Articles as regards the matters to be dealt with by Ordinary Resolution,

   | (b)| alter or add to the Articles;

other manner if any as may be prescribed by the Company, provided that a
general meeting of the Company shall, whether or not the notice specified in
this Article has been given and whether or not the provisions of the Articles
regarding general meetings have been complied with, be deemed to have been
duly convened if it is so agreed: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the Members
entitled to attend and vote thereat; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, by a majority in

---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.2| The accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to,
or the non receipt of notice of a general meeting by, any person entitled to
receive such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings of that general
meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23| Advance Notice for Business 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23.1| No business may be transacted at an annual general meeting,
other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of the annual
general meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of
the Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual general
meeting by or at the direction of the Directors or (iii) otherwise properly
brought before the annual general meeting by any Member (x) who is a Member of
record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Article
22.1 and on the record date for the determination of Members entitled to vote

procedures set forth in this Article 22.1. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article 22.1 to the contrary, only persons nominated for election as a
Director to fill any term of a Directorship that expires on the date of the
annual general meeting pursuant to these Articles will be considered for
election at such meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business
(other than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual general
meeting by a Member, such Member must have given timely notice thereof in
proper written form to the Secretary of the Company and such business must
otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action. Subject to Article 22.1
(c)(iii), a Member\'s notice to the Secretary with respect to such business,
to be timely, must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the 90th day
nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the
anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual general meeting;
provided, however, that in the event that the annual general meeting is
called for a date that is not within 45 days before or after such

earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the annual
general meeting and not later than the later of (x) the close of business on
the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual
general meeting is first made by the Company. The public announcement of an
adjournment of an annual general meeting shall not commence a new time
period for the giving of a shareholder\'s notice as described in this Article
22.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

15

 



    



   | (b)| To be in proper written form, a Member\'s notice to the Secretary
with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to
each such matter such Member proposes to bring before the annual general
meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
the annual general meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including
the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such
business includes a proposal to amend these Articles, the language of the
proposed amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
general meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such shareholder and the
name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital
share of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such
shareholder and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal
is made, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between
such Member and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection
with the proposal of such business by such Member, (v) any material interest
of such Member and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal
is made in such business and (vi) a representation that such Member intends
to appear in person or by proxy at the annual general meeting to bring such
business before the annual general meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The foregoing notice requirements of this Article 22.1 shall be
deemed satisfied by a Member as to any proposal (other than nominations) if
the Member has notified the Company of such Member\'s intention to present
such proposal at an annual general meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or
any successor thereof) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such Member has complied with the
requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy statement
prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual general
meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual general meeting except
business brought before the annual general meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article 22.1, provided, however, that once
business has been properly brought before the annual general meeting in
accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Article 22.1 shall be deemed
to preclude discussion by any Member of any such business. If the Directors
or the chairman of the annual general meeting determines that any Member
proposal was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Article 22.1
or that the information provided in a Member\'s notice does not satisfy the
information requirements of this Article 22.1, such proposal shall not be
presented for action at the annual general meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article 22.1, if the Member (or a qualified
representative of the Member) does not appear at the annual general meeting
to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not
be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may
have been received by the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

16

 



    



   | (d)| In addition to the provisions of this Article 22.1, a Member
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this Article 22.1 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
Members to request inclusion of proposals in the Company\'s proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23.2| Only such business shall be conducted at an extraordinary
general meeting as shall have been brought before the extraordinary general
meeting pursuant to the notice of extraordinary general meeting. Nominations
of persons for election to the Directors may be made at an extraordinary
general meeting at which Directors are to be elected pursuant to the notice
of extraordinary general meeting only pursuant to these Articles. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23.3| For purposes of these Articles, "public announcement" shall mean

   | 24.2| A person may participate at a general meeting by conference
telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all the persons

appointed for the meeting to commence or if during such a meeting a quorum
ceases to be present, the meeting, if convened upon a Members\' requisition,

quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the
meeting to commence, the Members present shall be a quorum. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.4| The Directors may, at any time prior to the time appointed for
the meeting to commence, appoint any person to act as chairman of a general
meeting of the Company or, if the Directors do not make any such appointment,
the chairman, if any, of the board of Directors shall preside as chairman at
such general meeting. If there is no such chairman, or if he shall not be
present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to
commence, or is unwilling to act, the Directors present shall elect one of
their number to be chairman of the meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

17

 



    



   | 24.5| If no Director is willing to act as chairman or if no Director
is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to
commence, the Members present shall choose one of their number to be chairman
of the meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.6| The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a
quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the
meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be
transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished
at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.7| When a general meeting is adjourned for thirty days or more,
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original
meeting. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to give any such notice of an
adjourned meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.8| A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on
a poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.9| A poll shall be taken as the chairman directs, and the result of
the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general meeting at which
the poll was demanded. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.10| A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question
of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other
question shall be taken at such date, time and place as the chairman of the
general meeting directs, and any business other than that upon which a poll
has been demanded or is contingent thereon may proceed pending the taking
of the poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.11| In the case of an equality of votes the chairman shall be
entitled to a second or casting vote. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25| Votes of Members 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.1| Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any Shares,
every Member present in any such manner shall have one vote for every Share
of which he is the holder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.2| In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior holder who
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy (or, in the case of a
corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorised representative
or proxy), shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint
holders, and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of
the holders stand in the Register of Members. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.3| A Member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has
been made by any court, having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote by his
committee, receiver, curator bonis, or other person on such Member\'s behalf
appointed by that court, and any such committee, receiver, curator bonis or
other person may vote by proxy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.4| No person shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting
unless he is registered as a Member on the record date for such meeting nor
unless all calls or other monies then payable by him in respect of Shares have
been paid. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

18

 



    



   | 25.5| No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any
voter except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the

and/or abstain from voting a Share or some or all of the Shares and, subject
to the terms of the instrument appointing him, a proxy appointed under one or
more instruments may vote a Share or some or all of the Shares in respect of
which he is appointed either for or against a resolution and/or abstain from

be executed under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly
authorised in writing, or, if the appointor is a corporation or other non
natural person, under the hand of its duly authorised representative. A proxy
need not be a Member.

   | 26.2| The Directors may, in the notice convening any meeting or
adjourned meeting, or in an instrument of proxy sent out by the Company,
specify the manner by which the instrument appointing a proxy shall be
deposited and the place and the time (being not later than the time appointed

convening any meeting or adjourned meeting or in an instrument of proxy sent
out by the Company, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited
physically at the Registered Office not less than 48 hours before the time
appointed for the meeting or adjourned meeting to commence at which the
person named in the instrument proposes to vote. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 26.3| The chairman may in any event at his discretion declare that an
instrument of proxy shall be deemed to have been duly deposited. An
instrument of proxy that is not deposited in the manner permitted, or which
has not been declared to have been duly deposited by the chairman, shall be
invalid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 26.4| The instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common
form (or such other form as the Directors may approve) and may be expressed
to be for a particular meeting or any adjournment thereof or generally until
revoked. An instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to include the
power to demand or join or concur in demanding a poll.

   | 26.5| Votes given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of
proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the
principal or revocation of the proxy or of the authority under which the proxy
was executed, or the transfer of the Share in respect of which the proxy is
given unless notice in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or
transfer was received by the Company at the Registered Office before the
commencement of the general meeting, or adjourned meeting at which it is
sought to use the proxy.

   | 27| Corporate Members 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 27.1| Any corporation or other non-natural person which is a Member
may in accordance with its constitutional documents, or in the absence of
such provision by resolution of its directors or other governing body,
authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any
meeting of the Company or of any class of Members, and the person so
authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the
corporation which he represents as the corporation could exercise if it were
an individual Member. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 27.2| If a clearing house (or its nominee(s)), being a corporation, is
a Member, it may authorise such persons as it sees fit to act as its
representative at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of any class of
Members provided that the authorisation shall specify the number and class of
Shares in respect of which each such representative is so authorised. Each
person so authorised under the provisions of this Article shall be deemed to
have been duly authorised without further evidence of the facts and be
entitled to exercise the same rights and powers on behalf of the clearing
house (or its nominee(s)) as if such person was the registered holder of such
Shares held by the clearing house (or its nominee(s)).

   | 30.1| Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Memorandum and the
Articles and to any directions given by Special Resolution, the business of

given. A duly convened meeting of Directors at which a quorum is present may
exercise all powers exercisable by the Directors. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 30.2| All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and

   | 31.1| The Directors shall be divided into three (3) classes designated
as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors shall be assigned
to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors. At the 201[6][7] annual general meeting of Members, the
term of office of the Class I Directors shall expire and Class I Directors
shall be elected for a full term of three (3) years. At the 201[7][8] annual
general meeting of Members, the term of office of the Class II Directors
shall expire and Class II Directors shall be elected for a full term of three
(3) years. At the 201[8][9] annual general meeting of Members, the term of
office of the Class III Directors shall expire and Class III Directors shall
be elected for a full term of three (3) years. At each succeeding annual
general meeting of Members, Directors shall be elected for a full term of
three (3) years to succeed the Directors of the class whose terms expire at
such annual general meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article, each Director shall hold office until the expiration of his term,
until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his
earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of
Directors constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent
Director.

   | 31.2| Any and all vacancies in the board of Directors, however
occurring, including, without limitation, by reason of an increase in the
size of the board of Directors, or the death, resignation, disqualification or
removal of a Director, shall be filled solely and exclusively by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even
if less than a quorum of the board of Directors, and not by the Members. Any
Director appointed in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which
the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such
Director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his
or her earlier resignation, death or removal. When the number of Directors is
increased or decreased, the board of Directors shall, subject to Article 31.1
hereof, determine the class or classes to which the increased or decreased
number of Directors shall be apportioned; provided, however, that no decrease
in the number of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director.
In the event of a vacancy in the board of Directors, the remaining Directors,
except as otherwise provided by law, shall exercise the powers of the full
board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.

the meeting.

of Directors as the case may be, duly convened and held.

   | 33.5| A Director may, or other officer of the Company on the direction

the giving of notices by the Company to the Members shall apply _mutatis
mutandis._ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 33.6| The continuing Directors (or a sole continuing Director, as the
case may be) may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but if and so
long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to the
Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors the continuing Directors or

but for no other purpose. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 33.7| The Directors may elect a chairman of their board and determine
the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is

after the time appointed for the meeting to commence, the Directors present
may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 33.8| All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee
of the Directors shall, notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that
there was some defect in the appointment of any Director, and/or that they or
any of them were disqualified, and/or had vacated their office and/or were
not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly

person acting as the chairman or secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered post to such
person immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent

---|---|--- 
  



   | 35.5| A general notice that a Director is a shareholder, director,
officer or employee of any specified firm or company and is to be regarded as
interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient

   | 41| Dividends, Distributions and Reserve 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.1| Subject to the Statute and this Article and except as otherwise
provided by the rights attached to any Shares, the Directors may resolve to
pay Dividends and other distributions on Shares in issue and authorise payment
of the Dividends or other distributions out of the funds of the Company
lawfully available therefor. A Dividend shall be deemed to be an interim
Dividend unless the terms of the resolution pursuant to which the Directors
resolve to pay such Dividend specifically state that such Dividend shall be a
final Dividend. No Dividend or other distribution shall be paid except out of
the realised or unrealised profits of the Company, out of the share premium
account or as otherwise permitted by the Statute. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

26

 



    



   | 41.2| Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any
Shares, all Dividends and other distributions shall be paid according to the

payable to any Member all sums of money (if any) then payable by him to the
Company on account of calls or otherwise. 
---|---|---

distribution be paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets
and in particular (but without limitation) by the distribution of shares,
debentures, or securities of any other company or in any one or more of such
ways and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the
Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and in particular may
issue fractional Shares and may fix the value for distribution of such
specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall
be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to
adjust the rights of all Members and may vest any such specific assets in
trustees in such manner as may seem expedient to the Directors. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.5| Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any
Shares, Dividends and other distributions may be paid in any currency. The
Directors may determine the basis of conversion for any currency conversions
that may be required and how any costs involved are to be met. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.6| The Directors may, before resolving to pay any Dividend or other
distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or
reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for
any purpose of the Company and pending such application may, at the
discretion of the Directors, be employed in the business of the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.7| Any Dividend, other distribution, interest or other monies
payable in cash in respect of Shares may be paid by wire transfer to the
holder or by cheque or warrant sent through the post directed to the
registered address of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the
registered address of the holder who is first named on the Register of
Members or to such person and to such address as such holder or joint holders
may in writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to
the order of the person to whom it is sent. Any one of two or more joint
holders may give effectual receipts for any Dividends, other distributions,
bonuses, or other monies payable in respect of the Share held by them as joint
holders.

   | 41.8| No Dividend or other distribution shall bear interest against
the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.9| Any Dividend or other distribution which cannot be paid to a
Member and/or which remains unclaimed after six months from the date on which
such Dividend or other distribution becomes payable may, in the discretion of
the Directors, be paid into a separate account in the Company\'s name,
provided that the Company shall not be constituted as a trustee in respect of
that account and the Dividend or other distribution shall remain as a debt due
to the Member. Any Dividend or other distribution which remains unclaimed
after a period of six years from the date on which such Dividend or other
distribution becomes payable shall be forfeited and shall revert to the
Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

27

 



    



   | 42| Capitalisation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Directors may at any time capitalise any sum standing to the credit of
any of the Company\'s reserve accounts or funds (including the share premium
account and capital redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to the
credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available
for distribution; appropriate such sum to Members in the proportions in which
such sum would have been divisible amongst such Members had the same been a
distribution of profits by way of Dividend or other distribution; and apply
such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment
and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the
proportion aforesaid. In such event the Directors shall do all acts and
things required to give effect to such capitalisation, with full power
given to the Directors to make such provisions as they think fit in the case
of Shares becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby
the benefit of fractional entitlements accrue to the Company rather than to
the Members concerned). The Directors may authorise any person to enter on
behalf of all of the Members interested into an agreement with the Company
providing for such capitalisation and matters incidental or relating thereto
and any agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on
all such Members and the Company.

  



   | 43| Books of Account 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 43.1| The Directors shall cause proper books of account to be kept
with respect to all sums of money received and expended by the Company and

fraud, wilful neglect or wilful default. No Indemnified Person shall be

Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final
adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification
with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such party shall not
be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses and any

enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Amendment so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as

delivered (including by facsimile transmission or by electronic transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of New York applicable to contracts wholly performed
within the borders of such state, without giving effect to the conflict of

the Exchanging Shareholder's Parent Class F Shares shall automatically be
surrendered to Parent for no consideration, and the Exchanging Shareholder
shall cease to be a holder of the portion of such shares of Parent Class F
Shares being automatically surrendered and shall have no further rights
whatsoever with respect to such securities.

 | 6| 
---|---|---

condition precedent to the exercise of its rights under this Agreement;

  



  

(d) any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of
Parent or the Company or any defense which Parent or the Company may have by
reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body
resulting from any such proceeding; and

  



  

(e) any other act or omission that may or might otherwise operate as
a discharge of Parent as a matter of law or equity, other than
the performance of the Obligation and this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Continuing Agreement_. This Agreement shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional, subject to the
compliance by the parties with the requirements and procedures set forth
herein, agreement to issue Reciprocal Ordinary Shares (or other property as
provided herein) and a guarantee of performance of the Obligation and shall
not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by Exchanging Shareholders
at any time of any right or remedy against Parent or the Company.
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until it is terminated
in accordance with _Section 7.1_.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Reservation of Shares_. The Company shall take note
that, at all times while shares of Class F Common Stock are outstanding or
are issuable (whether such obligation is absolute or contingent) pursuant to
this Agreement and/or the Memorandum and Articles, reserve and keep
available, from its authorized and unissued share capital, sufficient
Ordinary Shares solely for issuance and delivery as and when required under
this Agreement and/or such other agreements.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Dilutive Actions; Dividends; Issuances; Shareholder
Rights; Fundamental Transactions_.

  



  

(a) If there is: (1) any division or subdivision (by split,
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or
otherwise) or combination or consolidation (by reverse split,
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of the
shares of Class F Common Stock, Parent shall cause it to be accompanied by an
identical proportionate division, subdivision, consolidation or combination
of the Ordinary Shares; or (2) any division or subdivision (by split,
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or
otherwise) or combination or consolidation (by reverse split,
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of the
Ordinary Shares, Parent and the Company shall cause it to be accompanied by an
identical proportionate division, subdivision, consolidation or combination
of the shares of Class F Common Stock.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  



  

(b) In the event that Parent shall cause a dividend or other
distribution to be made on the Ordinary Shares (whether in the form of
cash, securities, properties or other assets), Parent shall take all
necessary actions (including making contributions of cash,
securities, property or other assets) so as to allow the Company to declare
and pay, and the Company shall declare and pay (and Parent shall cause the
Company to declare and pay) a dividend or distribution on each share of Class
F Common Stock which shall be identical to the dividend or distribution paid
on each Ordinary Share, at the same time as such dividend or distribution
shall be paid on the Ordinary Shares.

  



  

(c) In the event of any merger, acquisition, reorganization,
consolidation, or liquidation of Parent involving a payment or
distribution of cash, securities or other assets to the holders of Ordinary
Shares or any reclassification or other similar transaction as a result of
which the Ordinary Shares are converted into, among other things, another
security and the shares of Class F Common Stock shall remain outstanding (a
"Fundamental Transaction"), then the exchange provisions of this
Agreement shall thereafter permit the exchange of shares of Class F Common
Stock for the amount of such cash, securities or other assets which an
Exchanging Shareholder would have received had he, she or it made an exchange
for Ordinary Shares immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction,
regardless of whether such exchange would actually have been permitted at such
time and taking into account any adjustment as a result of any division or
subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination or
consolidation (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after
the effective time of such merger, acquisition,
consolidation, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other
similar transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the Ordinary Shares are converted or changed into
another security, securities or other property, this Agreement shall continue
to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to such security, securities
or other property.

  



  

(d) Parent shall provide all Exchanging Shareholders with notice of
any transaction referred to in clause (a) and (c) of this _Section 4.5_
 promptly after the Company provides notice of any such proposed transaction,
or otherwise proposes such transaction, to its shareholders but in no event
later than (i) ten (10) Business Days prior to record date of such
transaction, if applicable, or (ii) twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
applicable effective date or expiration date of such transaction, or (iii) in
any such case, such earlier time as notice thereof shall be required to be
given pursuant to Rule 10b-17 under the Exchange Act. Such notice shall
specify all material terms of such transaction, the record date (if
applicable), the proposed date of consummation of such transaction (the
"Proposed Consummation Date") and the effect of such transaction on the
Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(e) All holders of shares of Class F Common Stock shall receive all
notices, proxies, reports and other documents delivered to holders of
Ordinary Shares as if such holders of shares of Class F Common Stock were
holders of Ordinary Shares. All holders of shares of Class F Common Stock
shall be entitled to attend all meetings, whether annual or extraordinary, of
the shareholders of Parent as if such holders of Class F Common Stock were
holders of Ordinary Shares and receive such prior notice of such meetings at
substantially the same time as holders of Ordinary Shares.

Section 4.6 _Government Authority Approval_. Parent and the

whether any action in respect of (including any filing with), or consent,
approval, registration or qualification (other than registration under the
Securities Act) or waiver by, any governmental authority under any
United States federal or state law (a "Governmental Authority") is required
in connection with the issuance of Reciprocal Ordinary Shares upon an
exchange pursuant to _Article II_ hereof, (b) using their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take any such actions (including making

applicable laws of any State or other jurisdiction governing the offer and
sale of securities or (c) in a transaction that does not require registration
under the Securities Act or the laws of any applicable State or other

Exchanging Shareholder has furnished to Parent, with a copy to the Company, a
customary opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Company, prior to such sale or Transfer to the extent reasonably requested by
the Company. Each Exchanging Shareholder consents to the Parent and
Company making a notation on its records and giving instructions to any
registrar and transfer agent not to record any Transfer of securities of
Parent and the Company held by such Exchanging Shareholder without first being
notified by the Company that it is reasonably satisfied that such Transfer is
exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The Company shall promptly notify the Transfer Agent upon
reasonably determining that a proposed Transfer is exempt from, or not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Register of Members and Notation_

  



  

(a) _Ordinary Shares_. Each of the Parent, the Company and the
Exchanging Shareholders acknowledge and agree that all Reciprocal
Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be issued and
registered in the Parents register of members. In connection with the
issuance of Reciprocal Ordinary Shares, the Parent, the Company and the
Exchanging Shareholders acknowledge the following notation (or a similar
notation) may be placed in the Parent's register of members:

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

"THE RECIPROCAL ORDINARY SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN
EXEMPTION THEREFROM PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW. ANY OFFER, SALE, ASSIGNMENT,
TRANSFER OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THIS SECURITY IN A TRANSACTION THAT IS NOT
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IS SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO
REQUIRE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER
INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY."

  



  

If such notation has been placed in the Parent's register of members, the
Parent shall, at the request of an Exchanging Shareholder, remove or caused to
be removed from such register the notation described in this _Section 6.1(a)_
, if it is reasonably satisfied (based upon opinion of counsel addressed to
Parent reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, or in the case of
an Exchanging Shareholder proposing to transfer such securities, pursuant to
Rule 144(b)(1) of the Securities Act, a customary certificate addressed to
Parent confirming compliance with such exemptions, reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company) that such notation is no longer required under
applicable requirements of the Securities Act.

  



  

(b) _Book Entry Transfer_. The Parent shall register all issuances
and transfers of Reciprocal Ordinary Shares made in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, in its register of members.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Supplemental Listing_. If any shares of the Ordinary
Shares are listed on any national stock exchange, Parent shall take all such
actions as may be necessary to ensure that the shares of Reciprocal Ordinary
Shares issuable hereunder shall be duly approved for listing subject to
official notice of issuance on each securities exchange, if any, on which the
Ordinary Shares is then listed. Parent shall take all such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that all such Reciprocal Ordinary Shares may be so issued
without violation of any requirements of any domestic stock exchange upon
which Ordinary Shares may be listed (except for official notice of issuance
which shall be immediately delivered by the Parent upon each such issuance).

thereafter existing. Any waiver given by any party of any right, power or
remedy in any one instance shall only be effective in that specific instance,
and only by the party expressly giving such waiver, and only for the purpose

no effect on the rights of the Exchanging Shareholders hereunder. Any
Exchanging Shareholder shall be entitled to assign any or all of his, her or
its rights hereunder in conjunction with the assignment or transfer of his,
her or its Class F Common Stock or the right to receive Ordinary Shares to a

required as a condition to any such assignment or transfer, to become a party
to this Agreement as an Exchanging Shareholder by executing a Joinder
Agreement and Parent and the Company shall counter sign and deliver to such
Permitted Transferee an executed Joinder Agreement promptly following receipt
of a validly executed Joinder Agreement from such Permitted
Transferee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 7.7_ , if a holder of shares of Class F Common Stock shall have
entered into a lock-up or similar agreement or an arrangement with the Company

then such agreement or arrangement shall also apply to the holder with respect
to it shares of Class F Common Stock _mutatis_ _mutandis_.

Section 7.8 _Specific Performance: Remedies_. Each party
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably
and would not have an adequate remedy at law if any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which he,
she or it may be entitled at law or in equity, each party will be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
any of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and its provisions, without bond or other security being required.
Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and remedies created by this
Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
otherwise available at law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein,
nothing herein will be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of the
right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed
according to and governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard
to principles of conflict of laws.

will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from such court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any such action in any court other than a New York federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, or, if (and only if) such
court finds it lacks jurisdiction, any New York state court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, and appellate courts thereof.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Agreement and the documents or instruments referred to herein and therein,
including any exhibits and schedules attached hereto and thereto, embody the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the
subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions,
promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than
those expressly set forth or referred to herein. This Agreement and such
other agreements supersede all prior agreements and the understandings among
the parties with respect to such subject matter.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
