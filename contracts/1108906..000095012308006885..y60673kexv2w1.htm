 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :  

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Sub and Parent has approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares, Remaining Shares or Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $15.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Guarantor (as defined herein) is entering into a guarantee (the " _Guarantee_ ") in favor of the Company with respect to certain of Parents obligations under this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto (intending to be legally bound) hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I  

  

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.01  _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. 

   

 Section 1.02  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 

   ##### 

  

   

Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall no longer be
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived on such third
Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first Business Day
on which all such conditions shall again have been satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waived unless another time is agreed to
in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

   

 Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make or cause to be made all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing, and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the DGCL. 

   

 Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Greenfield Online, Inc. and the provision in the certificate of incorporation of Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted, and, as so amended, shall be the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of the Company, as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except the references to Subs name shall be replaced by references to Greenfield Online, Inc.) and, as so amended and restated, shall be the Surviving Corporations bylaws until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Sub_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 Section 1.07 _Reservation of Right to Revise Transaction_. If each of Parent and the Company agree in writing, they may change the method of effecting the business combination between the Company and Parent, and each party shall cooperate in such efforts, including to provide for a different form of Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount and kind of consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock, (b) adversely affect the proposed accounting or tax treatment of the Merger to 

   ##### 

  

   

the Company, Parent or their respective stockholders and (c) materially delay
receipt of any approval referred to in this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. 

   

 Section 1.08 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either Sub or the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of Sub and the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Sub or the Company, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Sub or the Company and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE II  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE  

  

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall with the Remaining Shares (each of which, if any, shall be converted into and become such number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation as shall be necessary to maintain relative ownership percentages) constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Sub, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Parent or Sub_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or that is held in treasury by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(j), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Remaining Shares_ ") and (ii) any Cancelled Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.02(j), all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, (ii) the Company declares or pays any cash dividend or (iii) the Company declares or pays any non-cash dividends or distributions, then in any such case the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such action; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 2.01(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. The right of any holder of a share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law. 

  

 Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit (from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(c). All cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of book-entry shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, upon surrender to the Paying 

   ##### 

  

    

Agent of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c),
and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02(b) may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer)
and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate
and each Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing Dissenting Shares, Cancelled Shares and Remaining Shares)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No payment of Merger Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, in each case, until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Following the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, or to the record holder of the Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable in respect therefor in accordance with this Article II. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (e) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the entering into of an indemnity or the posting of a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II. 

  

 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (j) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has properly perfected dissenters rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with the provisions and pursuant to the procedures of, Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any Dissenting Stockholder, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws such 

   ##### 

  

    

holders demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any
Dissenting Stockholder fails to establish such holders entitlement to
dissenters rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any Dissenting
Stockholder takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is
that such holder is not entitled to payment under Section 262 of the DGCL for
such holders shares, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (without interest) payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous
sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in (and the Company shall provide Parent
the opportunity to participate in) all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with
respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting
Shares without the prior written consent of Parent. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Stock Options_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not such Company Stock Option is then exercisable) shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the per-share Merger Consideration exceeds the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option which shall not theretofore have been exercised (the " _Option Settlement Amount_ " and for all the Company Stock Options, the " _Aggregate Option Settlement Amount_ "), without interest, and less all required tax withholdings. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of the Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 2.03(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, but in any event within five Business Days thereafter. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(d). 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " _Company Stock Option_ " means any option or right to purchase Company Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan and 611,800 options granted to Albert Angrisani, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, outside of the Company Stock Plans (the " _CEO Option_ "); and (ii) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Companys Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option Plan, the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the Companys 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Following the date of this Agreement, participants in the ESPP may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of this Agreement.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) (I) the filing of
a premerger notification and report form by Parent under the HSR Act and the
termination of the waiting period required thereunder, and (II) any required
non-U.S. antitrust or competition law approvals or filings, (2) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other
states in which Parent or Sub is qualified to do business, and (3) such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, actions, registrations,
declarations, notices and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made
would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (c) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. Parent beneficially owns each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub. 

  

 (d) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion in filings (other than the Proxy Statement) with the SEC or any Governmental Entity with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws will be true and correct in all material respects. 

  

 (e) _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy, as of the date of this Agreement, of an executed commitment letter to provide equity financing to Parent in an aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and the aggregate amount of equity financing, the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (ii) executed debt commitment letters (the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain lenders have committed to provide Parent or the Surviving Corporation with funds in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which shall be used to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement, each of the Financing Commitments, in the form delivered to the
Company, (i) has not been amended or modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect, and (ii) is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto. The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing
available to Parent and do not contain exclusivity or other provisions
that limit or otherwise restrict the lenders from providing financing to
third parties. As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01,
neither Parent nor Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it
contained in the Financing Commitment. Parent or Sub has fully paid any and
all commitment fees that have been incurred and are due and payable in
connection with the Financing Commitment prior to the date of this Agreement.
Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Section 3.01(c), the proceeds from the Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitments and together with available funds
at the Company, are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and
Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Company Stock
Options and to pay all related fees and expenses.

 (g) _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, arbitration, claim or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any demand, letter or Order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (h) _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01 of this Agreement (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" qualification or exception) and (c) the estimates, projections and forecasts contained in the Companys 2008 budget provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 3.02(h), the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to the Surviving Corporation means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with the 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of
debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (b) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as
of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent following
such date; and (c) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. 

  

 (i) _Interested Stockholder_. Prior to the Board of Directors of the Company approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL, none of Parent, Sub or their respective Affiliates was at any time an "interested stockholder" (as defined in section 203 of the DGCL) with respect to the Company. 

  

 (j) _Absences of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent, Sub or the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or Board of Directors, on the other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time. 

  

 (k) _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has caused the Guarantor to deliver to the Company a duly executed Guarantee in form and substance acceptable to the Company. 

  

 (l) _Investigation by Parent and Sub_. Each of Parent and Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Sub has been provided access to the properties, premises and records (including via an electronic data room) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Sub has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and each of Parent and Sub acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in Section 3.01, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Parent or Sub or any of their Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives or any other person has made a representation or warranty to Parent or Sub with respect to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) any material, documents or information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries made available to each of Parent or Sub or their Representatives in the electronic data room or otherwise or (c) in connection with any materials prepared for or in connection with the Parents arrangement of the Financing or the Financing Commitment, except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.01.

 (ii) prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

  

 In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Sub and to comply with the requirements of this Section 4.02(f) with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two calendar days. 

  

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the Company, in circumstances not involving a Takeover Proposal, from amending, modifying or withdrawing the Board of Directors recommendation to the extent that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary under applicable Law in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall give Parent written notice of any such action taken by the Board of Directors not later than the Business Day next succeeding the day on which such action is taken, setting forth in reasonable detail the action taken and the basis therefor.

 Section 5.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) that the conditions set forth in 

   ##### 

  

    

Article VI are satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, and approvals from Governmental
Entities and non-governmental third parties and the making of all necessary
registrations, notices and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities) and (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (A) file as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 10 Business Days) with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the notification and report form
(the " _HSR Filing_ ") required under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) make, as
promptly as practicable, all notifications and other filings required (1)
under any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition laws (together with
the HSR Filings, the " _Antitrust Filings_ ") and (2) under any other
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law that the
Company and Parent deem advisable or appropriate, in each case, with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and as promptly as
practicable. The Antitrust Filings shall be in substantial compliance with
the requirements of the Laws, as applicable. Subject to first having used all
reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution of any objections underlying
such lawsuits or other legal proceedings, Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to defend and contest any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order,
or preliminary injunction entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed. 

  

 (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.03, subject to applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that material may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (y) as necessary to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns. Neither party shall file any such document or take such action if the other party has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be expected to either (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause a condition set forth in Article VI to not be satisfied in a timely manner. Neither party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party. 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company or Parent (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity that is related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties agree
not to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it so
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. Each party will advise the other party promptly of
any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the
first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each party will use all reasonable efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws,
including (subject to first having used all reasonable efforts to negotiate a
resolution to any such objections) contesting and resisting any action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation, decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including, without limitation, Section 5.03), no party is required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company, Parent, or any of their Affiliates in any manner which, individually or in the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements and Orders could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will, upon the request of Parent, become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. Furthermore, without the prior written consent of the Parent (determined in its sole discretion), in no event shall the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates: (i) pay any consideration to, amend or enter into any agreement with, any non-governmental third party to obtain any consent to the Merger or to otherwise comply with Section 5.03(e); or (ii) agree to the imposition of limitations on the ability of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent to hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, including the right to 

   ##### 

  

    

vote such shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Parent acknowledges that the Surviving Corporation shall by operation of law assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, the Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors, officers, employees or agents and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement), without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.04 for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time. In the event (A) the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of its assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, or (B) Parent takes any action to materially impair the financial ability of the Surviving Corporation to satisfy the obligations referred to in Section 5.04(a), Parent will either guarantee such obligations or take such other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving Corporation, legal and financial, to satisfy such obligations will not be diminished in any material respect. 

  

 (c) Commencing at or prior to the Effective Time and until six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts comparable to the insurance maintained 

   ##### 

  

    

currently by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous
to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with carriers having an A.M.
Best "key rating" of A X or better, _provided_ that such substitution shall
not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, and  _provided, further,_ that the
Surviving Corporation shall first use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from such carriers a so-called "tail" policy providing such coverage and being
effective for the full six year period referred to above, and shall be
entitled to obtain such coverage in annual policies from such carriers only
if it is unable, after exerting such efforts for a reasonable period of time,
to obtain such a "tail" policy; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement as set forth in Section 5.04(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (or, in the case of a "tail" policy obtained pursuant to
the preceding proviso, shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium
therefor in excess of an amount equal to six times 300% of such last annual
premium) and, if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance
required by this Section 5.04(c), it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium (or an aggregate
premium, as the case may be) equal to such maximum amount; and _provided,
further_ that Parent shall not acquire the insurance required by this Section
5.04(c) at or prior to the Effective Time without the Companys prior consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.04: (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. It is expressly agreed that the indemnified parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.04. 

  

 Section 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.05, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

 (b) In the event that 

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(f); or 

   

 (ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known, disclosed or proposed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(ii) or by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and (C) within nine (9) months after such 

   ##### 

  

    

termination, the Company enters into, or submits to the stockholders of the
Company for adoption, a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, or consummates the transactions contemplated by any Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 5.05(b)(ii), all
references to 15% in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be 50%) which in each case, need not be the same Takeover Proposal that shall
have been publicly announced or made known at or prior to termination of this
Agreement; 

 

then (in the case of the occurrence of any one or more of Sections 5.05(b)(i)
and 5.05(b)(ii)) the Company shall pay Parent a one-time Company Termination
Fee (less any Expenses that may previously have been paid or are payable in
the circumstances as provided below) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the first Business Day following (x) in the case of a
payment required by Section 5.05(b)(i), the date of termination of this
Agreement, and (y) in the case of a payment required by Section 5.05(b)(ii),
the date of the consummation of such Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal
to $10,000,000; _provided_ , if the Company Termination Fee becomes payable
by the Company in connection with a termination under Section 7.01(e) in
order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover
Proposal with an Excluded Party, then the Company Termination Fee shall
be $5,000,000. 

   

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section of 7.01 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii)) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section 7.01 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 7.01(c)), then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the sum of Parents Expenses (not to exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate) for which Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds, such payment to be made following such termination within two Business Days following delivery to the Company of notice of demand for such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Expenses_ " means, with respect to a party hereto, all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and expenses of debt financing sources (including those who are parties to any financing commitments), counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the sale process, including the authorization, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (i) Section 7.01(d) or (ii) Section 7.01(b)(i); and, at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and Sections 6.02(a), (b), (c) and (d) have been satisfied; and, in the case of termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i), the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and Sections 6.02(a), (b), (c) and (d) have been satisfied for at least one Business Day prior to such termination, then the Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $12,500,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than two Business Days after such termination by the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 5.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if any party fails to pay when due the amount payable pursuant to this Section 5.05, and, in order to obtain such payment, the owed party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the owing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 5.05, the owing party shall pay to the owed party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the terms set forth in this Section 5.05, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of receipt by the owed party of immediately available funds in such amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such termination fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 5.05 or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Sub, the Guarantor and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Sub, the Guarantor or any of their former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to the announcement of any Change in Recommendation (or proposed Change in Recommendation) made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the express terms of Section 4.02 of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

   

 Section 5.07 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation against the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or their respective directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.08 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) Parent agrees to, and to cause the Company to, honor all Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms of such plans and applicable law. For a period of two years following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation and its affiliates to provide (i) to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base wages, and annual cash or other incentive compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than such annual base salary and base wages, and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to Company Employees benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) generally provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be permitted to make market rate adjustments to welfare plan employee premium and copay arrangements. 

  

 (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Surviving Corporation and its affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be receive credit for his or her years of service with the Company and its affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities), to the same extent that such Company Employee received credit for such service before the Effective Time (except (i) for credit for benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan and (ii) to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible: (i) each Company Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents unless such conditions and requirements would not have been waived under the comparable Benefit Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the date such employees participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section 5.08 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any 

   ##### 

  

    

other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose. 

  

 Section 5.09 _Financing_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and (iii) to satisfy all agreements and conditions applicable to it in such definitive agreements and consummate the Financing no later than November 30, 2008.

In the event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than, in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied, Parent shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date.

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the Company and its Subsidiaries shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) using its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered such officers or other certificates as are customary in financings of such type (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters) and as are, in the good faith determination of the persons executing such

instruments, or agreeing to enter into agreements, in connection with the
foregoing); _provided_ , that no obligation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under any such agreement, pledge, guarantee or grant contemplated
by this clause (ii) shall be effective until the Effective Time, (iii) using
its reasonable best efforts to cause its independent registered public
accountants to deliver such comfort letters as are customary in financings of

Outside Date) with financial and other pertinent information (including
quarterly financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared
in the ordinary course of business) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all financial statements and
other financial data required by the Debt Commitment Letters, (v) making the
Companys or Subsidiaries executive officers and other relevant employees
reasonably available to assist the lenders providing the Financing, including
customary and reasonable participation in road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, assisting Parent and such lenders
in developing financial projections and pro forma financial statements, and
otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection with the consummation of the
Financing, (vi) permitting the lenders providing the Financing to conduct
field audits and facility visits as part of their evaluation of the Companys
assets, cash management and accounting systems and their policies and
procedures relating thereto and otherwise taking all actions reasonably
necessary to permit the lenders to make such evaluations, (vii) assisting
Parent and Sub with their preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing (including the execution and delivery of one or
more customary representation letters in connection therewith), (viii)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Financing,
including providing assistance in the preparation for and participating in,
meetings, due diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with, among
others, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies; (ix) providing
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company
customarily prepares such financial statements and (x) taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, to permit consummation of
the Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all proceeds of the
Debt Financing by the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time _._ Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.09.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation or authorize any of
corporate action in connection with the Financing (or any replacements
thereof) prior to the Effective Time. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Sub or
their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.09 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except to the
extent otherwise consented to by the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its

Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that, (i) prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) at all times, its other Affiliates and its Representatives shall have no responsibility for any financing that Parent or Sub may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the monetary damages set forth in Section 5.05(d). Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any federal court within the District of Delaware in the event any

dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any federal
court within the District of Delaware. Any judgment from any such court
described above may, however, be enforced by any party in any other court in
any other jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of
process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in
this Section 8.10 in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 8.02 of this
Agreement. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to
effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available
method. 

   

 Section 8.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   

 Section 8.12 _No Recourse_. Subject to Section 8.07, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto, or against the Guarantor under and to the extent set forth in the Guarantee, and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto (other than the Guarantor (to the extent set forth in the Guarantee)) shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
