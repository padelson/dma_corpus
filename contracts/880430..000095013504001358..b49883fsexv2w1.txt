                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of March 17, 2004, by and among FISHER SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Fisher"), FOX MERGER CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation
and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Fisher ("Merger Sub"), and APOGENT
TECHNOLOGIES INC., a Wisconsin corporation ("Apogent").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

      WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Fisher, Merger Sub and
Apogent have deemed it advisable and fair to and in the best interests of their
respective corporations and stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, that
Fisher and Apogent engage in a business combination in order to advance their
respective long-term strategic business interests; and

      WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Fisher, Merger Sub and Apogent have approved this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Apogent with Apogent continuing as the surviving
corporation (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"); and

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Apogent has approved and has determined
to recommend to its shareholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger; and

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Fisher has approved, and has determined
to recommend to its stockholders approval of, the issuance of shares of Fisher
Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) in connection with the Merger (the
"Stock Issuance"); and

      WHEREAS, Fisher, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement and the Merger; and

      WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this
Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:


                                       1
<PAGE>
                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

      SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the WBCL, at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Apogent,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Apogent shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub in accordance with the WBCL.

      SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than delivery of
items to be delivered at the Closing and other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the
occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York
10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the
"Closing Date."

      SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
WBCL (the "Articles of Merger") with the Department of Financial Institutions of
the State of Wisconsin (the "DFI") and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the WBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the DFI, or at such
subsequent date or time as Fisher and Apogent shall agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger, which date shall be not more than 90 days after the date the
Articles of Merger are received for filing. The time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

      SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of
the WBCL.

      SECTION 1.5 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the Apogent Charter (as defined in Section 3.1(a)(ii)) shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and as set forth in Exhibit A, and shall thereafter be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with
Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.1(g)(ii)) and as provided in such
articles of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time,
Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation is Apogent Technologies Inc." At the Effective Time,


                                       2
<PAGE>
the Apogent Bylaws (as defined in Section 3.1(a)(ii)) shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with Applicable Laws and as provided in such bylaws.

      SECTION 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
Applicable Laws. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers
of Apogent immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and Applicable Laws.

      SECTION 1.7 Alternative Structure. Apogent and Fisher may mutually agree
in writing to cause the "Merger" to be a merger of Apogent with and into Merger
Sub at the Effective Time, in which case, following the "Merger," the separate
corporate existence of Apogent will cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation, at any time prior to receipt of both Apogent Shareholder
Approval (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(iii)) and Fisher Stockholder Approval, or
at any time thereafter if, with appropriate disclosure, any required further
approval of the revised structure is obtained from the shareholders of Apogent
and the stockholders of Fisher, as applicable; provided, however, that (a) any
such change to the structure of the Merger would not affect the qualification of
the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
(b) any such change to the structure of the Merger would not affect the proposed
accounting treatment for the Merger or the tax treatment to Fisher, Apogent or
their stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or otherwise prejudice
Fisher, Apogent or their stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or, with
respect to Section 5.5, materially prejudice any third party beneficiary
thereof, (c) any such change to the structure of the Merger would not delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
in any respect and (d) any such change to the structure of the Merger would not
in any way affect the corporate governance structure of Fisher, Apogent or the
Surviving Corporation. Apogent and Fisher agree to consider in good faith the
request of the other party to revise the structure of the Merger from that set
forth herein and, upon mutual written agreement to revise the structure of the
Merger, shall, subject to the foregoing, take any action necessary to permit the
provisions of this Article I to be effective and shall make such other changes
that are necessary to be made to reflect the change in structure that has been
agreed.

                                   ARTICLE II

                 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

      SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Fisher, Merger Sub, Apogent or the holders of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Apogent, "Apogent Common
Stock"):


                                       3
<PAGE>
            (a) Conversion of Apogent Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.1(e)
and 2.1(f), each share of Apogent Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Apogent Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive .56 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Fisher Common
Stock"), of Fisher (the "Merger Consideration"). As a result of the Merger, at
the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b))
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Apogent Common
Stock represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be
issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(i)).

            (b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

            (c) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each share of Apogent Common
Stock held in the treasury of Apogent, if any, shall automatically be
extinguished without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in
respect thereof or any shares of Apogent Common Stock owned, beneficially or of
record, by any Subsidiary of Apogent.

            (d) Apogent Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the
Effective Time, (i) all options to purchase Apogent Common Stock (each, an
"Apogent Option") and all Apogent Restricted Stock Units (as defined in Section
5.11(a)(ii)) issued and outstanding under each Apogent Stock Plan (as defined in
Section 3.1(b)(i)) shall vest (to the extent presently unvested) and, in the
case of Apogent Restricted Stock Units, become nonforfeitable and, in the case
of Apogent Options, become exercisable and be assumed by Fisher in accordance
with Section 5.11(a) and (ii) all rights outstanding under Apogent's Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "Apogent Purchase Plan"), shall be treated as set forth
in Section 5.11(b).

            (e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Fisher Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Apogent Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of Fisher Common Stock (after aggregating all shares of Fisher Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of
such holder's Certificate or Certificates, receive from Fisher an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of:
(i) the fractional share interest (after aggregating all shares of Fisher Common
Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder) which such holder would
otherwise receive, multiplied by (ii) the closing price of one share of Fisher
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape
ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time.


                                       4
<PAGE>
            (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any
stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Fisher Common Stock or
Apogent Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to Fisher Common Stock or Apogent Common Stock
having a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

      SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Shares and Certificates.

            (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Fisher shall
engage an institution reasonably satisfactory to Apogent to act as exchange
agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an
agreement reasonably satisfactory to Apogent. At the Effective Time, Fisher
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Apogent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
certificates representing the shares of Fisher Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a). In addition, Fisher shall make available by depositing with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in
an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares
of Apogent Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash and
certificates representing shares of Fisher Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

            (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in
any event within 10 business days after the Effective Time, Fisher shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Apogent Common Stock (the "Certificates"), which at the
Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Fisher
and Apogent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Fisher
Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e)
and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Fisher Common Stock (after taking into account
all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless
a physical certificate is requested), payment by cash or check in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Apogent Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Apogent, a certificate


                                       5
<PAGE>
representing the proper number of shares of Fisher Common Stock may be issued to
a Person (as defined in Section 8.3(n)) other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Fisher Common Stock to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Fisher
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section
2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c).

            (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to shares of Fisher Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Fisher Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e) hereof, until such
Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such
surrender, the number of whole shares of Fisher Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Fisher Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Fisher Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Fisher Common Stock.

            (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Apogent Common Stock. All shares
of Fisher Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid)
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Apogent Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates. After the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of Apogent shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Apogent Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

            (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Fisher, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Fisher for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fisher Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c).

            (f) No Liability. None of Fisher, Merger Sub, Apogent or the
Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Fisher Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Fisher Common Stock, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Fisher Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Fisher Common Stock issuable in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(v)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

            (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Fisher on a daily basis,
provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former shareholders of Apogent after the Effective Time pursuant to
this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to Fisher.

            (h) Withholding Rights. Fisher and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Apogent Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Fisher or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Fisher or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been
paid.

            (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Fisher
Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash for fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that Fisher may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Fisher, or a bond in such sum
as Fisher may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against Fisher or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of Apogent. Except as set forth
in (x) the disclosure schedule dated as of the date of this Agreement and
executed and delivered by Apogent to Fisher concurrently with or prior to the
execution and delivery by Apogent of this Agreement (the "Apogent Disclosure
Schedule") and (y) the Apogent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (as
defined in Section 3.1(d)(i)) , Apogent represents and warrants to Fisher and
Merger Sub as set forth in this Article III. Each disclosure set forth in the
Apogent Disclosure Schedule, and any other information included in the Apogent
Disclosure Schedule, is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under a
heading referring to, a specific individual subsection of this Agreement and
shall be deemed to be disclosed solely for purposes of, and shall qualify and be
treated as an exception to, such subsection, except to the extent that
disclosure in one subsection of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule is specifically
referred to in another subsection of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule by
appropriate cross-reference and except to the extent that the relevance of a
disclosure in one subsection of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule to another
subsection of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent. The
parties hereby agree that no reference to or disclosure of any item or other
matter in the Apogent Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or
indication that (1) such item or other matter is material, (2) such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Apogent
Disclosure Schedule or (3) any breach or violation of Applicable Laws or any
Contract (as defined in Section 8.3(d)) exists or has actually occurred.

            (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries.

                  (i) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Apogent and
each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.3(o)) is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or otherwise organized and has the
requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority and all necessary
government approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as currently conducted, except for those jurisdictions in which the
failure to have such power, authority or government approvals and to be so
organized, existing or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 8.3(k)) on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of
Apogent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature or conduct of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

only vote of the holders of any class or series of Apogent capital stock
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (iv) No Conflict. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c)(iv) of
the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Apogent do not, and the consummation by Apogent of the transactions contemplated

            failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or in the

            (d)   SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

                  (i) Apogent has filed with the SEC all registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements, certifications
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
by reference therein) presently required to be so filed by Apogent since October
1, 2002 (excluding the Joint Proxy Statement, the "Apogent SEC Documents"). As
of their respective dates, the Apogent SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, to the extent in
effect, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Apogent SEC Documents, and
none of the Apogent SEC Documents, when filed, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
corrected by a subsequently filed Apogent SEC Document filed with the SEC prior
to the date hereof. No Subsidiary of Apogent is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

                  (ii) Each of the principal executive officer of Apogent and
the principal financial officer of Apogent (or each former principal executive
officer of Apogent and each former principal financial officer of Apogent, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under
the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Apogent SEC Documents. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither
Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

                  (iii) The financial statements of Apogent included in the
Apogent SEC Documents, including each Apogent SEC Document filed after the date
hereof until the Effective Time, comply, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Form 10-Q or 8-K or other applicable rules of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Apogent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which
are not material). The financial books and records of Apogent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are true and correct in all material respects.

                  (iv)  Except as reflected or reserved against in the balance
      sheet of Apogent, dated December 31, 2003, included in the Form 10-Q filed
      by Apogent with the SEC on February 13, 2004 (including the notes thereto,
      the "Apogent Balance Sheet") and except as set forth in Section 3.1(d)(iv)
      of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, neither Apogent nor any of its
      Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
      absolute, accrued, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise) nor, to the
      Knowledge (as defined in Section 8.3(j)) of Apogent, does any basis exist
      therefor, other than (A) liabilities or obligations incurred since
      December 31, 2003 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
      practice which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) liabilities
      or obligations under the Apogent Material Contracts set forth in Section
      3.1(q)(ii) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, (C) liabilities or
      obligations incurred pursuant to Contracts entered into after the date
      hereof not in violation of this Agreement and (D) liabilities or
      obligations incurred pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
      contemplated hereby.

                  (v)   Except as set forth in Section 3.1(d)(v) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
      party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
      off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
      (including without limitation any contract or arrangement relating to any
      transaction or relationship between or among Apogent and any of its
      Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate (as
      defined in Section 8.3(a)), including without limitation any structured
      finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
      hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
      Regulation S)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
      contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
      involving, or material liabilities of, Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries
      in Apogent's or such Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
      Apogent SEC Documents.

                  (vi)  No "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
      601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) filed as an exhibit to the
      Apogent Form 10-K has been amended or modified, except for amendments or
      modifications which have been filed as an exhibit to a subsequently dated
      Apogent SEC Document or are not required to be filed with the SEC.

            (e)   Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Apogent for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC
by Fisher in connection with the issuance of Fisher Common Stock in the Merger

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to Apogent's
shareholders or at the time of the

                                       15
<PAGE>
Apogent Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(e), no
representation or warranty is made by Apogent with respect to information or
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement which were not supplied by or on behalf of Apogent.

            (f)   Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

                  (i)   Except as set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, since October 1, 2003 through the date hereof, except
      as and to the extent disclosed in the Apogent SEC Documents filed prior to
      the date of this Agreement and except for liabilities incurred pursuant to
      this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby:

      (A)   Apogent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in
            the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

      (B)   there has not been any split, combination or reclassification of any
            of Apogent's capital stock or any declaration, setting aside or
            payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash,
            stock or property) in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for,
            shares of Apogent's capital stock;

      (C)   except as required by a change in GAAP, there has not been any
            change in accounting methods, principles or practices by Apogent;
            and

      (D)   there has not been any action taken by Apogent or any of its
            Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this
            Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
            Section 4.1(a), other than actions in connection with entering into
            this Agreement.

                  (ii)  Since October 1, 2003 through the date hereof, there
      have not been any changes, circumstances or events that, individually or
      in the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
      Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            (g)   Compliance with Applicable Laws; Permits; Litigation.

                  (i)   Apogent, its Subsidiaries and employees hold all
      authorizations, permits, licenses, certificates, easements, concessions,
      franchises, variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations,
      approvals and clearances of

                                       16
<PAGE>
      all Governmental Entities (including all authorizations under the Federal
      Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the "FDCA"), and the
      regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")
      promulgated thereunder) and third Persons which are required for Apogent
      and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties and other
      assets and to carry on their respective businesses in the manner described
      in the Apogent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as they
      are being conducted as of the date hereof (the "Apogent Permits"), and all
      Apogent Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
      failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to
      be valid or in full force and effect of, any such Apogent Permits,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
      a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole.

                  (ii)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(g)(ii) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, Apogent and its Subsidiaries are, and have been at
      all times since October 1, 2002, in compliance with the terms of the
      Apogent Permits and all laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
      policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders
      entered by any Governmental Entity, including the Public Health Service
      Act, Biological Products, 21 C.F.R.Sections 600-610 (the "Public
      Health Service Act") (all such laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
      policies, directives, guidelines, judgments, decisions and orders,
      collectively, "Applicable Laws") relating to Apogent and its Subsidiaries
      or their respective businesses, assets or properties, except where the
      failure to be in compliance with the terms of the Apogent Permits or such
      Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(g)(ii)
      of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, since October 1, 2002, neither Apogent
      nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notification from any
      Governmental Entity (A) asserting that Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries
      is not in compliance with, or at any time since such date has failed to
      comply with, Applicable Laws (except for any such lack of compliance
      which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken
      as a whole) or (B) or threatening to revoke any Permit (except for any
      such revocation which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and
      its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) nor, to the Knowledge of Apogent, does
      any basis exist therefore. As of the date hereof, no material
      investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the
      Knowledge of Apogent, has been threatened in writing against Apogent or
      any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (iii) Except with respect to Section 404 of SOX, Apogent is,
      and has been, in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
      of SOX applicable to it on or prior to the date hereof and has implemented
      such programs and has taken all reasonable steps necessary to ensure
      Apogent's future compliance (not later than the relevant statutory and
      regulatory deadlines therefor)

                                       17
<PAGE>
      with all provisions of SOX which shall become applicable to Apogent after
      the date hereof.

                  (iv)  As of the date hereof, except as and to the extent
      disclosed in the Apogent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
      Agreement, including the notes to the financial statements included
      therein, no action, audit, demand, claim, suit, proceeding, requirement or
      investigation by any Governmental Entity, and no suit, action, mediation,
      arbitration or proceeding by any Person, against or affecting Apogent or
      any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, including
      Intellectual Property (as defined in Section 8.3(i)), is pending or, to
      the Knowledge of Apogent, threatened which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
      on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (v)   Neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or at
      any time since October 1, 2002 has been, subject to any outstanding order,
      injunction or decree which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
      would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent
      and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            (h)   Labor and Other Employment Matters.

                  (i)   As of the date hereof, except as would not, individually
      or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or as set forth
      in Section 3.1(h)(i) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, (A) no work

      (D) neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any payment
      to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental Entity with respect to
      unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
      obligations for employees, (E) no employee of Apogent, at the officer
      level or above, has given written notice to Apogent or any of its
      Subsidiaries that any such employee intends to terminate his or her
      employment with Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries, (F) to the Knowledge
      of Apogent, no employee of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries is in any
      respect in violation of any term of any employment contract, nondisclosure
      agreement, common law nondisclosure obligations, non-competition
      agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to
      the right of any such employee to be employed by Apogent or any of its
      Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or presently

                                       18
<PAGE>
      proposed to be conducted by Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries or to the
      use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others, (G) neither

                  (ii)  Except as set forth in Section 3.1(h)(ii) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof,

                        (A)   neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
            party to, or otherwise bound by, any collective bargaining agreement
            or any other agreement, work rules or practices with a labor union,
            labor organization or works council, nor are any such agreements,
            work rules or practices presently being negotiated;

                        (B)   none of the employees of Apogent or any of its
            Subsidiaries is represented by any labor union, labor organization

                        (C)   no labor union, labor organization or works

            has made a pending demand for recognition or certification to

            of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (i)   Benefit Plans.

                  (i)   Section 3.1(i)(i)(A) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule
      sets forth a true and complete list of each written bonus, pension, profit
      sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership,
      stock purchase, stock option or other equity compensation, phantom stock,
      stock-related or performance award, retirement, vacation, severance or
      termination pay, change in control, retention, disability, death benefit,
      hospitalization, medical, life

                                       19
<PAGE>
      insurance, loan, disability, and other similar plan, arrangement,
      agreement or understanding, including, without limitation, each "employee
      benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
      Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and any
      employment agreement, consulting agreement, termination or severance
      agreement (such plans, agreements, arrangements or understandings, except
      any plan which is a Multiemployer Plan (as defined in Section 8.3(l)),
      collectively, "Benefit Plans") with or for the benefit of any current or
      former employee, officer or director of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries
      or ERISA Affiliates (as defined in Section 3.1(i)(v)) or with respect to
      which Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates have any
      obligations or liabilities (the "Apogent Benefit Plans"). With respect to
      the Apogent Benefit Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no
      condition or set of circumstances, which would reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole, under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Laws. Neither
      Apogent, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Apogent,
      any other Person, has any express or implied commitment, whether legally
      enforceable or not, to modify, change or terminate any Apogent Benefit
      Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
      required by ERISA or the Code, or any other Applicable Laws. Except as set
      forth in Section 3.1(i)(i)(B) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, Apogent
      has delivered or made available to Fisher true, correct and complete
      copies of all Apogent Benefit Plans (or, if not so delivered, has
      delivered or made available to Fisher a written summary of their material
      terms) and, with respect thereto, all amendments, trust agreements,
      insurance Contracts, other funding vehicles, determination letters issued
      by the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent annual reports (Form 5500
      series) filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the most recent
      actuarial report or other financial statement relating to such Apogent
      Benefit Plan.

                  (ii)  Each Apogent Benefit Plan has been, in all material
      respects, administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the
      applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable Laws and
      with the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each
      Apogent Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is
      capable of approval by, or registration or qualification for special tax
      status with, the appropriate taxation, social security or supervisory
      authorities in the relevant country, state, territory or the like (each,
      an "Approval") has received such Approval (or there remains a period of
      time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any
      material amendment that has not previously received such Approval), and no
      event has occurred which would reasonably be expected to result in the
      revocation of such Approval or the imposition of material sanctions by
      such authorities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
      Apogent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
      of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter from the
      Internal Revenue Service that the Apogent Benefit Plan is so qualified and
      all related trusts are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under
      Section 501(a) of the Code, and,

                                       20
<PAGE>
      to the Knowledge of Apogent, nothing has occurred, whether by action or by
      failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification or
      exemption.

                  (iii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(iii) of the
      Apogent Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Apogent, no oral or
      written representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect
      of any Apogent Benefit Plan has been made to an employee or former
      employee of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries by an authorized Apogent
      employee that is not materially in accordance with the written or
      otherwise pre-existing terms and provisions of such Apogent Benefit Plans.
      To the Knowledge of Apogent, neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries
      has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether
      written or oral, with any trade union, works council or other employee
      representative body or any material number or category of its employees
      which would prevent, restrict or materially impede the implementation of
      any layoff, redundancy, severance or similar program within its or their
      respective workforces (or any part of them).

                  (iv)  There are no material unresolved claims or disputes
      under the terms of, or in connection with, any Apogent Benefit Plan (other
      than routine undisputed claims for benefits), and no action, legal or
      otherwise, has been commenced or threatened with respect to any material
      claim or otherwise in connection with an Apogent Benefit Plan.

                  (v)   Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(v) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each Funded Retirement Plan (as
      defined below) of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries, the aggregate value
      of the assets of such Funded Retirement Plan is equal to or greater than
      the aggregate value of its liabilities assessed on an ongoing and
      terminated basis and calculated in accordance with the actuarial methods
      and assumptions used in such valuation pursuant to such Funded Retirement
      Plan and Applicable Laws and GAAP. For purposes of this Agreement, "Funded
      Retirement Plan" means, with respect to a party, a Benefit Plan that is a
      "pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not
      such Benefit Plan is subject to ERISA) and under which the assets to
      satisfy the benefit obligations are legally segregated from the general
      assets of such party or any of its Subsidiaries and are not subject to the
      creditors of such party or any of its Subsidiaries. None of Apogent or any
      other Person or entity under common control within the meaning of Section
      414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") with Apogent
      has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any liability to a
      Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than for
      contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
      (other than for payment of premiums not yet due) that, when aggregated
      with other such liabilities, would reasonably be expected to result in a
      material liability of Apogent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
      which liability has not been fully paid.

                                       21
<PAGE>
                  (vi)  Section 3.1(i)(vi) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule
      sets forth a true and complete list of each Multiemployer Plan to which
      Apogent or any ERISA Affiliate of Apogent contributes or is required to
      contribute, or to which or with respect to which, Apogent or any ERISA
      Affiliate of Apogent has any material liability.

                  (vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(vii) of the
      Apogent Disclosure Schedule, no Apogent Benefit Plan provides health
      benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to employees or former
      employees of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries after retirement or other
      termination of service (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Laws or
      benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former
      employee).

                  (viii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(viii)(A) of the
      Apogent Disclosure Schedule, and except with respect to each unvested
      Apogent Option and Apogent Restricted Stock Unit, each of which by its
      terms will automatically vest and, in the case of an Apogent Option,
      become exercisable and, in the case of an Apogent Restricted Stock Unit,
      become nonforfeitable, upon a change of control of Apogent, neither the
      negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
      transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence
      of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any
      Apogent Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of
      severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of
      indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
      fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of Apogent
      or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(viii)(B)
      of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, agreement, plan
      or arrangement with an employee or former employee of Apogent to which
      Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this
      Agreement that, individually or collectively and as a result of the
      transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of
      any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise, would reasonably be
      expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
      deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

            (j)   Taxes.

                  (i)   Each of Apogent and its Subsidiaries has (A) duly and
      timely filed (or there have been filed on its behalf) all material Tax
      Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by it (taking into account
      all applicable extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority (as defined
      below) and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all
      material respects, (B) duly paid in full or made provision in accordance
      with GAAP (or there has been paid or provision has been made on its
      behalf) for the payment of all material Taxes (as defined in Section
      3.1(j)(xi)) for all periods ending through the date hereof and

                                       22
<PAGE>
      (C) complied in all material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to
      the payment and withholding of Taxes.

                  (ii)  There are no material Liens for Taxes upon any property

      provided in accordance with GAAP in the most recent financial statements
      contained in the Apogent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
      Agreement.

                  (iii) The most recent financial statements contained in the
      Apogent SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP
      for all Tax liabilities of Apogent and its Subsidiaries for all taxable
      periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial
      statements.

                  (iv)  Except as set forth in Section 3.1(j)(iv) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, there is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund
      litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to
      any Taxes or Tax Return of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries which, if
      determined adversely, would be expected to result in a material Tax
      deficiency. Neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
      written notice of any claim made by a Governmental Entity in a
      jurisdiction where Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does
      not file a Tax Return, that Apogent or such Subsidiary is or may be
      subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                  (v)   The material income Tax Returns of Apogent and each of
      its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors thereof, have been examined
      by the applicable Tax Authority (or the applicable statutes of limitations
      for the assessment of income Taxes for such periods have expired) for all
      periods through and including September 30, 1999, and no material
      deficiencies were asserted as a result of such examinations which have not
      been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a liability on the most recent
      financial statements contained in the Apogent SEC Documents.

                  (vi)  Except as set forth in Section 3.1(j)(vi) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding requests, agreements,
      consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations
      applicable to the assessment of any Taxes or deficiencies against Apogent
      or any of its Subsidiaries, and no power of attorney granted by either
      Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes is currently
      in force.

                  (vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(j)(vii) of the
      Apogent Disclosure Schedule, neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries
      is a party to any agreement providing for the allocation, indemnification
      or sharing of Taxes (other than any agreements solely between Apogent and
      its Subsidiaries), and neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has
      been a member of an affiliated group (or similar state, local or foreign
      filing group) filing a

                                       23
<PAGE>
      consolidated income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of
      which is Apogent) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
      (other than Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
      foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

                  (viii) Apogent and each of its Subsidiaries has delivered or
      made available to Fisher complete copies of all material income Tax
      Returns of Apogent and each of its Subsidiaries, including any
      predecessors thereof, for taxable years ending between October 1, 1999 and
      September 30, 2003, excepting such Tax Returns as have not been filed for
      the taxable year ending September 30, 2003 pursuant to appropriate
      extensions with respect thereto.

                  (ix)  Except as set forth in Section 3.1(j)(ix) of the Apogent
      Disclosure Schedule, neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A)
      agreed to make nor is it required to make any material adjustment under
      Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or
      otherwise; (B) constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
      "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of
      the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment
      under Section 355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the date of
      this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute
      part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning
      of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger; or (C) taken
      (or caused to be taken) any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan
      or other circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
      Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
      368(a) of the Code.

                  (x)   Apogent is not, and has not been, a United States real
      property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code)
      during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
      Code.

                  (xi)  "Taxes" means any and all federal, state, local, foreign

      additions to tax and additional amounts imposed with respect thereto)
      imposed by any Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, taxes
      or other charges on or with respect to income, franchises, windfall or
      other profits, gross receipts, property, sales, use, capital stock,

                        (N)   Any Contract (other than Contracts of the type

                  (ii)  Schedule. Section 3.1(q)(ii) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all Apogent Material Contracts as of the date
hereof, except for the Contracts referred to in clause (M) of the foregoing
subsection (i) as having been made available in the data room maintained by
Apogent's counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. With
respect to the Contracts described in (i) Section 3.1(q)(i)(D), (F), (I), (J),
(L) and (N) of this Agreement, Section 3.1(q)(ii) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth only Contracts which require payments, or in the case of
clause (D) involve obligations, in excess of $2,500,000 and (ii) Section
3.1(q)(i)(N) of this Agreement, Section 3.1(q)(ii) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth only Contracts involving payments to Apogent, or any
Subsidiary of Apogent, in excess of $10,000,000.

                  (iii) No Breach. All Apogent Material Contracts are valid and
in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law), except to the extent that (A) they have
previously expired in accordance with their terms or (B) the failure to be in
full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Neither Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to Apogent's
Knowledge, any counterparty to any Apogent Material Contract, has violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or

                                       29
<PAGE>
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Apogent Material Contract, except in each case for those
violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Apogent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            (r)   Real Property. Section 3.1(r)(i) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule lists all material real property owned in fee by Apogent or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Apogent Owned Real Property") or leased by Apogent or any of
its Subsidiaries as lessee (the "Apogent Leased Real Property"). Apogent or any
of its Subsidiaries owns good and valid title to the Apogent Owned Real Property
and has valid and enforceable leasehold interests under the leases with respect
to the Apogent Leased Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other than (i)
Permitted Liens (as defined in Section 8.3(m) and (ii) easements, covenants,
rights-of-way and other encumbrances or restrictions, whether recorded or
referred to in an applicable lease or unrecorded, which do not materially impair
the continued use of the property subject thereto as currently used, but in no
event, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), environmental or Tax Liens,
judgments, lis pendens or any Lien that would render the title to the Apogent
Owned Real Property uninsurable by a reputable title insurance company. All of
the improvements located on any Apogent Owned Real Property or Apogent Leased
Real Property are in good condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear)
without any structural defects of any kind. Except as set forth in Section
3.1(r)(i) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule, each material lease with respect
to the Apogent Leased Real Property is valid, unmodified and in full force and
effect, and there are no material subleases with respect to the Apogent Leased
Real Property. Neither any landlord nor Apogent nor any of its Subsidiaries
party to any material lease with respect to the Apogent Leased Real Property is
in monetary or other material default under any such lease.

            (s)   Apogent Rights Agreement. Apogent has taken all action so that
the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any
rights to any Person under the Apogent Rights Agreement or enable, require or
cause the Apogent Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered thereunder.

      SECTION 3.2     Representations and Warranties of Fisher and Merger Sub.
Except as set forth in (x) the disclosure schedule dated as of the date of this
Agreement and executed and delivered by Fisher and Merger Sub to Apogent
concurrently with or prior to the execution and delivery by Fisher and Merger
Sub of this Agreement (the "Fisher Disclosure Schedule") and (y) the Fisher SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof (as defined in Section 4.1(d), Fisher
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to Apogent as set forth in this Article
III. Each disclosure set forth in the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, and any other
information included in the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, is identified by
reference to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific
individual subsection of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be disclosed
solely for purposes of, and shall qualify and be treated as an exception to,
such subsection, except to the extent that disclosure in one subsection of the
Fisher Disclosure Schedule is specifically referred to in another subsection of
the Fisher Disclosure Schedule by appropriate cross-reference and except to the
extent that the relevance of a disclosure in one subsection of the Fisher
Disclosure Schedule to another subsection of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule is
reasonably apparent. The parties hereby agree that no reference to

                                       30
<PAGE>
or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Fisher Disclosure Schedule
shall be construed as an admission or indication that (1) such item or other
matter is material, (2) such item or other matter is required to be referred to
or disclosed in the Fisher Disclosure Schedule or (3) any breach or violation of
Applicable Laws or any Contract exists or has actually occurred.

            (a)   Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries.

                  (i)   Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Fisher and
      each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly
      organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
      jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
      jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or otherwise organized and has
      the requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority and all necessary
      government approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
      on its business as currently conducted, except for those jurisdictions in
      which the failure to have such power, authority or government approvals
      and to be so organized, existing or in good standing would not,
      individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(k)) on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of Fisher and each of its
      Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
      standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in
      each jurisdiction in which the nature or conduct of its business or the
      ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
      qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for those
      jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
      good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries,
      taken as a whole.

                  (ii)  Charter Documents. Fisher and Merger Sub have delivered
      or made available to Apogent prior to the execution of this Agreement
      complete and correct copies of (A) the Amended and Restated Certificate of
      Incorporation of Fisher (including any certificates of designation), as
      amended and currently in effect (the "Fisher Charter"), and the bylaws of
      Fisher, as amended and currently in effect (the "Fisher Bylaws," and,
      together with the Fisher Charter, the "Fisher Organizational Documents")
      and (B) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub and
      articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws or like organizational
      documents of each of the Fisher Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in
      Section 3.2(a)(iii)), as amended and currently in effect (collectively,
      the "Fisher Subsidiary Organizational Documents"), and each such
      instrument is in full force and effect. Fisher is not in material
      violation of the Fisher Organizational Documents and no Fisher Significant
      Subsidiary (as defined below) is in material violation of its Fisher
      Subsidiary Organizational Documents.

                  (iii) Subsidiaries. Section 3.2(a)(iii) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule lists all the Subsidiaries of Fisher which, as of the
      date of

                                       31
<PAGE>
      this Agreement, are significant subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of
      Regulation S-X of the SEC) (the "Fisher Significant Subsidiaries"). Except
      as set forth in Section 3.2(a)(iii) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, all
      the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
      each Fisher Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully
      paid and nonassessable (subject, in the case of Merger Sub, to Section
      180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL, as judicially interpreted, to the extent
      applicable) and are owned directly or indirectly by Fisher, free and clear
      of all Liens and free of any other restriction (including preemptive
      rights and any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
      of such capital stock or other ownership interests).

            (b)   Capital Structure.

                  (i)   The authorized capital stock of Fisher consists of
      500,000,000 shares of Fisher Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of

      2, 2003 (the "Fisher 2003 Plan") (such plans, collectively, the "Fisher
      Stock Plans"), complete and correct copies of which, in each case as
      amended, have been filed as exhibits to the Fisher SEC Documents (as
      defined in Section 3.2(d)(i)) prior to the date of this Agreement or
      delivered to Apogent; and (G) 1,653,585 warrants were issued and
      outstanding, with such warrants convertible into 1,653,585 shares of
      Fisher Common Stock. Each outstanding share of capital stock of Fisher is
      duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
      preemptive rights.

                  (ii)  As of the close of business on March 12, 2004,

      subject to issuance under the Fisher Stock Plans, upon issuance on the
      terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they
      are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

      commitments or agreements of any character to which Fisher is a party or
      otherwise bound obligating Fisher to accelerate the vesting of any Fisher
      Option as a result of the Merger (whether alone or upon the occurrence of

                                       32
<PAGE>
      any additional or subsequent events), and there are no outstanding or
      authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or
      other similar rights with respect to Fisher.

                  (iii) No Voting Debt of Fisher is issued or outstanding as of
      the date hereof.

                  (iv)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b)(iv) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule, as of March 12, 2004, there are no securities,
      options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
      undertakings of any kind to which Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries is a
      party or by which any of them is bound obligating Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
      or sold, additional shares of capital stock, Voting Debt or other voting
      securities of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligating Fisher or
      any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
      security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement
      or undertaking. All outstanding shares of Fisher Common Stock, all
      outstanding Fisher Options and all outstanding shares of capital stock of
      each Subsidiary of Fisher have been issued and granted in compliance in
      all material respects with (A) all applicable securities laws and all
      other Applicable Laws and (B) all requirements set forth in applicable
      material Contracts.

                  (v)   Since October 1, 2003, and through the date hereof,
      except as set forth in Section 3.2(b)(v) or Section 3.2(b)(ii) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, other than (A) issuances of Fisher Common
      Stock pursuant to the exercise of Fisher Options granted under Fisher

      Fisher following their termination pursuant to the terms of their
      pre-existing stock option or purchase agreements, (C) issuances of Fisher

      Plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
      there has been no change in (1) the outstanding capital stock of Fisher,
      (2) the number of Fisher Options outstanding or (3) the number of other
      options, warrants or other rights to purchase Fisher capital stock.

                  (vi)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b)(ii) or Section
      3.2(b)(vi) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, neither Fisher nor any of
      its Subsidiaries is a party to any currently effective agreement (A)
      restricting the purchase or transfer of, (B) relating to the voting of,

      the type referred to in Section 3.2(b)(iv) hereof.

                  (vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b)(vii) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule, other than its Subsidiaries, as of the date hereof,
      Fisher does not directly or indirectly beneficially own any securities or
      other beneficial ownership interests in any other entity except for
      non-controlling investments made in the ordinary

                                       33
<PAGE>
      course of business consistent with past practice in entities which are not
      individually or in the aggregate material to Fisher and its Subsidiaries,
      taken as a whole. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of
      Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries to make any loan to, or any equity or
      other investment (in the form of a capital contribution or otherwise) in,
      any Subsidiary of Fisher or any other Person, other than guarantees by
      Fisher of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-owned
      Subsidiary of Fisher and other than loans made in the ordinary course
      consistent with past practice to employees of Fisher and its Subsidiaries.

                  (viii) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
      1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, all of which
      shares are issued and outstanding. Fisher is the legal and beneficial
      owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub. Merger
      Sub was formed at the direction of Fisher prior to the date hereof, solely
      for the purposes of effecting the Merger and the other transactions
      contemplated hereby. Except as required by or provided for in this
      Agreement, Merger Sub (x) does not hold, nor has it held, any assets, (y)
      does not have, nor has it incurred, any liabilities and (z) has not
      carried on any business activities other than in connection with the
      Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. All of the outstanding
      shares of capital stock of Merger Sub have been duly authorized and
      validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
      any preemptive rights.

                  (ix)  Neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
      shares of capital stock of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
      Fisher nor Merger Sub is, or will become prior to the Effective Time, a
      "significant shareholder" or an "interested stockholder" with respect to
      Apogent within the meaning of Sections 180.1130(11) and 180.1140(8),
      respectively, of the WBCL.

            (c)   Authority; Board Approval; Voting Requirements; No Conflict;
Required Filings and Consents.

                  (i)   Authority. Each of Fisher and Merger Sub has all
      requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to
      perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
      contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
      Fisher and Merger Sub, and the consummation by Fisher and Merger Sub of
      the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly
      authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Fisher and
      Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Fisher or
      Merger Sub and no stockholder or shareholder votes, as applicable, are
      necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
      contemplated hereby, other than, with respect to approval of the Stock
      Issuance, the Fisher Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section
      3.2(c)(iii)). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
      Fisher and Merger Sub. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement by Apogent, this Agreement constitutes the
      legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Fisher and Merger Sub,
      enforceable against Fisher and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
      subject to applicable bankruptcy,

                                       34
<PAGE>
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or
      affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general
      principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
      equity or at law).

                  (ii)  Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Fisher has (A)
      determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the Stock Issuance are
      advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Fisher and its
      shareholders, (B) duly approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger,
      the Stock Issuance and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which
      adoption has not been rescinded or modified, (C) resolved (subject to
      Section 4.2(d)) to recommend the Stock Issuance to its stockholders for
      approval and (D) subject to Section 5.1(b), directed that the Stock
      Issuance be submitted to its stockholders for consideration in accordance
      with this Agreement.

                  (iii) Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote of the holders
      of a majority of the outstanding shares of Fisher Common Stock present in
      person or by proxy in favor of the Stock Issuance at a meeting duly called
      and held for approval of the Stock Issuance (the "Fisher Stockholder
      Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
      Fisher capital stock necessary to approve the Stock Issuance, and no other
      vote of the holders of any class or series of Fisher capital stock is
      necessary to approve the Stock Issuance.

                  (iv)  No Conflict. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c)(iv)
      of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this
      Agreement by Fisher and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Fisher
      and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by
      Fisher and Merger Sub with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
      conflict with, result in any violation or breach of or change of control
      or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
      require any consent, waiver or approval under, give rise to any right of
      termination or cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or
      loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
      the properties or assets of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries or any
      restriction on the conduct of Fisher's business or operations under, (A)
      the Fisher Organizational Documents or the Fisher Subsidiary
      Organizational Documents, (B) any Contract or Fisher Permit (as defined in
      Section 3.2(g)(i)) or (C) subject to the governmental filings and other
      matters referred to in Section 3.2(c)(v), any judgment, order, decree,
      statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Fisher or any of
      its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in
      the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults,
      rights, losses, restrictions or Liens, or failure to obtain consents,
      waivers or approvals, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Merger Sub.

                  (v)   Required Filings or Consents. No consent, approval,
      order or authorization or permit of, action by or in respect of,
      registration,

      declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Entity or
      any other Person is required to be made, obtained, performed or given to
      or with respect to Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
      the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Fisher or Merger Sub, the
      approval of the Stock Issuance or the consummation by Fisher or Merger Sub
      of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for:

      (A)   the filing of a pre-merger notification and report form by Fisher
            and Merger Sub under the HSR Act and any applicable filings or
            notifications under the antitrust, competition or similar laws of
            any foreign jurisdiction;

      (B)   the filing with the SEC of:

            (1)   the Form S-4 (including the Joint Proxy Statement);

            (2)   such reports and filings under Section 13(a), 13(d), 14(a),
                  15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
                  regulations thereunder as may be required in connection with
                  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

      (C)   the filing of the Articles of Merger with the DFI and appropriate
            documents with the NYSE and the relevant authorities of other states

      (F)   other such consents, approvals, orders or authorizations, the
            failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or in the
            aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
            Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
            Merger Sub.

            (d)   SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

                  (i)   Fisher has filed with the SEC all registration
      statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
      certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
      information incorporated by reference therein) presently required to be so
      filed by Fisher since October 1, 2002 (excluding the Form S-4 and the
      Joint Proxy Statement, the "Fisher SEC

                                       36
<PAGE>
      Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Fisher SEC Documents
      complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
      Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, to the extent in effect, SOX
      and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
      to such Fisher SEC Documents, and none of the Fisher SEC Documents, when
      filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
      state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
      to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
      they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a
      subsequently filed Fisher SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the
      date hereof. No Subsidiary of Fisher is subject to the periodic reporting
      requirements of the Exchange Act.

                  (ii)  Each of the principal executive officer of Fisher and
      the principal financial officer of Fisher (or each former principal
      executive officer of Fisher and each former principal financial officer of
      Fisher, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14
      or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the
      rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to
      the Fisher SEC Documents. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
      "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
      the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither Apogent nor any of its
      Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions
      of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of
      Section 402 of SOX.

                  (iii) The financial statements of Fisher included in the
      Fisher SEC Documents, including each Fisher SEC Document filed after the
      date hereof until the Effective Time, comply, as of their respective dates
      of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable
      accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
      with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except,
      in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or 8-K of
      the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
      as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
      consolidated financial position of Fisher and its consolidated
      Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
      operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
      of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are
      not material). The financial books and records of Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are true and correct in all material
      respects.

                  (iv)  Except as reflected or reserved against in the balance
      sheet of Fisher, dated December 31, 2003, included in the Form 10-K filed
      by Fisher with the SEC on March 12, 2004 (including the notes thereto, the
      "Fisher Balance Sheet") and except as set forth in Section 3.2(d)(iv) of
      the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries
      has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether absolute,
      accrued, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise) nor, to the Knowledge
      of Fisher, does any basis exist

                                       37
<PAGE>
      therefor, other than (A) liabilities or obligations incurred since January
      1, 2004 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
      which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
      on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) liabilities or
      obligations under the Fisher Material Contracts set forth in Section
      3.2(q)(ii) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, (C) liabilities or
      obligations incurred pursuant to Contracts entered into after the date
      hereof not in violation of this Agreement and (D) liabilities or
      obligations incurred pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
      contemplated hereby.

                  (v)   Except as set forth in Section 3.2(d)(v) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule, neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
      to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
      off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
      (including without limitation any contract or arrangement relating to any
      transaction or relationship between or among Fisher and any of its
      Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
      without limitation any structured finance, special purpose or limited
      purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
      arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S of the SEC)),
      where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
      arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
      or material liabilities of, Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries in Fisher's
      or such Subsidiary's published financial statements or other Fisher SEC
      Documents.

                  (vi)  No "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
      601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) filed as an exhibit to the Fisher
      Form 10-K has been amended or modified, except for amendments or
      modifications permitted under this Agreement which have been filed as an
      exhibit to a subsequently dated Fisher SEC Document or are not required to
      be filed with the SEC.

            (e)   Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Fisher or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to Fisher's stockholders or
at the time of the Fisher Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.2(e), no representation or warranty is made by Fisher with respect to
information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement which were not supplied by or on behalf of Fisher.

                  (f)   Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

                        (i)   Except as set forth in Section 3.2(f) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2004 through the date hereof,
      except as and to the extent disclosed in the Fisher SEC Documents filed
      prior to the date of this Agreement and except for liabilities incurred
      pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby:

            (A)   Fisher and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only
                  in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

            (B)   there has not been any split, combination or reclassification
                  of any of Fisher's capital stock or any declaration, setting
                  aside or payment of any dividend on, or other distribution
                  (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, in lieu of
                  or in substitution for, shares of Fisher's capital stock;

            (C)   except as required by a change in GAAP, there has not been any
                  change in accounting methods, principles or practices by
                  Fisher; and

            (D)   there has not been any action taken by Fisher or any of its
                  Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of
                  this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a
                  breach of Section 4.1(b), other than actions in connection
                  with entering into this Agreement.

                        (ii)  Since January 1, 2004 through the date hereof,
      there have not been any changes, circumstances or events that,
      individually or in the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be
      expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (g)   Compliance with Applicable Laws; Permits; Litigation.

                        (i)   Fisher, its Subsidiaries and employees hold all
      authorizations, permits, licenses, certificates, easements, concessions,
      franchises, variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations,
      approvals and clearances of all Governmental Entities (including all
      authorizations under the FDCA and the regulations of the FDA promulgated
      thereunder) and third Persons which are required for Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties and other assets and
      to carry on their respective businesses in the manner described in the
      Fisher SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as they are being
      conducted as of the date hereof (the "Fisher Permits"), and all Fisher
      Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure
      to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to be valid
      or in full force and effect of, any such Fisher Permits, individually or
      in the aggregate, would not


                                       39
<PAGE>
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                        (ii)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(g)(ii) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, Fisher and its Subsidiaries are, and have been
      at all times since October 1, 2002, in compliance with the terms of the
      Fisher Permits and all Applicable Laws relating to Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or properties, except
      where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of the Fisher Permits
      or such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(g)(ii)
      of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, since October 1, 2002, neither Fisher
      nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notification from any
      Governmental Entity (A) asserting that Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries
      is not in compliance with, or at any time since such date has failed to
      comply with, Applicable Laws (except for any such lack of compliance
      which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as
      a whole) or (B) threatening to revoke any Permit (except for any such
      revocation which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
      be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) nor, to the Knowledge of Fisher, does any
      basis exist therefore. As of the date hereof, no material investigation or
      review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of
      Fisher, has been threatened in writing against Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries.

                        (iii) Except with respect to Section 404 of SOX, Fisher
      is, and has been, in compliance in all material respects with the
      provisions of SOX applicable to it on or prior to the date hereof and has
      implemented such programs and has taken all reasonable steps necessary to
      ensure Fisher's future compliance (not later than the relevant statutory
      and regulatory deadlines therefor) with all provisions of SOX which shall
      become applicable to Fisher after the date hereof.

                        (iv)  As of the date hereof, except as and to the extent
      disclosed in the Fisher SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
      Agreement, including the notes to the financial statements included
      therein, no action, audit, demand, claim, suit, proceeding, requirement or
      investigation by any Governmental Entity, and no suit, action, mediation,
      arbitration or proceeding by any Person, against or affecting Fisher or
      any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, including
      Intellectual Property, is pending or, to the Knowledge of Fisher,
      threatened which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries,
      taken as a whole, or Merger Sub.

                        (v)   Neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or
      at any time since October 1, 2002 has been, subject to any outstanding
      order, injunction or decree which, individually or in the aggregate, has
      had or would reasonably be


                                       40
<PAGE>
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries,
      taken as a whole.

                  (h)   Labor and Other Employment Matters.

                        (i)   As of the date hereof, except as would not,
      individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
      or as set forth in Section 3.2(h)(i) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule,
      (A) no work stoppage, slowdown, lockout, labor strike, material
      arbitrations or other material labor disputes against Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries are pending or, to the Knowledge of Fisher, threatened, (B)
      no unfair labor practice charges, grievances or complaints are pending or,
      to the Knowledge of Fisher, threatened against Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries, (C) neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent
      in payments to any of its employees for any wages, salaries, commissions,
      bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed for it or
      amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees, (D) neither Fisher
      nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any payment to any trust or
      other fund or to any Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment
      compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations
      for employees, (E) no employee of Fisher at the officer level or above has
      given written notice to Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries that any such
      employee intends to terminate his or her employment with Fisher or any of
      its Subsidiaries, (F) to the Knowledge of Fisher, no employee of Fisher or
      any of its Subsidiaries is in any respect in violation of any term of any
      employment contract, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure
      obligations, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a
      former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed
      by Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business
      conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of
      others,(G) neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
      otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any
      Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices and (H)
      Fisher and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws,
      agreements, contracts, policies, plans and programs relating to
      employment, employment practices, compensation, benefits, hours, terms and
      conditions of employment and the termination of employment, including but
      not limited to any obligations pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and
      Retraining Notification Act of 1988.

                        (ii)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(h)(ii) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof,

                              (A)   neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries
            is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any collective bargaining
            agreement or any other agreement, work rules or practices with a
            labor union, labor


                                       41
<PAGE>
            organization or works council, nor are any such agreements, work
            rules or practices presently being negotiated;

                              (B)   none of the employees of Fisher or any of
            its Subsidiaries is represented by any labor union, labor
            organization or works council in his or her capacity as an employee
            of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries;

                              (C)   no labor union, labor organization or works
            council or group of employees of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries
            has made a pending demand for recognition or certification to Fisher
            or any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no representation or
            certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation
            proceeding presently pending or, to the Knowledge of Fisher,
            threatened to be brought or filed with the NLRB or any other labor
            relations tribunal or authority; and

                              (D)   to the Knowledge of Fisher, no labor union,
            labor organization or works council is seeking to organize any
            employees of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (i)   Benefit Plans.

                        (i)   Section 3.2(i)(i)(A) of the Fisher Disclosure
      Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each Benefit Plan with or
      for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of
      Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates or with respect to
      which Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates have any
      obligations or liabilities (the "Fisher Benefit Plans"). With respect to
      the Fisher Benefit Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no
      condition or set of circumstances, which would reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole, under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Laws. Neither Fisher,
      nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Fisher, any other
      Person, has any express or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable
      or not, to modify, change or terminate any Fisher Benefit Plan, other than
      with respect to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or
      the Code or any other Applicable Laws. Except as set forth in Section
      3.2(i)(i)(B) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, Fisher has delivered or
      made available to Apogent true, correct and complete copies of all Fisher
      Benefit Plans (or, if not so delivered, has delivered or made available to
      Apogent a written summary of their material terms) and, with respect
      thereto, all amendments, trust agreements, insurance Contracts, other
      funding vehicles, determination letters issued by the Internal Revenue
      Service, the most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series) filed with the
      Internal Revenue Service and the most recent actuarial report or other
      financial statement relating to such Fisher Benefit Plan.


                                       42
<PAGE>
                        (ii)  Each Fisher Benefit Plan has been, in all material
      respects, administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the
      applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable Laws and
      with the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each
      Fisher Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is
      capable of Approval has received such Approval (or there remains a period
      of time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any
      material amendment that has not previously received such Approval), and no
      event has occurred which would reasonably be expected to result in the
      revocation of such Approval or the imposition of material sanctions by
      such authorities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
      Fisher Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
      of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter from the
      Internal Revenue Service that the Fisher Benefit Plan is so qualified and
      all related trusts are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under
      Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of Fisher, nothing has
      occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which would cause the
      loss of such qualification or exemption.

                        (iii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(i)(iii) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Fisher, no oral or written
      representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any
      Fisher Benefit Plan has been made to an employee or former employee of
      Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries by an authorized Fisher employee that is
      not materially in accordance with the written or otherwise pre-existing
      terms and provisions of such Fisher Benefit Plans. To the Knowledge of
      Fisher, neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
      agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, with any
      trade union, works council or other employee representative body or any
      material number or category of its employees which would prevent, restrict
      or materially impede the implementation of any layoff, redundancy,
      severance or similar program within its or their respective workforces (or
      any part of them).

                        (iv)  There are no material unresolved claims or
      disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any Fisher Benefit
      Plan (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits), and no action,
      legal or otherwise, has been commenced or threatened with respect to any
      material claim or otherwise in connection with a Fisher Benefit Plan.

                        (v)   Except as set forth in Section 3.2(i)(v) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each Funded Retirement Plan of
      Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries, the aggregate value of the assets of
      such Funded Retirement Plan is equal to or greater than the aggregate
      value of its liabilities assessed on an ongoing and terminated basis and
      calculated in accordance with the actuarial methods and assumptions used
      in such valuation pursuant to such Funded Retirement Plan and Applicable
      Laws and GAAP. None of Fisher or any ERISA Affiliate of Fisher has
      incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any


                                       43
<PAGE>
      liability to a Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than
      for contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
      Corporation (other than for payment of premiums not yet due) that, when
      aggregated with other such liabilities, would reasonably be expected to
      result in a material liability of Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole, which liability has not been fully paid.

                        (vi)  Section 3.2(i)(vi) of the Fisher Disclosure
      Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each Multiemployer Plan to
      which Fisher or any ERISA Affiliate of Fisher contributes or is required
      to contribute, or to which, or with respect to which, Fisher or any ERISA
      Affiliate of Fisher has any material liability.

                        (vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(i)(vii) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, no Fisher Benefit Plan provides health
      benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to employees or former
      employees of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries after retirement or other
      termination of service (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Laws or
      benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former
      employee).

                        (viii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(i)(viii)(A) of
      the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, neither the negotiation and execution of
      this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
      hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
      subsequent events) constitute an event under any Fisher Benefit Plan that
      will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
      acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
      distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
      respect to any employee or former employee of Fisher or any of its
      Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(i)(viii)(B) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
      with an employee or former employee of Fisher to which Fisher or any of
      its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement that,
      individually or collectively and as a result of the transaction
      contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
      additional or subsequent events) or otherwise, would reasonably be
      expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
      deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

                  (j)   Taxes.

                        (i)   Each of Fisher and its Subsidiaries has (A) duly
      and timely filed (or there have been filed on its behalf) all material Tax
      Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable
      extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority and all such Tax Returns
      are true, correct and complete in all material respects, (B) duly paid in
      full or made provision in accordance with GAAP (or there has been paid or
      provision has been made on its behalf) for the payment of all material
      Taxes for all periods ending through the date hereof and


                                       44
<PAGE>
      (C) complied in all material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to
      the payment and withholding of Taxes.

                        (ii)  There are no material Liens for Taxes upon any
      property or assets of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries, except for liens
      for Taxes not yet due and payable and for which adequate reserves have
      been provided in accordance with GAAP in the most recent financial
      statements contained in the Fisher SEC Documents filed prior to the date
      of this Agreement.

                        (iii) The most recent financial statements contained in
      the Fisher SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with
      GAAP for all Tax liabilities of Fisher and its Subsidiaries for all
      taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
      financial statements.

                        (iv)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(j)(iv) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, there is no audit, examination, deficiency,
      refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with
      respect to any Taxes or Tax Return of Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries
      which, if determined adversely, would be expected to result in a material
      Tax deficiency. Neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
      written notice of any claim made by a Governmental Entity in a
      jurisdiction where Fisher or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does
      not file a Tax Return, that Fisher or such Subsidiary is or may be subject
      to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                        (v)   The material income Tax Returns of Fisher and each
      of its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors thereof, have been
      examined by the applicable Tax Authority (or the applicable statutes of
      limitations for the assessment of income Taxes for such periods have
      expired) for all periods through and including December 31, 2001, and no
      material deficiencies were asserted as a result of such examinations which
      have not been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a liability on the
      most recent financial statements contained in the Fisher SEC Documents.

                        (vi)  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(j)(vi) of the
      Fisher Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding requests, agreements,

compliance by Apogent with its obligations hereunder and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties made by Apogent herein, no other state
antitakeover statute or regulation, nor any takeover-related provision in the
Fisher Organizational Documents, would (i) prohibit or restrict Fisher's or
Merger Sub's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, any
related agreement or the Articles of Merger or its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement or the Articles of Merger, or any

impediment or condition in connection with the exercise of any of its rights
under this Agreement or the Articles of Merger.

opinions of each of its financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Lazard, dated the
date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio
is fair, from a financial point of view, to Fisher.

                  (q)   Material Contracts.

                        (i)   For purposes of this Agreement, "Fisher Material

            or any Subsidiary of Fisher (1) to indemnify or hold harmless
            another Person or group of Persons, unless such indemnification or
            hold harmless obligation to such Person, or group of Persons, as the
            case may be, would not reasonably be expected to exceed a maximum of

            the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business) or (2) not to

            Fisher);

                              (H)   Any indenture, mortgage, loan, guarantee or
            credit Contract under which Fisher or any Subsidiary of Fisher has

                              (J)   Any Contract (other than purchase or sale
            orders in the ordinary course of business that are terminable or
            cancelable without penalty on 90 days' notice or less) under which
            Fisher or any Subsidiary of Fisher is a purchaser or supplier of

                                       50
<PAGE>
                              (O)   Any Contract the termination or breach of
            which, or the failure to obtain consent in respect of, would
            reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher
            and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                        (ii)  Schedule. Section 3.2(q)(ii) of the Fisher
      Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all Fisher Material Contracts as
      of the date hereof. With respect to the Contracts described in (i) Section
      3.2(q)(i)(D), (F), (I), (J), (L) and (N) of this Agreement, Section
      3.2(q)(ii) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule sets forth only Contracts
      which require payments, or in the case of clause (D) involve obligations,
      in excess of $2,500,000 and (ii) Section 3.2(q)(i)(N) of this Agreement,
      Section 3.2(q)(ii) of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule sets forth only
      Contracts involving payments to Fisher, or any Subsidiary of Fisher, in
      excess of $10,000,000.

                        (iii) No Breach. All Fisher Material Contracts are valid
      and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their
      respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the
      rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general principles of
      equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
      law), except to the extent that (A) they have previously expired in
      accordance with their terms or (B) the failure to be in full force and
      effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its Subsidiaries, taken as
      a whole. Neither Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to Fisher's
      Knowledge, any counterparty to any Fisher Material Contract, has violated
      any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or
      without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the
      provisions of, any Fisher Material Contract, except in each case for those
      violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fisher and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (r)   Real Property. Section 3.2(r)(i) of the Fisher
Disclosure Schedule lists all material real property owned in fee by Fisher or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Fisher Owned Real Property") or leased by Fisher
or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee (the "Fisher Leased Real Property"). Fisher
or any of its Subsidiaries owns good and valid title to the Fisher Owned Real
Property and has valid and enforceable leasehold interests under the leases with
respect to the Fisher Leased Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other
than (i) Permitted Liens and (ii) easements, covenants, rights-of-way and other
encumbrances or restrictions, whether recorded or referred to in an applicable
lease or unrecorded, which do not materially impair the continued use of the
property subject thereto as currently used, but in no event, with respect to
clauses (i) and (ii), environmental or Tax Liens, judgments, lis pendens or any
Lien that would render the title to the Fisher Owned Real Property uninsurable
by a reputable title insurance company. All of the improvements located on any
Fisher Owned Real Property or Fisher Leased Real Property are in good condition
and repair (subject to normal wear and tear) without any structural defects of
any kind. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(r)(i) of the Fisher Disclosure
Schedule, each material lease with respect to the Fisher Leased Real Property is
valid, unmodified and in full force and effect, and there are no material
subleases with respect to the Fisher Leased Real Property. Neither any landlord
nor Fisher nor any of its Subsidiaries party to


                                       51
<PAGE>
any material lease with respect to the Fisher Leased Real Property is in
monetary or other material default under any such lease.

                  (s)   Merger Sub Approval. The Board of Directors of Merger
Sub, by written consent duly adopted prior to the date hereof, (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of Merger Sub and its shareholder, (ii) duly approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which
adoption has not been rescinded or modified, and (iii) submitted this Agreement
for adoption by Fisher, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. Promptly
following the date hereof, Fisher, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, will
have duly approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger.

activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and will use

confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) relating to
any such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

                  (b)   Notification of Alternative Transactions. As promptly as

promptly as possible with oral and written notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep the other party informed in all
material respects of all oral or written communications regarding, and the
status and details (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry,

to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

                  (c)   Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 4.2(a), in the event that Apogent or Fisher, as
the case may be, receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative
Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance with Section 8.3(p)) to
be, or is reasonably likely to be, a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
8.3(p)), it may then take the following actions (but only (1) if and to the
extent that (y) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, under Applicable Laws, and (z)
Apogent or Fisher, as the case may be, has given the other party at least two
business days prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following
actions and of the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and (2) if it shall not have breached in any
material respect any of the provisions of this Section 4.2):

                        (i)   Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or
      group of Persons making such Superior Proposal, provided that (A) prior to
      furnishing any such nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or
      group of Persons an executed confidentiality and standstill agreement
      containing terms at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the
      Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2004, between Fisher and
      Apogent (the "CDA") and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
      nonpublic information to such Person or group of Persons, it furnishes
      such nonpublic information to the other party hereto (to the extent such
      nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to such party);
      and

                        (ii)  Engage in discussions or negotiations with such
      Person or group of Persons with respect to such Superior Proposal.

                  (d)   Changes of Recommendation.

                        (i)   Solely in response to the receipt of an
      unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is
      determined (in accordance with Section 8.3(p)) to be a Superior Proposal,
      the Board of Directors


                                       60
<PAGE>
      of Apogent or Fisher, as the case may be, may make a Change of
      Recommendation (as defined in Section 4.2(d)(ii)), if all of the following
      conditions in clauses (A) through (E) are met:

                              (A)   The Superior Proposal has been made and has
            not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

                              (B)   The Apogent Shareholders' Meeting or Fisher
            Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, has not occurred;

                              (C)   Apogent or Fisher, as the case may be, has
            (1) provided to the other party hereto three business days' prior
            written notice which shall state expressly (x) that it has received
            a Superior Proposal, (y) the material terms and conditions of the
            Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
            making the Superior Proposal, and (z) that it intends to effect a
            Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do
            so, (2) provided to the other party hereto all materials and
            information delivered or made available to the Person or group of
            Persons making the Superior Proposal in connection with such
            Superior Proposal and (3) during the aforementioned period, if
            requested by the other party hereto, engaged in good faith
            negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
            Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to be a
            Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal;

                              (D)   The Board of Directors of Apogent or Fisher,
            as the case may be, has determined in good faith, after consultation
            with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
            Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change
            of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
            fiduciary obligations to its shareholders or stockholders, as
            applicable, under Applicable Laws; and

                              (E)   Apogent or Fisher, as the case may be, shall
            have complied with Section 4.2(c) and shall not have breached in any
            material respect any of the other provisions set forth in this
            Section 4.2.

                        (ii)  A "Change of Recommendation" shall mean the
      withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification or modification of the
      Board of Directors' recommendation in favor of, in the case of Apogent,
      approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of
      Fisher, the Stock Issuance, and, in the case of a tender or exchange offer
      made directly to Apogent's


                                       61
<PAGE>
      shareholders or Fisher's stockholders, as the case may be, a
      recommendation that Apogent's shareholders or Fisher's stockholders, as
      the case may be, accept the tender or exchange offer.

                  (e)   Compliance with Tender Offer Rules. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit Apogent or Fisher or their respective Boards of
Directors from taking and disclosing to their shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable, a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; provided that neither Apogent nor Fisher shall effect,
or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which constitutes, a
Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of
Section 4.2(d).

                                   ARTICLE V

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            SECTION 5.1 Preparation of SEC Documents; Shareholders' Meetings.

                  (a)   As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Fisher and Apogent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and Fisher shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Fisher
and Apogent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. Fisher will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Fisher's stockholders, and Apogent will
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Apogent's shareholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Fisher shall also
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of
process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of Fisher Common Stock in
the Merger and the conversion of Apogent Options into options to acquire Fisher
Common Stock, and Apogent shall furnish all information concerning Apogent and
the holders of Apogent Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Fisher without Apogent's prior
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and without providing Apogent
the opportunity to review and comment thereon. Fisher will advise Apogent
promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Fisher
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly provide
Apogent with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to Fisher or
Apogent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Fisher or Apogent which


                                       62
<PAGE>
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders or shareholders, as
applicable, of Fisher and Apogent.

                  (b)   Each of Apogent and Fisher shall, as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Laws and the Apogent
Organizational Documents, in the case of Apogent, and the Fisher Organizational
Documents, in the case of Fisher, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, to be held as
promptly as practicable to consider, in the case of Fisher, the Stock Issuance
(the "Fisher Stockholders' Meeting") and, in the case of Apogent, the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Apogent Shareholders'
Meeting"). Subject to Section 4.2(d), each of Apogent and Fisher will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, proxies in favor of, in the case of Fisher, the
Stock Issuance, and, in the case of Apogent, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger, and will take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure the vote or consent of its shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable, required by the rules of the NYSE or Applicable Laws to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Apogent or Fisher may adjourn or postpone the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting or
Fisher Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
is provided to its respective stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, in
advance of a vote on, in the case of Fisher, the Stock Issuance and, in the case
of Apogent, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if,
as of the time for which the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting or Fisher
Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Apogent Common Stock or Fisher Common Stock, as the case
may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Each of Apogent and Fisher
shall ensure that the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting and the Fisher Stockholders'
Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting
or Fisher Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance
with Applicable Laws, the rules of the NYSE and, in the case of Apogent, the
Apogent Organizational Documents, and, in the case of Fisher, the Fisher
Organizational Documents. Except with respect to matters as to which preliminary
proxy materials would not be required to be filed with the SEC, without the
prior written consent of Apogent, the Stock Issuance is the only matter which
Fisher shall propose to be acted on by Fisher's stockholders at the Fisher
Stockholders' Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Fisher, approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is the only matter which Apogent shall
propose to be acted on by Apogent's shareholders at the Apogent Shareholders'
Meeting.

                  (c)   Each of Apogent and Fisher will use commercially
reasonable efforts to hold the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting and Fisher
Stockholders' Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other party and as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

                  (d)   Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section
4.2(d): (i) the Board of Directors of each of Apogent and Fisher shall recommend
that its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, vote in favor of, in the
case of Apogent, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at
the Apogent Shareholders' Meeting, and, in the case of Fisher, the Stock
Issuance at the Fisher Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A)
Fisher has recommended that Fisher's stockholders vote in favor of the Stock
Issuance and (B) Apogent has recommended that Apogent's shareholders vote in
favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Apogent
Shareholders' Meeting and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Apogent or
Fisher nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or
resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the
recommendation of its respective Board of Directors that the respective
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, of Apogent or Fisher vote in favor
of, in the case of Apogent, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger, and, in the case of Fisher, the Stock Issuance.

            SECTION 5.2 Accountant's Letters. Each of Apogent and Fisher shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party
two letters from their respective independent accountants, one dated
approximately as of the date the Form S-4 is declared effective and one dated
approximately as of the Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary in scope
and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

            SECTION 5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to
the CDA and Applicable Laws, each of Fisher and Apogent shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of such other party, full access at all reasonable times on
reasonable notice during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
(provided, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of such party) and, during such period and subject to the CDA and
Applicable Laws, each of Fisher and Apogent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request. No review pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

                  (b)   Each of Fisher and Apogent will hold and keep
confidential, and will cause its respective officers and employees and will
direct its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and


                                       64
<PAGE>
other representatives and Affiliates to hold and keep confidential, any
nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the CDA.

            SECTION 5.4 Reasonable Efforts.

                  (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, including all filings required under the HSR Act, with the
Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice and any
necessary antitrust, competition or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Subject to
Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Apogent and Fisher
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Apogent and its Subsidiaries or Fisher and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third Person or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b)   Promptly following the date hereof, Apogent shall (i)
cause Apogent Holdings Denmark A/S to be converted into an Anpartsselskab, and
(ii) submit a ruling request to the appropriate Danish authorities in order to
treat the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares by Apogent Holdings
Denmark A/S (or any successor entity) as a share sale for Danish income Tax
purposes. In addition, prior to the Closing Date, Apogent shall cause Apogent
Holdings Denmark A/S (or any successor entity) to be treated as a disregarded
entity for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

                  (c)   Each of Fisher and Apogent shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining all required approvals or consents of any Governmental Entity (whether
domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard, each party shall without
limitation: (i) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the
other with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise
the other orally of) any communications from or with any Governmental Entity
(whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with respect to the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this


                                       65
<PAGE>
Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written
(or any material proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) not participate in any meeting with any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance and to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity gives the other the opportunity to attend
and participate thereat, (iv) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Merger, and (v) furnish the other with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as Fisher or Apogent, as applicable, may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions
of information to any such Governmental Entity. Each of Fisher and Apogent may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as "outside
counsel only." Such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Fisher or Apogent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

                  (d)   In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,
Fisher and Apogent shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Fisher nor Apogent shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or divest or take any other action with
respect to any of its businesses or assets or enter into any consent decree or
other agreement that would restrict it in the conduct of its business as
heretofore conducted if such action is reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Fisher, including a Material Adverse Effect on the total
benefits expected to be realized by Fisher after completion of the Merger.

                  (f)   Promptly following the date hereof, Apogent and Fisher
shall cooperate in determining a mutually acceptable manner in which to cause no
Apogent Subsidiary to own, beneficially or of record, directly or indirectly,
any shares of Apogent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Apogent shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions proposed by Fisher and
legally available to Apogent in order to effect the result described in the
preceding sentence.

      SECTION 5.5 Indemnification and Insurance.

            (a)   From and after the Effective Time, Fisher will, and will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of Apogent pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Apogent and its
directors, officers and employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to Applicable Laws. For at least six years after the Effective
Time, Fisher shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of Apogent and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") for any costs, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative) by reason of the fact that such Person was an officer, director
or employee of Apogent or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including those related
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and shall advance
expenses in respect thereof, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws.

            (b)   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Apogent with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred on or before the Effective Time (including those related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to former officers and directors of Apogent) only with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; and provided, further, that if the aggregate annual premiums for such
policies at any time during such period will exceed 300% of the per annum
premium rate paid by Apogent and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such
policies, then Fisher shall only be required to provide such coverage as will
then be available at an annual premium equal to 300% of such rate.

            (c)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is made or brought against any Indemnified Party on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.5
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

            (d)   If Fisher, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Fisher shall take
such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.

            (e)   The provisions of this Section 5.5 are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.


                                       67
<PAGE>
      SECTION 5.6 Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in this Section 5.6 and
in Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except that each of Apogent and Fisher shall bear and pay one-half
of the costs and expenses incurred by Fisher, Merger Sub or Apogent (other than
attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and related expenses) in connection with (i)
the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 (including financial statements
and exhibits), the Joint Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees) and any
preliminary materials related thereto and (ii) the filings of the premerger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act and any applicable antitrust,
competition or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction (including filing fees).

      SECTION 5.7 Public Announcements. Apogent and Fisher will use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and will provide
each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as either party may
determine is required by Applicable Laws, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or stock
market. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties.

      SECTION 5.8 Listing. Fisher shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Fisher Common Stock issuable under Article II, and those shares of
Fisher Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the
Merger, to be authorized for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of
issuance.

      SECTION 5.9 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. Fisher and Apogent hereby
adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Fisher and Apogent intend that
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and each shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither Fisher,
Merger Sub nor Apogent shall take any action, cause or permit any action to be
taken, or fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to cause
the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

      SECTION 5.10 Conveyance Taxes. Apogent and Fisher shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees or any similar taxes which become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. Apogent shall
pay on behalf of its shareholders and out of its own funds any such Taxes or
fees which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for which such shareholders are primarily liable and in no event
shall Fisher pay such amounts.


                                       68

      SECTION 5.11 Equity Awards and Employee Benefits.

            (a)   (i)   At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Apogent
Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall become fully
vested and exercisable and will be assumed by Fisher, which shall continue to
treat such Apogent Options as fully vested and exercisable. Subject to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the applicable Apogent Stock Plan and option award
agreement, each Apogent Option so assumed by Fisher under this Agreement will
otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in the applicable Apogent Option (including any applicable option award
agreement or other document evidencing such Apogent Option) immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights), except that (A) each
Apogent Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Fisher
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Apogent Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Apogent Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time (disregarding any vesting schedule applicable to such
option) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Fisher Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Fisher Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Apogent
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Apogent Common Stock of such Apogent Option by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (ii)  Fisher shall take all requisite action such that, at the
      Effective Time, all awards based on Apogent Common Stock that are
      restricted stock units granted under the Apogent Stock Plans ("Apogent
      Restricted Stock Units") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
      Time shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable immediately prior to the
      Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1(d).

                  (iii) Apogent shall, and shall be permitted under this
      Agreement, to take all corporate action necessary, including, but not
      limited to, amending any Apogent Option, Apogent equity award agreement
      thereunder, or Apogent Stock Plan, to effectuate the provisions of Section
      5.11(a)(i) and (ii). In addition, Fisher shall, or shall cause the
      Surviving Corporation to, cooperate with Apogent and take all requisite
      action to effectuate such provisions. As soon as reasonably practicable,
      but in no event later than 10 business days following the Effective Time,
      Fisher will (A) issue to each holder of an assumed Apogent Option a
      document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Apogent Option by
      Fisher, (B) issue appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights
      pursuant to the assumed Apogent Options (including that, as applicable,
      pursuant to the terms of the Apogent Stock Plans, the Merger constitutes a
      "Change in Control" (or "Change of Control," as applicable) (as either
      such term is defined in each applicable Apogent Stock Plan)), and (C)
      issue appropriate notices to each holder of an assumed Apogent Option or
      any Apogent Restricted Stock Units setting forth the effect of the Merger
      on the Apogent Options and the Apogent Restricted Stock Units. Prior to
      the Effective Time, Fisher shall take all corporate action necessary to
      reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Fisher Common Stock
      for delivery in connection with the exercise of the converted Apogent


                                       69
<PAGE>
      Options. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
      ensure that the conversion of any Apogent Options which are intended to be
      "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) provided
      for in this Section 5.11(a) shall be effected in a manner consistent with
      Section 424(a) of the Code.

            (b)   Apogent shall terminate the Apogent Purchase Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any offering period under the Apogent
Purchase Plan is in progress prior to such termination, Apogent shall ensure
that such offering period ends immediately prior to such termination, and that
each participant's accumulated contributions for such offering period are
applied towards the purchase of Apogent Common Stock immediately prior to such
termination unless the participant has previously withdrawn from such offering
period in accordance with the terms of such plan.

            (c)   From and after the Closing Date and for two years thereafter
(the "Benefit Continuation Period"), Fisher shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to current and former employees, directors, and consultants of Apogent
and its Subsidiaries, benefits (other than stock option plans) that in the
aggregate are no less favorable than the benefits provided, in the aggregate,
under the Apogent Benefit Plans in which such current and former employees,
directors and consultants participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which plans are set forth in Section 3.1(i)(i)(A) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule (or if not so set forth, then such other Apogent Benefit Plans at the
subsidiary level in which such individuals participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time).

            (d)   Fisher shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
take all actions set forth in Section 5.11(d) of the Apogent Disclosure
Schedule.

            (e)   During the Benefit Continuation Period, post-retirement
medical benefits to former employees of Apogent and its Subsidiaries or any
employees of Apogent and its Subsidiaries who are eligible as of the Closing
Date for post-retirement medical benefits under Apogent Benefit Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be provided as set forth in Section
5.11(e) of the Apogent Disclosure Schedule.

            (f)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any
period of time for, or preclude the ability of either party to terminate, any
continuing employee for any reason or (ii) subject to the limitations and
requirements specifically set forth in this Section 5.11, require either party
to continue any Fisher Benefit Plan or Apogent Benefit Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time.

      SECTION 5.12 Fisher Corporate Governance. (a) Board of Directors. On or
prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Fisher shall cause the
number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of Fisher
immediately following the Effective Time to be 10. Of the members of such Board
of Directors, six shall be current directors of the Board of Directors of Fisher
as identified in Section 5.12 of the Fisher Disclosure Schedule, and four shall
be directors designated by Apogent as identified in Section 5.12 of the Fisher
Disclosure Schedule. Each such director shall serve on the class of the Board of
Directors of

            (b)   Other Matters. Immediately following the Effective Time, Frank
H. Jellinek, Jr. shall be appointed as "Chairman Emeritus" of Fisher.

      SECTION 5.13 Affiliate Legends. Apogent shall notify Fisher in writing of
the identity of those Persons who are, in Apogent's reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of Apogent within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145 Affiliates") prior to the Closing Date. Fisher shall
be entitled to place appropriate legends (reasonably acceptable to Apogent) on
the certificates evidencing any shares of Fisher Common Stock to be received by
Rule 145 Affiliates in the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for Fisher Common Stock (provided, that such
legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed, one year after the
Effective Time, upon the request of any holder of shares of Fisher Common Stock
issued in the Merger if such holder is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate).

      SECTION 5.14 Notification of Certain Matters. Fisher shall give prompt
notice to Apogent and Apogent shall give prompt notice to Fisher, as the case
may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence
or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to cause (a)(i) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement that is not qualified as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in
each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of Fisher and the Merger Sub or
Apogent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In
addition, Fisher shall give prompt notice to Apogent and Apogent shall give
prompt notice to Fisher, as the case may be, of any change or event having, or
which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article
VI to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.14 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

      SECTION 5.15 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Fisher and Apogent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all
such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws) to
cause any dispositions of Apogent Common Stock (including derivative securities)
or acquisitions of Fisher Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Fisher Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Apogent to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in
accordance with the No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC
to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher


                                       71

& Flom LLP. The parties acknowledge that all such above referenced dispositions
and acquisitions are compensatory in nature.

      SECTION 5.16 Rights Plans; State Takeover Laws.

            (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Apogent shall not redeem the
Apogent Rights or amend, modify (other than to delay any "distribution date"
therein or to render the Apogent Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any action
permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the Apogent Rights Agreement unless
(i) required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii)
Apogent's Board of Directors, as the case may be, has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a Superior
Proposal with respect to it, the failure to effect such amendment, modification
or termination is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its Board of
Directors' fiduciary obligations to its shareholders under Applicable Laws.

            (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, neither Apogent nor Fisher shall
take any action to render inapplicable or to exempt any third Person from, any
state takeover law or state law that purports to limit or restrict business
combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares of capital stock unless
(i) required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii)
Fisher's or Apogent's Board of Directors, as the case may be, has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of
a Superior Proposal with respect to it, the failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its Board of Directors' fiduciary
obligations to its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, under Applicable
Laws.

      SECTION 5.17 Reservation of Fisher Common Stock. Effective at or prior to
the Effective Time, Fisher shall reserve (free from preemptive rights) out of
its reserved but unissued shares of Fisher Common Stock, for the purposes of
effecting the conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Apogent Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement, sufficient shares of Fisher Common Stock to
provide for such conversion as well as the issuance of Fisher Common Stock upon
the exercise of Apogent Options assumed by Fisher under Section 5.11.

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Fisher or Apogent, as the case may be, fails to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party hereto makes a claim that results in a judgment against
the party failing to pay for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the
party so failing to pay shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3

this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 7.2.

            (d)   Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Section 7.3
only, "Acquisition," with respect to a party hereto, shall mean any of the
following transactions (other than the Merger): (i) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar

occurrence of either the Apogent Shareholder Approval or the Fisher Stockholder
Approval there may not be, without further approval of the shareholders of

the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Apogent Common
Stock hereunder, or which by Applicable Laws otherwise expressly requires the
further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party hereto with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part
of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any extension or waiver
given in compliance with this Section 7.5 or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

      SECTION 8.5 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined


                                       87
<PAGE>
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or
in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

      SECTION 8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties.

      SECTION 8.7 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the CDA and the documents and instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and neither party is relying on any other oral
or written representation, agreement or understanding and (b) except for the
provisions of Section 5.5 (which are intended to benefit the Indemnified
Parties, including Indemnified Parties who or which are not parties hereto), is
not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or
remedies.

      SECTION 8.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and any disputes arising out of
or related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof,
provided, however, that the Merger shall be governed by the WBCL.

      SECTION 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

      SECTION 8.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court,
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court.


                                       88

      SECTION 8.11 Headings, etc. The headings and table of contents contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

      SECTION 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Laws in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

      SECTION 8.13 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

      SECTION 8.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF FISHER, MERGER SUB AND APOGENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HERBY OR THE ACTIONS
OF FISHER, MERGER SUB OR APOGENT IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

      SECTION 8.15 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
