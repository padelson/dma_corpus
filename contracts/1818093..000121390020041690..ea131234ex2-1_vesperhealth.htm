(b) Upon receipt of the Parent Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholders'
Representative shall have thirty (30) days within which to review the Post-
Closing Merger Consideration Calculation after Parent's delivery of the Parent
Post-Closing Statement. The Stockholders' Representative may object to the
Post-Closing Merger Consideration Calculation set forth in the Parent Post-
Closing Statement by providing written notice of such objection to Parent
within thirty (30) days (the " _Objection Period_ ") after Parent's delivery
of the Parent Post-Closing Statement (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which
notice shall set forth the basis for such objection in reasonable detail,
along with the Stockholders' Representative's calculation and proposed
modification of each disputed item, together with supporting documentation,
information and the Stockholders' Representative's proposed calculations for
each disputed item. During such thirty (30)-day period and thereafter until
the determination of the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
2.05(b)_, the Stockholders' Representative and its advisors (including,
without limitation, its independent accounting firm) shall be provided with
prompt access (including remote access) to the financial books and records

papers) and personnel of the Company and Parent as they may reasonably
request to enable it to evaluate the calculations of the Company Transaction
Expenses the Net Working Capital Adjustment, Cash and Outstanding
Indebtedness prepared by Parent and set forth in the Parent Post-Closing
Statement. Such access shall be provided during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice. If the Stockholders' Representative does not
deliver a Notice of Objection within the Objection Period, then Parent's
calculation of each item contained in the Parent Post-Closing Statement shall
be deemed to be accepted by the Stockholders' Representative as final and
shall be conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto for all purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative timely provides the Notice of
Objection, then Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate
in good faith for a period of up to thirty (30) days following Parent's
receipt of the Notice of Objection in an attempt to resolve any disputed
matter set forth in the Notice of Objection, and any resolution by them in
writing shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

  



  

(d) If, within the thirty (30)-day period set forth in _Section 2.05(c)_,
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative cannot resolve any matter set
forth in the Notice of Objection, then Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall engage an independent, nationally recognized accounting
firm acceptable to both Parent and the Stockholders' Representative (the "
_Reviewing Accountant_ ") to review only the matters in the Notice of
Objection that are still disputed by Parent and Stockholders' Representative
and the Post-Closing Merger Consideration Calculation to the extent relevant
thereto. The Reviewing Accountant shall act in the capacity of an expert and
not as an arbitrator. Parent and the Stockholders' Representative will
instruct the Reviewing Accountant to, and the Reviewing Accountant will, make
a final determination of only such remaining disputed matters. Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative may each submit to the Reviewing Accountant
written submissions setting forth their respective computations of the
amounts set forth in the Notice of Objection (to the extent such amounts
remain in dispute) and specific information, evidence and support for their
respective positions as to all items in dispute. Neither Parent nor
the Stockholders' Representative shall have or conduct any communication,
either written or oral, with the Reviewing Accountant with respect to matters
contemplated by this Agreement without the other party either being present or
receiving a concurrent copy of any written communication. Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative will also instruct the Reviewing Accountant
to, and the Reviewing Accountant will, make its determination based solely on
the terms of this Agreement and written submissions by Parent and the Company
Stockholders that are provided in accordance with this Agreement ( _i.e._ ,
not on the basis of an independent review). The Reviewing Accountant shall
promptly (and in any event within sixty (60) days following its engagement)
determine the resolution of such remaining disputed matters either in favor
of the position set forth by Parent in the Parent Post-Closing Statement or
in favor of the position set forth by the Stockholders' Representative in the
Notice of Objection (it being agreed that the Reviewing Accountant may only
choose one or the other of these two positions). Such determination shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto, absent fraud or manifest error, and
the Reviewing Accountant shall provide Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative with a calculation of the Company Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital Adjustment, Cash, Outstanding Indebtedness and
Closing Merger Consideration in accordance with such determination.

(e) If the Closing Merger Consideration resulting from the calculation of
Cash, Outstanding Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital Adjustment, and the
Company Transaction Expenses, each as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.05_ (the " _Final Merger Consideration_ "), is less than the
Closing Merger Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement (such
difference, the " _Final Merger Consideration Shortfall_ "), Parent and
Stockholders' Representative shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the
Final Merger Consideration Shortfall (or, if less, the full amount of the
Adjustment Escrow Account) to Parent and to release the remainder, if any, of
the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Stockholders' Representative shall be
prepared, signed by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(f) If the Final Merger Consideration is equal to the Closing Merger
Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement, Parent and
Stockholders' Representative shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
full amount of the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Stockholders'
Representative.

  



  

(g) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger
Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement (such difference, the "
_Final Merger Consideration Surplus_ "), then (i) Parent and Stockholders'
Representative shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full amount
of the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Stockholders' Representative, (ii)
Parent shall promptly deliver a number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
rounded up to the nearest whole number, equal to the quotient of (A) the
product of (1) the Final Merger Consideration Surplus _multiplied by_ (2) the
Closing Stock Consideration Percentage, _divided by_ (B) the Per Share Price,
and (iii) Parent shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the product of
(x) 100% minus the Closing Stock Consideration Percentage _multiplied by_ (y)
the Final Merger Consideration Surplus to the account(s) specified by the
Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(h) The procedures set forth in this _Section 2.05_ for resolving any
dispute over the amounts contemplated to be determined as set forth in this
_Section 2.05_ shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
dispute over such amounts, it being understood that the foregoing shall not
limit Parent's rights under _Article XI_.

  



  

(i) The fees and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be allocated
among the Parent and the Stockholders' Representative based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the presentation to
the Reviewing Accountant. For example, if the Stockholders' Representative
submits a Notice of Objection for $1,000, and if Parent contests only $500 of
the amount claimed by the Stockholders' Representative, and if the Reviewing
Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Stockholders'
Representative $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the
Reviewing Accountant will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ 300/500) to Parent
and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200/500) to the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of
the Company Stockholders).

with respect to any amounts required to be treated as interest pursuant to
Section 483 of the Code).

  



  

Section 2.06 _ Designated Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the Parent
Board shall take all action necessary to ensure that, effective as of
the Closing, Brian Miller and Doug Schillinger (each, a " _Designated
Director_ ") shall be appointed to the Parent Board. The Company represents
and warrants that Brian Miller meets the applicable criteria to qualify as an
independent director of Parent, pursuant to the rules of NASDAQ.

(a) As additional consideration for the Merger, within ten (10) Business Days
after the occurrence of a Triggering Event (or, in the case of a Triggering
Event that occurs prior to the Closing Date, within ten (10) Business Days
after the Closing Date), Parent shall issue or cause to be issued to the
Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Applicable Earnout Share
Number in respect of such Triggering Event (such issued shares of Parent
Common Stock, collectively, the " _Earnout Shares_ ").

  



  

(b) Any issuance of Earnout Shares shall be treated as an adjustment to the
purchase price for all Tax purposes, except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
amounts required to be treated as interest pursuant to Section 483 of the
Code).

Section 3.06 _ Effect of the Mergers on the Company Preferred Stock and
Company Common Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II, the Company, the Company Stockholders or the holders of any of the
securities of Parent, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) Each share of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to
represent the right to receive its Pro Rata Share of the Total Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of the Certificate(s) representing such share
of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable. As of the
First Effective Time, each Company Stockholder shall cease to have any other
rights in and to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and each Certificate
relating to the ownership of shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration.

  



  

(b) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of
the First Merger, and each Company Stockholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by such Company Stockholder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of such
fractional share, an amount of cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Stockholder
would have been entitled but for this _Section 3.06(b)_,  _multiplied by_
(ii) $10.

  



  

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub I shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the First Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub I shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(d) Each share of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock held in
the Company's treasury or owned by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the
Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, together with
each share of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock described in
the next sentence, an " _Excluded Share_ "), shall be cancelled and no
consideration shall be paid or payable with respect thereto. Each share of
Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II) or of the
Company shall be converted into a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such
Subsidiary would be entitled to receive not taking into account this _Section
3.06(d)_ and (y) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
quotient of the amount of cash that such Subsidiary would be entitled to
receive not taking into account this  _Section 3.06(d)_, _divided by_ , the
Closing Share Price.

  



  

(e) The numbers of shares of Parent Common Stock that the Company
Stockholders are entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger and as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing.

Section 3.07 _ Certificates_.

  



  

(a) From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Preferred
Stock or Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time. If, after the First Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and deemed exchanged for (without interest and after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings as provided in this Agreement) the
portion of the Total Consideration represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(b) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed: (i) upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed; and (ii) if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
Parent will issue the portion of the Total Consideration attributable to such
Certificate (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in this Agreement).

  



  

Section 3.08 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the First Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation following the First Merger, or the Surviving LLC following the
Second Merger, with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II, the officers and directors (or their designees) of the
Company, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.09 _ Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Closing Stock Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change.

  



  

Section 3.10 _ Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving LLC, the Escrow Agent and any other applicable
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Person is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code
or any other provision of applicable Tax Law; _provided_ that so long as the
FIRPTA Certificates and Forms W-9 described in _Section 7.10_ are timely
received by Parent, the Parties acknowledge that as of the date hereof (and
based on the provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder as in effect on the date hereof), no U.S. federal income tax
withholding shall be required with respect to the payment of the Closing
Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Mergers; _provided_ , _further_ that if Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving LLC
determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld (other than
any withholding required resulting from (x) the Company's or any Company
Stockholder's failure to deliver or timely update a FIRPTA Certificate or a
Form W-9 or (y) any compensatory payment made hereunder), at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled to be
made, Parent shall provide the Stockholders' Representative with written
notice of the intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the
calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax law pursuant to
which such deduction and withholding is required and provide the recipient of
such payment a reasonable opportunity for such recipient to provide forms or
other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid or remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each entity classification

Section 6.06  _SEC Filings and Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or furnished
by Parent with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
Parent's incorporation to the date of this Agreement, together with any
amendments, restatements or supplements thereto (all of the foregoing filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "), and will
have filed all such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date (the " _Additional Parent SEC Reports_ "). All Parent SEC
Reports, Additional Parent SEC Reports, any correspondence from or to the SEC
or NASDAQ (other than such correspondence in connection with the initial
public offering of Parent) and all certifications and statements required by:
(i) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act; or (ii) 18 U.S.C. § 1350
(Section 906) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Certifications_ ") are available on the SEC's
Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR) in full
without redaction. Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company true and
correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed by
Parent with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC and are currently in effect.
The Parent SEC Reports were, and the Additional Parent SEC Reports will be,
prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Parent SEC Reports did not,
and the Additional Parent SEC Reports will not, at the time they were or are
filed, as the case may be, with the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Certifications
are each true and correct. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Each director
and executive officer of Parent has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
statements required with respect to Parent by Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

  



  

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present, and the financial statements and
notes to be contained in or to be incorporated by reference in the Additional
Parent SEC Reports will fairly present, the financial condition and the
results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows of
Parent as at the respective dates of, and for the periods referred to, in
such financial statements, all in accordance with: (i) GAAP; and (ii)
Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in the case of
interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the
effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and
the omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation
S-K, as applicable. Parent has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those
of Parent are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent.

Section 6.07  _Parent Trust Amount_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Parent Trust Amount is approximately $460,060,132.27.

  



  

Section 6.08  _PIPE Investment Amount_. Parent has delivered to the Company
accurate and complete copies of each of the Subscription Agreements entered
into by Parent with the applicable investors named therein (collectively, the
" _PIPE Investors_ "), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to
provide equity financing to Parent in the aggregate amount of
$350,000,000 (the " _PIPE Investment Amount_ "). As of the Closing Date,
assuming (a) the funding of the full amount of the PIPE Investment Amount in
accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions of the
Subscription Agreements, (b) the accuracy in all material respects of the
Company's and the Stockholders' Representative's representations
and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ of this Agreement
and compliance in all material respects by the Company with its covenants,
agreements and obligations under _Article VII_ of this Agreement, and (c)
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 8.03(f)_, the aggregate
amount of Available Cash will be sufficient to enable Parent to pay all cash
amounts required to be paid by Parent under or in connection with this
Agreement. To Parent's Knowledge, with respect to each PIPE Investor as of
the date hereof, the Subscription Agreements are in full force and effect and
have not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in
any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is
contemplated by Parent. Each Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to Parent's Knowledge, each PIPE Investor.
Neither the execution nor delivery by Parent, or, to Parent's Knowledge, any
other party thereto, of, nor the performance of Parent's, or, to Parent's
Knowledge, any other party's obligations under, such Subscription Agreement
violates any applicable Laws. There are no other agreements, side letters, or
arrangements between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any
Subscription Agreement that would affect the obligation of the PIPE Investors
to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount
set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and, as of the date hereof,
Parent does not know of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any Subscription
Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment Amount not being
available to Parent, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under any material term or condition of any Subscription
Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any term
or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription
Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent
(other than the conditions contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to
the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable
portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements
on the terms therein. No fees, consideration or other discounts are payable
or have been agreed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, from and
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to any PIPE Investor in
respect of its PIPE Investment, except as set forth in the
Subscription Agreements.

Section 6.09 _Brokerage_. Other than fees or commissions for which Parent
will be solely responsible, there are no claims for, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries have no liability or obligation to pay, brokerage
commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements based
on any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable.

  



  

Section 6.10  _Investment Company_. Parent is not an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

  



  

Section 6.11  _Business Activities_. Since its organization, other than as
described in the Parent SEC Reports, Parent has not conducted any material
business activities other than activities directed toward the accomplishment
of a Business Combination. Except as set forth in the Buyer Governing
Documents, there is no Contract or Actions binding upon Parent or to which
Parent is a party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of Parent or any
acquisition of property by Parent or the conduct of business by the Parent
after Closing, other than such effects, individually or in the
aggregate, which are not, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
material to the Parent.

  



  

Section 6.12  _Parent Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders of Parent or at the time of
the Parent Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to: (a) statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
the Company or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement; or (b) any projections or forecasts included in the
Proxy Statement.

  



  

Section 6.13  _Taxes_ 

  



  

(a) Parent has not taken any action, and is not aware of any fact or
circumstance (without conducting independent inquiry or diligence of any
other relevant party), that would reasonably be expected to prevent the First
Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, from constituting an integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(b) All of the membership interests in Merger Sub II are owned by Parent, and
Merger Sub II is, and has been since formation, disregarded as an entity
(within the meaning of Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations)
separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any

consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be
expected to (i) impose a material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the
risk of not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization,
declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting

to receive such confidential competitively sensitive information on an
external counsel only basis. The Parties shall: (i) not agree to an extension

information specified in Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Transactions and, to the extent required, the Designated Directors (the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary form. Parent shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable notify the Company of the receipt of any oral or
written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and any request
by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and

comments of the SEC and give due consideration to all comments reasonably
proposed by the Company in respect of such documents and responses prior to
filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the Parties will

promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Parent will cause the Proxy Statement to be transmitted to the Parent
Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable.

its Subsidiaries and their respective management and operations and financial
condition, in each case, required or reasonably requested by Parent to be

statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with SEC
Guidance, including the requirements of Regulation S-X and a related consent
from the Company's independent public accountants, (ii) required selected
financial data of the Company and its Subsidiaries required by Item 301 of
Regulation S-K, and (iii) required management's discussion and analysis for the
periods required under applicable SEC Guidance. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro forma financial statements that
comply with SEC Guidance, including the requirements of Regulation S-X. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make the managers, directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to
Parent and its counsel (and other Representatives engaged in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement) in connection with the drafting of
the Proxy Statement, as reasonably requested by Parent, and responding in a
timely manner to comments on the Proxy Statement and such other filings from
the SEC.

  



  

(c) Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and the
Organizational Documents of Parent, all action necessary to call, hold and
convene an extraordinary general meeting of Parent (including any permitted
adjournment) (the " _Parent Special Meeting_ ") to consider and vote upon the
Parent Stockholder Proposals as promptly as practicable after the filing of
the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the SEC. Once the Parent Special
Meeting to consider and vote upon the Parent Stockholder Proposals has been
called and noticed, except as required by Law, Parent will not postpone or
adjourn the Parent Special Meeting without the consent of the Company (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other than
(i) for the absence of a quorum, or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that
Parent has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal advisors, is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Parent
Stockholders prior to the Parent Special Meeting, or (iii) an adjournment or
postponement to solicit additional proxies from the Parent Stockholders to
the extent Parent has determined in good faith that such adjournment or
postponement is reasonably necessary to obtain the approval of the Parent
Stockholder Proposals, _provided_  that, in the case of an postponement or
adjournment in accordance with _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , above, such
postponement or adjournment (A) may be no more than ten (10) Business Days
from the original date of the Parent Special Meeting and (B) for the
avoidance of doubt shall not require the consent of the Company. Subject to
_Section 7.07(d)_, following delivery of the Proxy Statement to the Parent
Stockholders, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to solicit approval of
the Parent Stockholders Proposals by the Parent Stockholders.

(d) Subject to this _Section 7.07(d)_ , the Parent Board will recommend that
the Parent Stockholders approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals (the "
_Parent Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals, the Parent
Board may fail to make, amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or qualify
the Parent Board Recommendation (any such action a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the Parent Board shall have concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial advisors,
that a Change in Recommendation is required under applicable Law. Parent
agrees that, unless the Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
its obligation to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Special Meeting for the purpose of voting on the
Parent Stockholder Proposals shall not be affected by any Change in
Recommendation, and Parent agrees to establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Special Meeting and submit for
the approval of the Parent Stockholders the matters contemplated by the Proxy
Statement, regardless of whether or not there shall be any Change in
Recommendation.

information relating to Parent or the Company, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors or
other Representatives should be discovered by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, that in the reasonable judgment of Parent should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed as promptly as reasonably practicable with the SEC by Parent and
disseminated to the holders of the Parent Common Stock;  _provided_ that no
information received by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.07(e)_ shall be
deemed to change, supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(f) Subject to this _Section 7.07_, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to complete the Offer as promptly as practicable and shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the valid
termination of this Agreement. Parent shall extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC,
NASDAQ or the respective staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer.
Nothing in this _Section 7.07(f)_ shall (i) impose any obligation on

impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to
terminate this Agreement in accordance its terms.

Section 7.09  _Subscription Agreements_. Parent shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or any replacements of, the Subscription Agreements in a manner
materially adverse to the Company. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and
conditions described therein, including maintaining in effect the
Subscription Agreements and using its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and
covenants applicable to Parent in the Subscription Agreements; (ii) in the
event that all conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied, consummate transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements
at or prior to Closing; and (iii) enforce its rights under the Subscription
Agreements in the event that all conditions in the Subscription
Agreements (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied to cause the applicable PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements at or prior to the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give
the Stockholders' Representative prompt written notice: (A) of any amendment
to any Subscription Agreement (together with a copy of such amendment) and (B)
of any breach or default by any party to any Subscription Agreement known to
Parent. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the
applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the
Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.

Section 7.10 _FIRPTA Certificates; Forms W-9_. The Company and each Company
Stockholder shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing, a statement that
such Person is not a "foreign person" for purposes of Section 1445 of the Code
(such statement, a " _FIRPTA Certificate_ "). Prior to the Closing, the
Company and each Company Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a properly
completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (the " _Forms W-9_
"). It is agreed and understood that in no event shall the Company's or any
Company Stockholder's failure to provide a FIRPTA Certificate or a Form W-9 be
deemed to be a failure of any condition in this Agreement to have been met
and the sole remedy of any such failure shall be to withhold Taxes under
_Section 3.10_ of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.11 _No Claim Against the Parent Trust_. The Company and the
Stockholders' Representative acknowledge that they have read the Prospectus
and that Parent has established the Parent Trust from the proceeds of its
September 2020 initial public offering (" _IPO_ ") and from certain private
placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO for the benefit of Parent's
holders of Public Shares (" _Public Stockholders_ ") and certain parties
(including the underwriters of the IPO) and that, except for a portion of the
interest earned on the amounts held in the Parent Trust, Parent may disburse
monies from the Parent Trust only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event
they elect to redeem shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of Parent's initial business combination (as such term is used
in the Prospectus) (the " _Business Combination_ "); (b) to the Public
Stockholders if Parent fails to consummate a Business Combination within
twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the IPO; (c) any amounts
necessary to pay any Taxes; or (d) to, or on behalf of, Parent after or
concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company and
Stockholders' Representative hereby agree that they do not now and shall not
at any time hereafter have (other than their rights upon Closing) any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Parent Trust
or distributions therefrom, or make any claim prior to Closing against the
Parent Trust, regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ "). The Company and
Stockholders' Representative hereby irrevocably waive any Claims they may
have, against the Parent Trust (including any distributions therefrom) now or
in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with Parent and will not, prior to the Closing, seek recourse
against the Parent Trust (including any distributions therefrom) for any
reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement). For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the waivers under this _Section 7.11_ will continue to apply at and
after the Closing or termination of this Agreement (as applicable) to
distributions made to redeeming Public Stockholders and for
transaction expenses paid (including deferred IPO underwriting discount and
expenses payable to Parent's underwriters in connection with the IPO). The
Company and Stockholders' Representative agree and acknowledge that such
irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon
by Parent to induce it to enter into this Agreement. This _Section
7.11_ shall not limit the Company's or the Stockholders' Representative's
right to seek specific performance against Parent pursuant to _Section
11.13_, including the right to seek specific performance against Parent
to require Parent to take such actions contemplated by this Agreement subject
to the satisfaction of Parent's conditions to the Closing in _Section 8.01_
and _Section 8.03_, and to comply with the terms of the Parent
Trust Agreement, including distribution of funds from the Parent Trust upon
the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.12 _280G_. The Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to
obtain a waiver from each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) that shall provide that, if the requisite
stockholder approval under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code is not obtained,
no payments or benefits that would separately or in the aggregate constitute
"excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
with respect to such disqualified individual in the absence of such
stockholder approval shall be payable to or retained by such disqualified
individual to the extent such excess parachute payments would not be
deductible by reason of the application of Section 280G of the Code or would
result in the imposition of excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code upon
such disqualified individual, and (ii) deliver to the Company's stockholders
a disclosure statement that satisfies the disclosure obligations under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and solicit the approval of the Company's
stockholders under Section 280G(b)(5)(B). Neither the Company nor any of the
Company's Subsidiaries shall make any such excess parachute payments that are
not so approved. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the form of
such waiver, such disclosure statement, and the stockholder written consent
for Parent's review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, no less than three (3) days prior to delivery to each
such disqualified individual and the Company's stockholders, respectively.
Within two (2) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, with
respect to each "disqualified individual" of the Company, the Company shall
provide to Parent a customary Section 280G analysis prepared by or on behalf
of the Company that includes the Company's good faith estimate of all payments
and benefits that could be provided to such disqualified individual as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event) and such disqualified individual's "base
amount" as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code. If requested by Parent
not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall update such analysis to reflect the impact of the payments and benefits
to be provided by Parent pursuant to any agreement entered into
between Parent and a disqualified individual.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Board,
or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
issuance of Parent Common Stock by Parent, in each case, pursuant to this
Agreement to any officer, director or shareholder (by reason of "director by
deputization") of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is expected to become
a "covered person" of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  



  

Section 7.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate with the other and use reasonable best efforts in the defense or
settlement of any Action relating to the Transactions which is brought or
threatened in writing against (a) Parent, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any
of their respective directors or officers, or (b) the Company any of its
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors or officers. Such
cooperation between the Parties shall include (i) keeping the other Party
reasonably and promptly informed of any developments in connection with any
such Action, and (ii) utilizing counsel reasonably agreeable to the Parties
(such agreement to counsel not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and (iii) refraining from compromising, settling, consenting to
any order or entering into any agreement in respect of, any such Action
without the written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) If the Closing occurs, Parent shall cause all rights to indemnification
and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any employee, officer,
director, managing member, manager, Affiliate and agent of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case that is an individual (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to survive the consummation of the Transactions
and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Company and its

affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.18_ applies without the
consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.18_ applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.18_). If the Closing occurs, Parent
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay all expenses to any
Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other
obligations provided for in this _Section 7.18_.

  



  

(b) In the event Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets or stock or other equity interests to any Person, then

made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be (or their respective successors and

will Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC) be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for

Agreement at any time prior to the Closing by written notice to Parent:

  



  

(a) upon a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary

satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ incapable of
fulfillment, and such violation or breach has neither been waived by the
Company nor cured by Parent within thirty (30) days of Parent's receipt of
written notice of such violation or breach from the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

Stockholders' Representative is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements; or

  



  

(b) if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred by June 8, 2021 (the "
_Termination Date_ "), _provided_ , that the Termination Date may be extended
(A) to a later date by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company or (B)

which case such later date determined in accordance with _clause (A)_ or

of the Ancillary Agreements that are required to be performed or complied
with at or prior to Closing.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Termination by Parent_. Parent may terminate this Agreement at

parties under Section 368(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and (y)

after the Mergers, if such fact, circumstance or action would be reasonably
expected to cause the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify for the
Intended Tax Treatment. The Mergers, taken together, shall be reported by the
Parties for all Tax purposes in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment,
including the filing of the statement required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-3, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a final

Representative is and shall be authorized by each Company Stockholder to act,
or refrain from acting, with respect to any actions to be taken by or on
behalf of any Company Stockholder or the Stockholders' Representative,
including to enforce any rights granted to any Company Stockholder hereunder,
in each case as the Stockholders' Representative believes is necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, for and on
behalf of the Company Stockholders. The Company Stockholders shall be bound
by all such actions taken by the Stockholders' Representative and no Company
Stockholder shall be permitted to take any such actions. The Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable to the Company Stockholders for any error
of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, in
connection with the performance by the Stockholders' Representative of the
Stockholders' Representative's duties or the exercise by the Stockholders'
Representative of the Stockholders' Representative's rights and remedies under
this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, except in the case of its bad
faith or willful misconduct. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders' Representative may consult
with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected
by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or experts. The Stockholders' Representative shall not have any duty to
ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the
terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders'
Representative shall have the full power and authority to interpret all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to
consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all Company
Stockholders and their respective successors. Parent shall be entitled to rely

Stockholders' Representative from and against any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities (" _Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with
the Stockholders' Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in each case as such Loss is suffered
or incurred; _provided_  that in the event that any such Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the willful misconduct of
the Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders' Representative will
reimburse the Company Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Loss to the
extent attributable to such willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Company Stockholders
for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in such capacity. In no event
will the Stockholders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Company Stockholders or otherwise. The Company Stockholders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.

Stockholders and the Stockholders' Representative will indemnify and hold
harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses

accordingly agree that each Party, in addition to any other remedy to which
it may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or similar equitable relief restraining such Party from committing
or continuing any such breach or threatened breach or to seek to compel
specific performance of the obligations of any other Party under this
Agreement, without the posting of any bond, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any State
thereof having jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the Parties shall
raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. No remedy shall be
exclusive of any other remedy, and all available remedies shall be
cumulative.

business combination, each share of Class B Common Stock outstanding

Certificate shall automatically be converted into one share of Class A Common

Corporation, and concurrently with such conversion, the number of authorized
shares of Class B Common Stock shall be reduced to zero.

  



  

 _Section 4.3_ _Preferred Stock_. The Preferred Stock may be issued from
time to time in one or more series. The Board is hereby expressly
authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of the Preferred Stock in
one or more series and to establish from time to time the number of shares to

designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional,
special and other rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series
and included in a certificate of designation (a " _Preferred Stock
Designation_ ") filed pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly
vested with the authority to the full extent now or hereafter provided by law
to adopt any such resolution or resolutions.

  



  

 _Section 4.4_   _Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the
Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of
directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one
vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the
stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote
on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including
any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the
terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation) or the DGCL.

(b) Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series
of the Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive such dividends and other distributions (payable in cash, property or
capital stock of the Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the
Board from time to time out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor, and shall share equally on a per share basis in such
dividends and distributions.

  



  

(c) Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series
of the Preferred Stock, in the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, after
payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the
Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all
the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of the Common
Stock held by them.

  



  

 _Section 4.5_ _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to
create and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof
to purchase shares of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock
or other securities of the Corporation, and such rights, warrants and options
shall be evidenced by instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is
empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other
terms and conditions of such rights, warrants or options; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the consideration to be received for any shares of capital
stock subject thereto may not be less than the par value thereof.

  



  

 _Section 4.6_   _No Class Vote on Changes in Authorized Number of Shares of
Stock_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of
Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any class or classes of
stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares
thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
the voting power of the stock entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

  



  

Article V 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

 _Section 5.1_ _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Amended and Restated By Laws
of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), the Board is hereby empowered to
exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the
DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

  

 _Section 5.2_ _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to
time exclusively by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority
of the Board.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial
Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II
Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at
the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each
succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning
with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate,
each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term
expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or
until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office,
subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section
5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease
shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the
number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case
shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent
director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of
Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors
pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election
of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by
resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in
office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in
accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

  



  

 _Section 5.3_ _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase
in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may
be filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director
(and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for
the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which the new
directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

  

 _Section 5.4_ _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of
the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and
only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class.

  



  

 _Section 5.5_ _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_, and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation)
and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created
pursuant to this _Article V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

  



  

Article VI 
 BYLAWS

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject
to any limitations contained in this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate, the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter and repeal the
Bylaws, but any Bylaws adopted by the Board may be adopted, amended, altered
or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation),
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , however,
that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any
prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been
adopted.

  



  

Article VII 
 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

  



  

 _Section 7.1_ _Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of
any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be
called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is
hereby specifically denied.

  



  

 _Section 7.2_ _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations
for the election of directors and of business to be brought by
stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

  

 _Section 7.3_ _Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or permitted
to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly
called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected
by written consent of the stockholders.

  



  

Article VIII 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

 _Section 8.1_ _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.
Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

 _Section 8.2_   _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify, defend, advance
expenses and hold harmless each person who is or was made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit, investigation, arbitration or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action
by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor
(each, a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person
for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability
and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees and disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, damages,
claims and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by
such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to
the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending or
otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition
(including by making any payment directly to the applicable third parties if
requested by the indemnitee); _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent
required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final
disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this
_Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses (which are, for the avoidance of doubt, indemnified proceedings
and expenses), the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was, or is,
authorized by the Board.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to
the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when
such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of,
or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. If the DGCL is amended
after the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to
authorize corporation action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
as so amended.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

Article IX 
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

 _Section 9.1_ __The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other
analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of
its officers or directors in circumstances where the application of any such
doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict with any fiduciary duties
or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the
doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate
opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the
Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such
person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and
contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the
Corporation to pursue.

  



   

7

 



    

  



  

 _Section 9.2_ __Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, each of BLS Investor Group LLC, Linden Manager III LP, DW
Management Services, L.L.C. and the investment funds affiliated with the
foregoing and their respective successors and Affiliates (as defined in
_Section 10.3_) (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries) and all of
their respective partners, principals, directors, officers, members,
managers, equity holders and/or employees, including any of the foregoing who
serve as officers or directors of the Corporation (each, an " _Exempted
Person_ ") shall not have any fiduciary duty to refrain from engaging directly
or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business
as the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, except as otherwise expressly
provided in any agreement entered into between the Corporation and such
Exempted Person. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest
or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered
an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to
time available to the Exempted Persons, even if the opportunity is one that
the Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have
pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to
do so, and each such Exempted Person shall have no duty to communicate or
offer such business opportunity to the Corporation (and there shall be no
restriction on the Exempted Persons using the general knowledge and
understanding of the industry in which the Corporation operates which it has
gained as an Exempted Person in considering and pursuing such opportunities
or in making investment, voting, monitoring, governance or other decisions
relating to other entities or securities) and, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or stockholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a
director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Exempted
Person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business

subsidiaries, or uses such knowledge and understanding in the manner described
herein, in each case, except as otherwise expressly provided in any agreement
entered into between the Corporation and such Exempted Person. In addition to

of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of this
_Article IX_.

inconsistent with this _Article IX_, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of
this _Article IX_ in respect of any business opportunity first identified or
any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but
for this _Article IX_, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This _Article IX_ shall not limit
any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement
rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to 10 or more persons; or

  



  

(iii) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or

States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the
exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. If any action the subject matter of which
is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is
filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "

Article II 
 STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

  



  

Section 2.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and time and
on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice of
the meeting; _provided_ that the Board may in its sole discretion determine
that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_. At
each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters shall
elect those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship
that expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact any other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
outstanding series of the preferred stock of the Corporation (the "
_Preferred Stock_ "), and to the requirements of applicable law, special
meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant
to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and may not be called by
any other person. Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such

Section 2.3 Notices. Written notice of each stockholders meeting stating the
place, if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting and the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is
different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to

of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). If said notice is for a stockholders meeting
other than an annual meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business transacted at such
meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation's notice
of meeting (or any supplement thereto). Any meeting of stockholders as to

Section 2.4 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
the same may be amended or restated from time to time (the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") or these By Laws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at a
stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of
the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting,
except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of
stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall
constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such
business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting
may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in _Section
2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened
meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of
its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a
majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for
quorum purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 2.5 Voting of Shares.

  



  

(a) _Voting Lists_. The Secretary of the Corporation (the " _Secretary_ ")
shall prepare, or shall cause the officer or agent who has charge of the
stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare, at least 10 days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record
entitled to vote at such meeting and showing the address and the number and
class of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained
in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall require the Corporation to include electronic
mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane
to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10
days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network;
_provided_ that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of the meeting; or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event
that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic
network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such
information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. If a meeting of stockholders is
to be held solely by means of remote communication as permitted by _Section
9.5(a)_, the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to examine the list required by this _Section
2.5(a)_ or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote
communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic
transmission (as defined in _Section 9.3_); _provided_ that any such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in
its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such
person's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be
cast by written ballot.

  



  

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Proxies need not be
filed with the Secretary until the meeting is called to order, but shall be
filed with the Secretary before being voted. Without limiting the manner in
which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means
by which a stockholder may grant such authority. No stockholder shall have
cumulative voting rights.

  



  

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

  



  

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission;  _provided_ that any such electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; _provided_ that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of the Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at
all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of
directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a
majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the
matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, these By Laws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different
vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the
decision of such matter.

  



  

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. The Board may, and shall if required by law, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as
inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise
serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace
any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or
alternates are appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before
discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the
number of outstanding shares and the voting power of each; determine the
number of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report
the results; determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and
certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the
meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. No person who is a candidate
for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each
report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by
a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.
If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the
report of the inspectors.

  



  

Section 2.6 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may
be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or
not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place,

the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in
accordance with _Section 9.2_ , and shall give notice of the adjourned
meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned
meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
given by or at the direction of the Board; (ii) otherwise properly brought
before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board; or (iii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the
Corporation: (A) who is a stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
annual meeting on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this
_Section 2.7(a) _and on the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting; and (B) who complies
with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.7(a) _to the contrary, only
persons nominated for election as a director to fill any term of a
directorship that expires on the date of the annual meeting pursuant to
_Section 3.2_ will be considered for election at such meeting.

  



  

(i) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other
than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper
written form to the Secretary and such business must otherwise be a proper
matter for stockholder action. Subject to _Section 2.7(a)(iii_), a
stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to such business, to be
timely, must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th
day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the
anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the annual meeting is more
than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than
the close of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than
the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting, or if the first
public announcement of the date of the meeting is less than 100 days prior to
the date of the meeting, the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first
made by the Corporation. The public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described
in this _Section 2.7(a)_. In addition, to be considered timely, a
stockholder's notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary,
so that the information provided or required to be provided in such
notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as
of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for
the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as
of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the
date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of
the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation to update and supplement as set forth in
this paragraph or any other Section of these By Laws shall not limit
the Corporation's rights with respect to any deficiencies in any notice
provided by a stockholder, extend any applicable deadlines hereunder or
enable or be deemed to permit a stockholder who has previously submitted
notice hereunder to amend or update any proposal or to submit any new
proposal, including by changing or adding nominees, matters, business and or
resolutions proposed to be brought before a meeting of the stockholders.

such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit
proxies for such annual meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual
meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_; _provided_
,  _however_ , that once business has been properly brought before the annual

business. If the Board or the chairman of the annual meeting determines that
any stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 2.7(a)_ or that the information provided in a stockholder's
notice does not satisfy the information requirements of this _Section
2.7(a)_, such proposal shall not be presented for action at the annual
meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_,
if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does
not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present
the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted,

made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in proper written form to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice

offices of the Corporation: (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not later
than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day before the anniversary date of the immediately
preceding annual meeting of stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60
days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must
be so received not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before

a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing
directors, not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of the special meeting is first
made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or special meeting commence a
new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's
notice as described in this _Section 3.2_. In addition, to be considered
timely, a stockholder's notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if
necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in
such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting
and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be

avoidance of doubt, the obligation to update and supplement as set forth in
this paragraph or any other Section of these By Laws shall not limit the
Corporation's rights with respect to any deficiencies in any notice provided
by a stockholder, extend any applicable deadlines hereunder or enable or be
deemed to permit a stockholder who has previously submitted notice hereunder
to amend or update any proposal or to submit any new proposal, including by
changing or adding nominees, matters, business and or resolutions proposed to
be brought before a meeting of the stockholders.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) to the contrary, in the event
that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting
is greater than the number of directors whose terms expire on the date of the
annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming
all of the nominees for the additional directors to be elected or specifying
the size of the increased Board before the close of business on the 100th day
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders, a stockholder's notice required by this _Section 3.2_ shall
also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships created by such increase that are to be filled by
election at such annual meeting, if it shall be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the
close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such public

(e) With respect to each individual, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to
nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, a
stockholder's notice must, in addition to the matters set forth in paragraphs
(d) above, also include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation
and agreement required by _Section 3.2(h)_ of these By Laws. The Corporation
may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may
reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of
such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation
or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the
independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in these By Laws, including without limitation this
_Section 3.2_ , shall be eligible for election as directors.

  



  

(f) If the Board or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders determines
that any nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 3.2_ or that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does
not satisfy the information requirements of this _Section 3.2_, then such
nomination shall not be considered at the meeting in question.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.2_, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not
appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the
nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such nomination may have been received by the
Corporation.

  



  

(g) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 3.2_, a stockholder shall
also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this _Section 3.2 _shall be deemed to affect any rights
of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the
Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(h) To be eligible to be a nominee of any stockholder for election or

offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the
background and qualification of such individual and the background of any
other person or entity on whose behalf, directly or indirectly, the nomination
is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon
written request), and a written representation and agreement (in the form
provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such individual (A) is
not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement, arrangement or

individual's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation,
with such individual's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) is not and

any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or
indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with
service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, (C) in

to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class,
the Corporation shall: (a) cause the powers, designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of
stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of

including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services
to be performed or other securities, or any combination thereof.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, shares

been set forth the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and
the amount paid thereon up to and including the time said

Section 7.5 Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates.

  



  

(a) If an owner of a certificate representing shares claims that such
certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the

certificate before the Corporation has notice that the certificate
representing such shares has been acquired by a protected purchaser; (ii) if
requested by the Corporation, delivers to the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the

Corporation.

apparent destruction or wrongful taking and the Corporation registers a
transfer of such shares before receiving notification, the owner shall be
precluded from asserting against the Corporation any claim for registering
such transfer or a claim to a new certificate representing such shares or such
shares in uncertificated form.

  



  

Section 7.6 Transfer of Stock.

  



  

(a) If a certificate representing shares of the Corporation is presented to
the Corporation with an endorsement requesting the registration of transfer
of such shares or an instruction is presented to the Corporation requesting
the registration of transfer of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall
register the transfer as requested if:

  



  

(i) in the case of certificated shares, the certificate representing such
shares has been surrendered; (A) with respect to certificated shares, the
endorsement is made by the person specified by the certificate as entitled to
such shares; (B) with respect to uncertificated shares, an instruction is
made by the registered owner of such uncertificated shares; or (C)
with respect to certificated shares or uncertificated shares, the endorsement
or instruction is made by any other appropriate person or by an agent who has
actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person;

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(ii) the Corporation has received a guarantee of signature of the person
signing such endorsement or instruction or such other reasonable assurance
that the endorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized as the
Corporation may request;

  



  

(iii) the transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer imposed by
the Corporation that is enforceable in accordance with _Section 7.8(a)_; and

  



  

(iv) such other conditions for such transfer as shall be provided for under
applicable law have been satisfied.

  



  

(b) Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and
not absolutely, the Corporation shall so record such fact in the entry of
transfer if, when the certificate for such shares is presented to the
Corporation for transfer or, if such shares are uncertificated, when the
instruction for registration of transfer thereof is presented to the
Corporation, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do
so.

  



  

Section 7.7 Registered Stockholders. Before due presentment for registration
of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the Corporation or of an
instruction requesting registration of transfer of uncertificated shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled
to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger and the other books and
records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all the
rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who is
the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence of
beneficial ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as
are provided under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records
of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.8 Effect of the Corporation's Restriction on Transfer.

  



  

(a) A written restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of
shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that
may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by the DGCL and
noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice, offering circular or
prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares
within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such
shares, may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

  



  

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are
uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering
circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of
such shares within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or
transfer of such shares.

agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that

Article VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 Right to Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of
the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other
enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (an " _Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in _Section 8.3_ with
respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation
shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 8.2 Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 8.1_, an Indemnitee shall also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited
by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement of
expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the DGCL requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the
Corporation's receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "),
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 8.3 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days
after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in
the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the
applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by
the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a
suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal
(hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that, the Indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement
of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this _Article VIII _or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other right,
which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.5 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.6 Indemnification of Other Persons. This _Article VIII_ shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized
or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent
of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VIII_ with respect to the

Section 8.7 Amendments. Any repeal or amendment of this _Article VIII_ by
the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable
law, or the adoption of any other provision of these By Laws inconsistent with
this _Article VIII_, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto),
and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that amendments or repeals of this _Article VIII_ shall require
the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting
power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.8 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this _Article VIII_: (a)
references to "other enterprise" shall include any employee benefit plan; (b)

plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest
of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be
deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest of the
Corporation" for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.9 Contract Rights. The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors
and administrators.

of this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of
this _Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the

Article IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.1 Place of Meetings. If the place of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these
By Laws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be
held at the principal business office of the Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a
meeting shall not be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of
remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting
shall not be held at any place.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

Section 9.2 Fixing Record Dates.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and
which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the
date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record
date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the
date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business
day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived,
at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section
9.2(a)_ at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9.3 Means of Giving Notice.

  



  

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any
director, such notice may be given: (i) in writing and sent either by hand
delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized
delivery service; (ii) by means of facsimile telecommunication or other form
of electronic transmission; or (iii) by oral notice given personally or by
telephone. A notice to a director will be deemed given as follows: (A) if
given by hand delivery, orally, or by telephone, when actually received by the
director; (B) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the
United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the
director at the director's address appearing on the records of the
Corporation; (C) if sent for by a nationally recognized delivery service,
when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the
director at the director's address appearing on the records of the
Corporation; (D) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the
facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of
the Corporation; (E) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic
mail address for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation; or
(F) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the
address, location or number (as applicable) for such director appearing on
the records of the Corporation.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(b) _Notice to Stockholders_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any
stockholder, such notice may be given: (i) in writing and sent either by hand
delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized
delivery service; or (ii) by means of a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the stockholder, to the extent permitted by, and subject to
the conditions set forth in Section 232 of the DGCL. A notice to a
stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (A) if given by hand delivery,
when actually received by the stockholder; (B) if sent through the United
States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees
thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address
appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation; (C) if sent for delivery by
a nationally recognized delivery service, when deposited with such service,
with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's
address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation; and (D) if given by
a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given and otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above: (1)
if by facsimile transmission, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network
together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specified posting,
upon the later of: (x) such posting; and (y) the giving of such separate
notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when
directed to the stockholder. A stockholder may revoke such
stockholder's consent to receiving notice by means of electronic
communication by giving written notice of such revocation to the
Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (x) the Corporation
is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given
by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and (y) such inability
becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the
Corporation's transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of
notice;  _provided_ , _however_ , the inadvertent failure to treat such
inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

  



  

(c) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process, including but not limited to
transmission by telex, facsimile telecommunication, electronic mail, telegram
and cablegram.

  



  

(d) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws
shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who
share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom
such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(e) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that
the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given
to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with
whom communication is unlawful.

  



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any stockholder to whom: (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings to such stockholder
during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings; or (2) all,
and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or
interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed
addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown on the
records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving
of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or
meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall
have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any
such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting
forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement that notice be
given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action
taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that
notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given
pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection (1) of
the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be given
shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice
was given by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 9.4 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By Laws, a
written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to
said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to such required notice. All such waivers shall be kept with the
books of the Corporation. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except where a person attends for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that
the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.5 Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.

  



  

(a) _Stockholder Meetings_. If authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board
may adopt, stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and proxy holders
not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote
communication:

  



  

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means
of remote communication; _provided_ that: (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxy holder; (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and, if entitled to vote, to vote on matters
submitted to the applicable stockholders, including an opportunity to read or
hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such
proceedings; and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other
action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such
votes or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the
meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground
that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.6 Dividends. The Board may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the
Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of
capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of
Incorporation.

  



  

Section 9.7 Reserves. The Board may set apart out of the funds of the
Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper
purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

  



  

Section 9.8 Contracts and Negotiable Instruments. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By
Laws, any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be
executed and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such
officer or officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the
Board may from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or
confined to specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of
the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any
contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on
behalf of the Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board,
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to
execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other
instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or
employees of the Corporation under such person's supervision and authority,
it being understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not
relieve such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such
delegated power.

the Board.

  



  

   

27

be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as
may from time to time be designated by the Board.

  



  

Section 9.12 Resignation. Any director, committee member or officer may
resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the
Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time it is delivered
unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date
determined upon the happening of an event or events. Unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
to make it effective.

  



  

Section 9.13 Surety Bonds. Such officers, employees and agents of the
Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer,
President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the
faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control
belonging to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board
may determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and
the bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.

  



  

Section 9.14 Securities of Other Corporations. Powers of attorney, proxies,
waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other instruments
relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name of
and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer, President, any Vice President or any officers authorized by
the Board. Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the
Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security holders of any
corporation in which the Corporation may own securities, or to consent in
writing, in the name of the Corporation as such holder, to any action by such
corporation, and at any such meeting or with respect to any such consent
shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power incident to the
ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation
might have exercised and possessed. The Board may from time to time confer
like powers upon any other person or persons.

alter or repeal the By Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By Laws. The By Laws
also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable
law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least a majority of the voting power (except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.7_ ) of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation

 _FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT_

  



  

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
[●], by and among [●], a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), BLS Investor
Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Sponsor_ "), LCP Edge
Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Holdco_ ") and DW
Healthcare Partners IV (B), L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _DWHP_ "
and, together with Holdco, the " _Company Stockholders_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meaning ascribed to
such term in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 8, 2020,
by and among LCP Edge Intermediate, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Parent, Hydrate Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Merger Sub I_ "), Hydrate Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Merger Sub II_ ") and Holdco (as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "). The Company
Stockholders and any person or entity who hereafter becomes a party to this
Agreement pursuant to Section 1 are referred to herein, individually, as a "
_Holder_ " and, collectively, as the " _Holders_." Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in view of the valuable
consideration to be received by the parties thereunder, the parties desire to
enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which the Holders' Parent Common Stock
(the " _Restricted Securities_ ") shall become subject to limitations on
disposition as set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Lock-Up Provisions_.

  



  

(a) The Holders hereby agree not to, during the period commencing from the
Closing and through the earlier of (x) the one hundred and eightieth (180)
day anniversary of the date of the Closing and (y) the date after the Closing
on which Parent consummates a Change of Control (as defined below) (the "
_Lock-Up Period_ "): sell, transfer to another or otherwise dispose of, in
whole or in part, the Restricted Securities, whether any such transaction is
to be settled by delivery of Restricted Securities or other securities, in
cash or otherwise (any of the foregoing, a " _Prohibited Transfer_ "). The
foregoing sentence shall not apply to:

  



  

(A) the transfer of any or all of the Restricted Securities by a _bona fide_
gift or charitable contribution, on death by will or intestacy to a member of
such Holders' immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiaries of which are
exclusively the undersigned and/or a member or members of such Holders'
immediate family or an affiliate of such person or pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order;

  



  

(B) the transfer of any or all of the Restricted Securities to any Permitted
Transferee; or

  



  

(C) the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the
Exchange Act for the transfer of Restricted Securities;  _provided_ , that
such plan does not provide for the transfer of Restricted Securities during
the Lock-Up Period;

  



  

   



 



    



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that in any of cases (A) or (B), it shall be a
condition to such transfer that the transferee, if not a Company
Stockholder, enters into a written agreement with the Company agreeing to be
bound by the restrictions herein; _provided_ , _further_ , that in any of
cases (A) or (B) such transfer or distribution shall not involve a disposition
for value.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Change of Control_ " shall mean any
_bona fide_ third-party tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar
transaction the result of which is that (i) any "person" (as defined in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), or group of persons, other than the
Company, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of
the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of total voting power of the voting stock
of Parent or (ii) all of the Company's stockholders have the right to
exchange their shares of Parent Common Stock for cash, securities or other
property.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Permitted Transferee_ " shall mean:

  



  

(i) as a distribution to the direct or indirect general partners, limited
partners, shareholders, members of, stockholders, unitholders or owners of
similar equity interests in a Holder;

  



  

(ii) to any affiliate of a Company Stockholder or to any fund or other entity
controlled or managed by such entity or any of its affiliates, or to an
investment manager or investment advisor of a Company Stockholder or an
affiliate of any such investment manager or investment advisor; or

  



  

(iii) to a nominee or custodian of a person or entity to whom a distribution
or transfer would be permissible under (i) or (ii) above.

  



  

The Holders further agree to execute such agreements as may be reasonably
requested by Parent that are consistent with the foregoing or that are
necessary to give further effect thereto.

  



  

(b) If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the
provisions of this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be
null and void _ab initio_ , and Parent shall refuse to recognize any such
purported transferee of the Restricted Securities as one of its equity
holders for any purpose. In order to enforce this Section 1, Parent may impose
stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Restricted Securities (and
permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-
Up Period.

  



  

(c) During the Lock-Up Period, each certificate or book-entry position
evidencing any Restricted Securities shall be marked with a legend in
substantially the following form, in addition to any other applicable legends:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
SET FORTH IN A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF [●], BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER OF
SUCH SECURITIES AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF THE SHARES (OR THE PREDECESSOR IN
INTEREST TO THE SHARES). A COPY OF SUCH LOCK-UP AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED
WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST."

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, each Holder shall retain all of its rights as
a shareholder of Parent with respect to the Restricted Securities during the
Lock-Up Period, including the right to vote any Restricted Securities that are
entitled to vote.

  



  

2. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement and all
obligations of a Holder are personal to such Holder and may not be
transferred or delegated at any time.

  



  

(b) _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
to confer upon any person who is not a signatory hereto any rights or
benefits, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.

  



  

(c) _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware (without reference to its choice of law rules that would require the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction). Each party hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees that all claims or causes of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall only be brought in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state
court), or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction of such claim or
cause of action is vested in the federal courts, then the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, (b) expressly submits to the
personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purposes thereof, and
(c) waives and agrees not to raise (by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise) any and all jurisdictional, venue and convenience objections or
defenses that such party may have in such action or proceeding.

  



  

(d) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 2(d)_.

(e) _Interpretation_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are
for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires: (i) any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa; (ii)
"including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including without
limiting the generality of any description preceding or succeeding such term
and shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation"; (iii) the words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words
of similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or other
subdivision of this Agreement; and (iv) the term "or" means "and/or". The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision

(g) _Amendments and Waivers_. Only upon the approval by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of Parent then in office that qualify as
"independent" for purposes of audit committee membership under Section 10A-3
under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, compliance with any of the
provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived
by Parent, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended
or modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in
its capacity as a holder of Restricted Securities, shall require the consent
of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing between any Holder or
Parent and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on the part of a
Holder or Parent in exercising any rights or remedies under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any Holder or Parent.
No single or partial exercise of any rights or remedies under this Agreement
by a party shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise of any other
rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder by such party.

  



  

(h) _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

  



  

(i) _Specific Performance_. Each Holder acknowledges that its obligations
under this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of
a breach of this Agreement by such Holder, money damages will be inadequate
and Parent will have no adequate remedy at law, and agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by such Holder in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, Parent shall be entitled to
an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement by a
Holder and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
the requirement to post any bond or other security or to prove that money
damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or
remedy to which such party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in
equity.

  



  

(j) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject
matter hereof existing between the parties is expressly canceled; _provided_
, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not affect the rights
and obligations of the parties under the Merger Agreement or any documents
related thereto or referred to therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of the rights or
remedies of Parent or any of the obligations of any of the Holders under any
other agreement between any of the Holders and Parent or any certificate or
instrument executed by any of the Holders in favor of Parent, and nothing in
any other agreement, certificate or instrument shall limit any of the rights
or remedies of Parent or any of the obligations of any of the Holders under
this Agreement.

  



  

(k) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at another party's request and
without further consideration (but at the requesting party's reasonable cost
and expense), each party shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(l) _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may also be executed and
delivered by facsimile signature or by other electronic means in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

available, that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale
of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such
Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as
practicable following the effective date of the Initial Shelf, but in any
event within five (5) Business Days of such date, the Company shall notify
the Holders of the effectiveness of such the Initial Shelf.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

2.1.2  _Form of Registration_. If the Company files the Initial Shelf on Form
S-3 (a " _Form S-3 Shelf_") and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to
use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file the Initial Shelf on Form S-1 as
promptly as practicable to replace the shelf registration statement that is
on Form S-3 and have the Initial Shelf declared effective as promptly as
practicable and to cause such Initial Shelf to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Initial
Shelf is available or, if not available, that another Registration Statement
is available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the
Holders until all such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities.

  



  

2.1.3  _Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. At any time and from time to time
following the effectiveness of the Initial Shelf, any Holder may request to
sell all or a portion of their Registrable Securities in a Shelf Underwritten
Offering; _provided_ that such Holder(s) reasonably expects to sell
Registrable Securities yielding aggregate gross proceeds in excess of
$50,000,000 from such Shelf Underwritten Offering (such amount of Registrable
Securities, the " _Minimum Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the New
Holders may request to sell their Registrable Securities in a Shelf
Underwritten Offering yielding less than the Minimum Amount to the extent
that such request comprises all of the remaining Registrable Securities held
by such New Holder. All requests for a Shelf Underwritten Offering shall be
made by giving written notice to the Company (the " _Shelf Take Down Notice_
"). Each Shelf Take Down Notice shall specify the approximate number of
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Shelf Underwritten Offering
and the expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and commissions)
of such Shelf Underwritten Offering. Except with respect to any Registrable
Securities distributed by the Sponsor to its members following the expiration
of the Founder Shares Lock-up Period or the Private Placement Lock-up Period,
as applicable, within five (5) days after receipt of any Shelf Take Down
Notice, the Company shall give written notice of such requested Shelf
Underwritten Offering to all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the "
_Company Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") and, subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.4_ , shall include in such Shelf Underwritten Offering all
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein, within five (5) days after sending the
Company Shelf Takedown Notice. The Company shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities
by the Company with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the
Holders after consultation with the Company and shall take all such other
reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. In connection with any Shelf Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _subsection 2.1.3_ , subject to _Section 3.3_ and
_Article IV_ , the underwriting agreement into which each Holder and the
Company shall enter shall contain such representations, covenants, indemnities
and other rights and obligations of the Company and the selling stockholders
as are customary in underwritten offerings of securities by the Company.

  



  

2.1.4 At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing
date of a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Article II_, the Company
shall use reasonable efforts to notify each Holder in writing (which may be by
email) of the information reasonably necessary about the Holder to include
such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
obligated to include such Holder's Registrable Securities to the extent the
Company has not received such information, and received any other reasonably
requested agreements or certificates, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business
Day prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration
Statement pursuant to this _Article II_.

2.2  _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1  _Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection
2.2.5_ and _Sections 2.4_ and _3.4 _ hereof, and _provided_ that the Company
does not have an effective Registration Statement pursuant to _subsection
2.1.1_ , outstanding covering Registrable Securities, following the
expiration of the Founder Shares Lock-up Period, the Private Placement Lock-
up Period or any other lock-up period, as the case may be, a Demanding Holder
may make a written demand for Registration of all or part of their
Registrable Securities, which written demand shall describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such Registration and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a " _Demand
Registration_ "). The Company shall, within two (2) days of the Company's
receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing all other Holders of
Registrable Securities (other than a Demand Registration with respect to any
Registrable Securities to be distributed by the Sponsor to its members
following the expiration of the Founder Shares Lock-up Period, Private
Placement Lock-up Period or any other lock-up period, as the case may be) of
such demand, and each Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter
wishes to include all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in
a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration (each such Holder that
includes all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in such
Registration, a " _Requesting Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company, in
writing, within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of the
notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written
notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, subject to
_subsection 2.2.4_ below, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have
their Registrable Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable,
but not more than sixty (60) days immediately after the Company's receipt of
the Demand Registration, the Registration of all Registrable Securities
requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders pursuant to such
Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to
effect more than (A) an aggregate of two (2) Registrations pursuant to a
Demand Registration initiated by the Existing Holders and (B) an aggregate of
five (5) Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration initiated by the New
Holders, in each case under this _subsection 2.2.1_ with respect to any or
all Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company
shall not be required to give effect to a Demand Registration from a Demanding
Holder if the Company has registered Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Demand Registration from such Demanding Holder in the preceding one hundred
and eighty (180) days, or (ii) the Company's obligations with respect to any
Demand Registration shall be deemed satisfied so long as the Registration
Statement filed pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ includes all of such
Demanding Holder's Registrable Securities and is effective.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

2.2.2  _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a Registration unless and
until (a) the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect
to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared
effective by the Commission, (b) the Company has complied with all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto and (c) at least 75% of
the Registrable Securities requested by the Requesting Holders to be
registered on behalf of the Requesting Holders in such Registration pursuant
to a Demand Registration have been sold. If, after such Registration Statement
has been declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered
with by any stop order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state court
or any other governmental agency, the Registration Statement with respect to
such Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless
and until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in
writing, but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election. The
Company shall not be obligated or required to file another Registration
Statement until the Registration Statement that has been previously filed
with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration by the same
Demanding Holder becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

  



  

2.2.3  _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection
2.2.4_ and _Sections 2.4_ and _3.4 _ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand
Registration that the offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then
the right of such Demanding Holder or Requesting Holder (if any) to include
its Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon
such Holder's participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of
such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the
extent provided herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
_subsection 2.2.3_, subject to _Section 3.3 _and _Article IV_, shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Company and the
Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders initiating the Demand Registration, which
Underwriter(s) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

2.2.4  _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If a Demand Registration is to
be an Underwritten Offering and the managing Underwriter or Underwriters, in
good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) in writing that, in its opinion, the dollar amount or number
of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Class A Common
Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account and the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has
been requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back
registration rights held by any other stockholders of the Company who desire
to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity
securities that can be sold in such Underwritten Offering without
adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution
method, or the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum
Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten
Offering, as follows:

  



  

(a) first, the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and the
Requesting Holders (if any) (pro rata based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if
any) has requested be included in such Underwritten Registration and the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and
Requesting Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten
Registration (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro_ _Rata_
")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing _clause (a)_, the Registrable Securities of
Holders (Pro Rata, based on the respective number of Registrable Securities
that each Holder has so requested) exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities,

  



  

(c) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing _clauses (a) and (b), _the Class A Common Stock
or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and

  



  

(d) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing _clauses (a), (b)_ and  _(c)_ , the Class A
Common Stock or other equity securities of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.2.5  _Demand Registration Withdrawa_ l. A Demanding Holder or a Requesting
Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or a portion of its Registrable
Securities included in a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_
or a Shelf Underwritten Offering pursuant to _subsection 2.1.3_ for any or
no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of its intention to so withdraw at any
time prior to (a) in the case of a Demand Registration not involving an
Underwritten Offering, the effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement or (b) in the case of any Demand Registration involving an
Underwritten Offering or any Shelf Underwritten Offering, prior to the
pricing of such Underwritten Offering or Shelf Underwritten Offering;
_provided_ , _however_ , that upon withdrawal by a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration (or in the case of a
Shelf Underwritten Offering, withdrawal of an amount of Registrable
Securities included by the Holders in such Shelf Underwritten Offering, in
their capacity as Demanding Holders, being less than the Minimum Amount), the
Company shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable
Registration Statement or complete the Underwritten Offering, as applicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Demand Registration withdrawn pursuant to
this _subsection 2.2.5_ shall be counted toward the aggregate number of
Demand Registrations the Company is obligated to effect pursuant to
_subsection 2.2.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
or a Shelf Underwritten Offering prior to its withdrawal under this
_subsection 2.2.5_.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

2.3  _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1  _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the
stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Section 2.2 _hereof), other than a Registration Statement (a) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (b) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing
stockholders, (c) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity
securities of the Company, for a dividend reinvestment plan, (d) for any
issuances of securities in connection with a transaction involving a
merger, consolidation, sale, exchange, issuance, transfer, reorganization or
other extraordinary transaction between the Company or any of its Affiliates
and any third party, or (e) filed pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_, then the
Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to all of the
Holders of Registrable Securities (excluding the Sponsor with respect to any
Registrable Securities distributed by the Sponsor to its members following the
expiration of the Founder Shares Lock-up Period or the Private Placement
Lock-up Period, as applicable) as soon as practicable but not less than twenty
(20) days before the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement,
which notice shall (i) describe the amount and type of securities to be
included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution (including
whether such registration will be pursuant to a shelf
registration statement), and the proposed price and name of the proposed
managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, (ii)
describe such Holders' rights under this _Section 2.3_, and (iii) offer to
all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the
sale of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in
writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (such
Registration, a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good
faith, cause such Registrable Securities identified in a Holder's response
noticed described in the foregoing sentence to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering, if
any, to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant
to this _subsection 2.3.1_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the
same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company or Company
stockholder(s) for whose account the Registration Statement is to be
filed included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
_subsection 2.3.1_, subject to _Section 3.3_ and _Article IV_, shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s)
selected for such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

  



  

2.3.2  _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If a Piggyback Registration is
to be an Underwritten Offering and the managing Underwriter or Underwriters,
in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities
participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing that, in its opinion,
the dollar amount or number of the Class A Common Stock that the Company
desires to sell, taken together with (a) the Class A Common Stock, if any, as
to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, (b) the Registrable Securities
as to which registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof,
and (c) the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back
registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum
Number of Securities, then:

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

2.3.2.1 if the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account, the
Company shall include in any such Registration (a) first, the Class A Common
Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (b) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing _clause (a)_, the Registrable
Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their Registrable
Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, Pro Rata, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (c) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to
which Registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-
back registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

2.3.2.2 if the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall
include in any such Registration (a) first, the Class A Common Stock or other
equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than
the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities; (b) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing _clause (a)_,
the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, Pro
Rata, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
(c) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing  _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , the Class A Common
Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (d) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing _clauses (a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_ , the Class
A Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.3.3  _Piggyback Registration Withdrawa_ l. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw all or any portion of its
Registrable Securities in a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw such
Registrable Securities from such Piggyback Registration prior to (a) in the
case of a Piggyback Registration not involving an Underwritten Offering or
Shelf Underwritten Offering, the effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement or (b) in the case of any Piggyback Registration involving an
Underwritten Offering or any Shelf Underwritten Offering, prior to the pricing
of such Underwritten Offering or Shelf Underwritten Offering. The Company
(whether on its own good-faith determination or as the result of a request for
withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations)
may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection
with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.3.3_.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

2.3.4  _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.3 _hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section 2.2_ hereof or a Shelf Underwritten Offering effected under
_subsection 2.1.3_.

  



  

2.4  _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (a) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good-faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the effective date of, a Company initiated Registration and
_provided_ that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior
to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (b) the
Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company and the
Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (c) in the good-faith judgment of the Board such
Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
(or, if applicable, any Co-Chairman of the Board) stating that in the good-
faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously detrimental to the Company
for such Registration Statement to be filed in the near future and that it is
therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement. In
such event, the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period
of not more than sixty (60) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any twelve
(12)-month period.

  



  

2.5  _Block Trades_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
but subject to _Sections 2.4 and 3.4_ , if the New Holders desire to effect a
Block Trade, then notwithstanding any other time periods in this _Article II_
, the New Holders shall provide written notice to the Company at least two
(2) business days prior to the date such Block Trade is anticipated
to commence. If requested by the New Holders, the Company will promptly
notify other Holders of such Block Trade and such notified Holders may elect
whether or not to participate no later than the next Business Day (i.e., one
(1) Business Day prior to the day such offering is to commence) (unless a
longer period is agreed to by the New Holders), and the Company will as
expeditiously as possible use its best efforts to facilitate such Block Trade
(which may close as early as two (2) Business Days after the date it
commences). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Holder (other than a New Holder) will be permitted to participate in an Block
Trade without the consent of the New Holders. Any Holder's request to
participate in a Block Trade shall be binding on such Holder.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

2.6  _Lock-up Periods_.

  



  

2.6.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except with respect to transfers to a Permitted Transferee, each Existing
Holder agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any
sale pursuant to Rule 144, any Founder Shares during the Founder Shares Lock-
Up Period or Private Placement Warrants during the Private Placement Lock-Up
Period; provided that, except with respect to transfers to a Permitted
Transferee, the Sponsor shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or any other equity
security of the Company or any security convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity security of the Company during the period beginning
on the date of this Agreement and ending on the first anniversary of the date
of this Agreement, other than (a) as distributions to limited partners or
members of the Sponsor; and (b) by virtue of the laws of the State of
Delaware or of the Sponsor's organizational documents upon liquidation or
dissolution of the Sponsor, in each case immediately following which Brent
Saunders and Manisha Narasimhan shall collectively hold a majority of the
Founder Shares then outstanding; provided, further, that in the event of any
such distribution, liquidation or dissolution that results in Brent Saunders
and/or Manisha Narasimhan becoming Existing Holders, except with respect to
transfers to their Permitted Transferees, such person(s) (and their Permitted
Transferees to whom they transfer) shall not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or any other
equity security of the Company or any security convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the Company during the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

2.6.2 Each Holder participating in a Registration (each, a " _Participating
Holder_ ") agrees, to the extent requested in writing by a managing
Underwriter, if any, of any Underwritten Offering hereunder, not to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144,
any shares of Common Stock, or any other equity security of the Company or any
security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity
security of the Company other than as part of such underwritten public
offering during the time period reasonably requested by the managing
underwriter, not to exceed 30 days from the date such Underwritten Offering
is priced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Participating Holder shall be
required to agree to any such restrictions unless each other Participating
Holder is also required to agree to such restrictions, (ii) the managing
Underwriter (if any) may waive such restrictions in its reasonable discretion
upon the written request of a Holder, subject to the terms set forth in any
written lock-up agreement with respect thereto, and (iii) any waiver or
release of such lock-up, holdback or similar agreement shall be on a
consistent basis among the Participating Holders.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
 COMPANY PROCEDURES

  



  

3.1  _General Procedures_. If the Company is required to effect the
Registration of Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Registration to permit the sale
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution thereof. When effective, the Registration Statements filed
pursuant to this Agreement (including the documents incorporated therein by
reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain
a Misstatement. In connection with effecting a Registration of Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall, as expeditiously as
possible:

  



  

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and,
except as otherwise set forth herein, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective
until all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have
been sold;

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the
Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by a majority in interest of the
applicable Holders of Registrable Securities registered on such Registration
Statement or any Underwriter of Registrable Securities or as may be required
by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form
used by the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations
thereunder to keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with
the intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters,
if any, and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration, and such Holders' legal counsel, copies of such Registration
Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such
Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such
other documents as the Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration or the legal counsel for any such Holders may
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Holders;

  



  

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, but in any case
no later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as
the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
(in light of their intended plan of distribution) may request and to keep
such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such Registration
Statement remains in effect, and (b) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other governmental authorities or securities
exchanges, including the applicable Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), as
may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company or
otherwise and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable, in each case, to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any
action to which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation
in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its
commercially reasonable efforts to amend or supplement such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or prevent the issuance of any stop
order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued, as
applicable;

  



  

3.1.8 at least five (5) business days (or, in the case of a Block Trade, at
least one (1) day) prior to the filing of any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into such

providing copies promptly upon receipt of any comment letters received with
respect to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus;

Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement or include such information as is necessary
to comply with law, in each case as set forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

3.1.10 permit a representative of the New Holders, the Underwriters, if any,
and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriter to
participate, at each such person's own expense, in the preparation of any
Registration Statement and cause the Company's officers, directors and

3.1.11 obtain a "comfort" letter (including a bring-down letter dated as of
the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to such
Registration) from the Company's independent registered public accountants in
the event of an Underwritten Offering that the participating Holders may rely
on, in customary form and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by "comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may

the participating Holders and any Underwriter;

  



  

3.1.12 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant
to such Registration, obtain an opinion and negative assurance letter, dated
such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such

if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect
to the Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the
Holders, placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably
request and as are customarily included in such opinions and negative
assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of
the participating Holders and any Underwriter;

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.14 otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all

its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least twelve (12) months, beginning with the first
day of the Company's first full calendar quarter after the effective date
of the Registration Statement which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a)
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including
Rule 158 thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission);

  



  

3.1.15 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable

reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

3.2  _Registration Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the

is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental
selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as

Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing
the Holders.

  



  

3.3  _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No Person may participate in

customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements,
underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be reasonably

18

 



    



  

3.4  _Suspension of Sales ; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains
a Misstatement, or in the opinion of counsel for the Company it is necessary
to supplement or amend such Prospectus to comply with law, each of the
Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
until it has received copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus
correcting the Misstatement or including the information counsel for the
Company instructs is necessary to comply with law (it being understood that
the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment
as soon as practicable after the time of such notice such that the
Registration Statement or Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, as
applicable, will not include a Misstatement and complies with law), or until
it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be
resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a
Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the
inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company's control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time required to resolve
such issue, but in no event more than sixty (60) consecutive days, determined
in good faith by the Board to be necessary for such purpose; _provided_ that
the Company shall not defer its obligations in this manner more than twice
during any twelve (12)-month period pursuant to _Section 2.4_ hereof. In the
event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration
in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period
during which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_. The Holders
agree that, except as required by applicable law, the Holders shall treat as
confidential the receipt of written notice from the Company under this
_Section 3.4_ (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any
material nonpublic information of the Company) and shall not disclose or use
the information contained in such written notice without the prior written
consent of the Company until such time as the information contained therein
is or becomes public, other than as a result of disclosure by a holder of
Registrable Securities in breach of the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

3.5  _Covenants of the Company_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the Holders with
true and complete copies of all such filings. The Company further covenants
that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell
shares of Class A Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions.

  



  

3.6  _Information_. The Holders shall provide such information as may
reasonably be requested by the Company, or the managing Underwriter, if any,
in connection with the preparation of any Registration Statement, including
amendments and supplements thereto, in order to effect the Registration of
any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to _Article II_
and in connection with the Company's obligation to comply with federal and
applicable state securities laws.

ARTICLE IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

4.1  _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and agents and
each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
Misstatement or alleged Misstatement, except insofar as the same are
contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by
such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and agents and each Person who
controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the
same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification
of the Holder.

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each Person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any Misstatement or
alleged Misstatement, but only to the extent that such Misstatement or alleged
Misstatement is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in
writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several,
among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such
Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the
net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities
in such offering giving rise to such liability. The Holders of Registrable
Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and
each Person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect
to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

4.1.3 Any Person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any Person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or such
Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any Misstatement
or alleged Misstatement, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action and the benefits received by
the such indemnifying party or indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_
, that the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be
limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities in such offering giving rise to such liability.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other
liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_, _4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by Pro Rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation, which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

warrants that this Agreement supersedes any other registration rights
agreement or agreement with similar terms and conditions among the parties
thereto and in the event of a conflict between any such agreement or
agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. To
the extent the Company grants any Person(s) the right to request the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to register any equity securities of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any securities convertible or exchangeable into

registration rights to the New Holders in connection therewith.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

5.7  _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, (b) the date as of which all of
the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration Statement
(but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section

are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 1.1 _LCP Representation_. LCP shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to nominate to the Board (such nominees, the " _LCP Directors_ ")
(subject to their election by the stockholders of the Company) that number of
individuals that, if elected, will result in LCP having the number of
directors serving on the Board that is shown below:

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Date:

  



  

(i) Three (3) directors for so long as LCP holds a number of shares of Common
Stock representing at least forty percent (40%) of the shares of Common Stock
then outstanding;

  



  

(ii) Two (2) directors for so long as LCP holds a number of shares of Common
Stock representing less than forty percent (40%) but at least fifteen percent
(15%) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; and

  



  

(iii) One (1) director for so long as LCP holds a number of shares of Common

(b) If, at any time, LCP ceases to hold a number of shares of Common Stock

above, if there is more than one LCP Director, LCP may by written notice to
the Board, within five Business Days of ceasing to hold such number of shares
of Common Stock, designate which directors shall be the LCP Directors and the
other directors shall resign from the Board upon the written request of the
Board (other than the LCP Directors); _provided_ , that, if no such notice is
received by the Board within 10 business days after the same has been
requested in writing of LCP, the Board (other than the LCP Directors) shall
determine which of the LCP Directors shall continue in office and which shall
resign from the Board. At any time after LCP ceases to hold at least ten
percent (10%) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, the LCP
Director shall resign from the Board upon the written request of the Board.

  



  

(c) So long as LCP holds ten percent (10%) or more of the then outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Company shall take all necessary and desirable
actions to cause each of the Compensation Committee of the Board and the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board to include in its
membership at least one of the LCP Directors, except to the extent such
membership would violate applicable securities laws or stock exchange or
stock market rules.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Date, unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by LCP, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, take all actions
necessary (including, without limitation, calling special meetings of the
Board and the stockholders of the Company and recommending, supporting and
soliciting proxies) to ensure that: (i) the applicable LCP Directors are (a)
designated as Class III and/or Class II directors pursuant to Section 5.2(b)
of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
(b) included in the Board's slate of nominees to the stockholders of the
Company and recommended by the Board at any meeting of stockholders called
for the purpose of electing directors, in each case, to the extent necessary
such that the number of LCP Directors that LCP is eligible to designate shall
be designated; and (ii) each applicable LCP Director up for election in
accordance with the foregoing is included in the proxy statement prepared by
management of the Company in connection with the Company's solicitation of
proxies or consents in favor of the foregoing for every meeting of the
stockholders of the Company called with respect to the election of directors,
and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or
approval by written resolution of the stockholders of the Company or the Board
with respect to the election of directors; _provided_ , that any individuals
nominated under this _Section 1.1_ shall (x) be reasonably acceptable to the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the " _Nominating
Committee_ ") (or the Board, other than the LCP Directors, if there is no
such Nominating Committee), and (y) in the good faith judgment of the
Nominating Committee (or the Board, other than the LCP Directors, if there is
no such Nominating Committee) satisfy the requirements set forth in the
Company's Organizational Documents and corporate governance guidelines (as in
effect from time to time), in each case as are applicable to all non-
employee directors generally, including any independence requirements as set
forth herein or otherwise.

(e) If any LCP Director ceases to serve for any reason (including because of
the death, disability, disqualification, resignation, or removal of such LCP
Director), LCP shall, subject to LCP then being entitled to designate such
individual for nomination as a director pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_, be
entitled to designate such person's successor in accordance with this
Agreement and the Board shall promptly fill the vacancy with such successor
LCP Director.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Letter of Resignation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the election or appointment of any LCP Director to the
Board shall be subject to the prior execution by such LCP Director of an
irrevocable resignation letter in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Reimbursement of Expenses; Indemnification_. For so long as any
LCP Director serves as a director on the Board, the Company shall (i)
provide such LCP Director with the same expense reimbursement, benefits and
other arrangements provided to the other members of the Board, (ii) indemnify
such LCP Director on the same basis as all other members of the Board and
(iii) not amend, alter or repeal any right to indemnification or exculpation
covering or benefiting any LCP Director as and to the extent consistent with
applicable law, including but not limited to any rights contained in the
Company's Organizational Documents (except to the extent such amendment or
alteration permits the Company to provide broader indemnification or
exculpation rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto).

  



  

Section 1.4 _Director Obligations_. Any LCP Director shall, upon the election
or appointment of such LCP Director to the Board, execute such agreements as
are required to be executed by all non-employee directors generally and shall
otherwise abide by the provisions of all codes and policies of the Company
that are applicable to all non-employee directors generally, including, as
applicable, the Company's insider trading policy, policies requiring the pre-
clearance of all securities trading activity, the Company's code of

Vesper Healthcare Acquisition Corp. 
 1819 West Avenue, Bay 2

  



  

Miami Beach, FL 33139

  



   | Re:| _Investor Representation Letter_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

The undersigned (the " _Holder_ ") is a holder of Shares of LCP Edge
Intermediate, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Vesper
Healthcare Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), is
acquiring the Company pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of December 8, 2020 (as it may be amended from time to time in
accordance with its terms, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Parent,
First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative. Capitalized terms used in this letter (this "
_Investor Representation Letter_ ") and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Upon the closing of the First Merger (the " _Closing_ " and, the date of such
Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "), each share of issued and outstanding
Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock held by the Holder (other
than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be
cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to
receive a certain amount of cash and a certain number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, in a private placement effected in reliance on the exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
" _Securities Act_ "), provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and exemptions from
the qualification requirements of applicable state law. The Holder
acknowledges and agrees that Parent is relying on the truth and accuracy of
the representations and warranties made by the Holder in this Investor
Representation Letter in order to rely on the exemptions described above.

  



  

1\. _Representations, Warranties and Certain Agreements of the Holder_. The
Holder hereby makes the following representations, warranties and
agreements to Parent, each of which representations and warranties is true
and correct as to the Holder as of the date hereof and will be true and
correct on and as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date.

  



  

1.1 _Investment Representation Authorization Letter_. This Investor
Representation Letter constitutes the Holder's valid and legally binding
obligation, enforceable against the Holder in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by: (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; or (b) the effect of rules of
law governing the availability of equitable remedies.

  



  

   

1

 



    

  



  

1.2 _Acquisition for Own Account_. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be
acquired by the Holder pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be acquired for
investment for the Holder's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not
with a view to the public resale or distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act.

  



  

1.3 _No Solicitation_. The Holder's decision to invest in the Parent Common
Stock was not a result of any publicly issued or circulated newspaper, mail,
radio, television or other form of general advertising or solicitation in
connection with the offer, sale and purchase of the Parent Common Stock by
Parent or its agents.

  



  

1.4 _Accredited Investor_. The Holder is an accredited investor as defined in
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

  



  

1.5 _Disclosure of Information_. The Holder has received or has had full
access to all the information the Holder considers necessary or
appropriate to make an informed investment decision with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock. The Holder further has had an opportunity to
ask questions and receive answers from Parent regarding the terms and
conditions of the offering of the shares of Parent Common Stock and to obtain
additional information necessary to verify any information furnished to the
Holder or to which the Holder had access.

  



  

1.6 _Understanding of Risks_. The Holder is fully aware of: (a) the highly
speculative nature of the shares of Parent Common Stock; and (b)
the financial risk involved.

  



  

1.7 _The Holder 's Qualifications_. The Holder has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that the Holder is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of this prospective investment, has the
capacity to protect the Holder's own interests in connection with this
transaction and is financially capable of bearing a total loss of the shares
of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

1.8 _Compliance with Securities Laws_. The Holder understands and
acknowledges that, in reliance upon the representations and warranties
made by the Holder herein, the shares of Parent Common Stock are not being
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws, but instead are being transferred
under an exemption or exemptions from the registration and qualification
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws which
impose certain restrictions on the Holder's ability to transfer the shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  



  

1.9 _Restricted Securities_. The Holder agrees not to make any disposition of
all or any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock unless and until: (a)
there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act
covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance
with such registration statement; or (b) the Holder shall have furnished
Parent with an opinion of counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, that such disposition will not require registration of the shares of
Parent Common Stock under the Securities Act and otherwise complies with
applicable state securities laws; _provided _ that no such registration
statement or opinion shall be required for dispositions effected under Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act or to a transferee who executes and
delivers a letter with representations substantially in form of this Investor
Representation Letter.

  



  

   

2

 



    

  



  

1.10 _Rule 144_. The Holder acknowledges that, because the shares of Parent
Common Stock have not been registered under the Securities Act, such shares
must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities
Act or unless an exemption from such registration is available. The Holder is
aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.

  



  

1.11 _Contractual Restrictions_. The Holder acknowledges and agrees that the
Parent Common Stock to be acquired by the Holder pursuant to the Merger
Agreement is subject to additional restrictions on transfer set forth in the
Lock-Up Agreement by and among Parent, the Holder and the other parties
thereto (the " _Lock-Up Agreement_ ") entered into concurrently with the
Closing and agrees to comply with the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement.

  



  

1.12 _Legends_. The certificates or book-entry entitlements representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock shall bear the following legend (as well as any
other legends required by applicable state and federal securities laws, the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Lock-Up Agreement) until such time as
such legends are no longer relevant or applicable:

  



  

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS
AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH SALE OR DISTRIBUTION MAY BE
EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN
OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

  



  

The legend shall be removed by Parent from any certificate or book-entry
entitlement evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock upon a transfer of
such Parent Common Stock (a) pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act that is at that time in effect with respect to offers and
sales by the Holder of the Parent Common Stock or (b) if requested by
the Company or the transfer agent of the Parent Common Stock, upon delivery
of an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Parent, that such security can be freely transferred without requiring
registration thereof under the Securities Act.

  



  

1.13 _Stop-Transfer Instructions_. The Holder agrees that, in order to ensure
compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Investor
Representation Letter, Parent may issue appropriate "stop-transfer"
instructions to its transfer agent. Parent will not be required: (a) to
transfer on its books any shares of Parent Common Stock that have been sold or
otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Investor
Representation Letter; or (b) to treat as owner of such shares of Parent
Common Stock, or to accord the right to vote or receive dividends, to any
purchaser or other transferee to whom such shares of Parent Common Stock have
been so transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Investor
Representation Letter or the Lock-Up Agreement.

  



  

2\. _Entire Agreement_. This Investor Representation Letter, the Registration
Rights Agreement, the Lock-Up Agreement and the Merger Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Investor Representation Letter, and supersede all
prior understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between or among
the parties hereto with respect to the specific subject matter hereof.

with the Escrow Agent. Amounts on deposit in the CDA are insured up to a
total of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank (including principal and
accrued interest) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_
"), subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the FDIC. The Parties
understand that deposits in the CDA are not secured. Neither of the
Parties nor the Escrow Agent shall be liable or responsible in any manner for
any loss or depreciation resulting from any such Permitted Investment or any
liquidation thereof, or for any costs in connection therewith, and all of said
losses and costs shall be borne by the Escrow Accounts, except to the extent
such losses or costs are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have been caused by the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and
sales of Permitted Investments through the facilities of its own trading
or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity, subject to
the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to each
of the Parties on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Accounts
for the preceding month. The Escrow Agent will act upon any Joint Instruction
the day that such instructions are received; _provided that_ such Joint
Instructions are communicated within a reasonable amount of time to allow the
Escrow Agent to make the specified investment.

  



  

(b) The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide
supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of
moneys held in the Escrow Accounts or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment.

  



  

(c) Although the Parties recognize that they may obtain a broker confirmation
or written statement containing comparable information at no additional cost,
the Parties hereby agree that confirmations of Permitted Investments are not
required to be issued by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly
statement is rendered.

  



  

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the delivery of the escrowed
property is subject to the sale and final settlement of
Permitted Investments. Proceeds of a sale of Permitted Investments will be
delivered on the Business Day on which the Joint Instruction is delivered to
the Escrow Agent if received prior to the deadline for same day sale of such
Permitted Investments. If such Joint Instruction is received after the
applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding
Business Day.

  



  

4\. _Release of Escrow Funds_. No part of the Escrow Funds may be withdrawn
or distributed from the Escrow Account except pursuant to either (i) a joint
written instruction signed by Parent and Representative (a " _Joint
Instruction_ ") directing the Escrow Agent to pay or otherwise distribute the
Escrow Funds or (ii) a fixed, nonappealable judgment, order and decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction which may be filed, entered or issued (each,
a " _Final Order_ ") directing the Escrow Agent to pay or otherwise
distribute the Escrow Funds. Within two (2) Business Days after the Escrow
Agent's receipt of a Joint Instruction or Final Order, the Escrow Agent shall
pay or otherwise distribute the Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account in
accordance with such Joint Instruction or such Final Order, as applicable.

5\. _Conditions to Escrow_. The Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow Funds
and to perform its obligations in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. The Parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall not assume any
responsibility for the failure of the Parties to perform in accordance with
the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. The acceptance by the Escrow Agent of
its responsibilities hereunder is subject to the following terms and
conditions, which the parties hereto agree shall govern and control with
respect to the Escrow Agent's rights, duties and liabilities hereunder:

  



  

(a) _Documents_. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any
written notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or
document furnished to it, not only as to its due execution and validity and
the effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth and accuracy of
any information therein contained, which the Escrow Agent in good faith
believes to be genuine and what it purports to be. Should it be necessary for
the Escrow Agent to act upon any instructions, directions, documents or
instruments issued or signed by or on behalf of any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, fiduciary or individual acting on behalf
of another party hereto, it shall not be necessary for the Escrow Agent to
inquire into such corporation's, limited liability company's, partnership's,
fiduciary's or individual's authority. The Escrow Agent is also relieved
from the necessity of satisfying itself as to the authority of the person
executing this Agreement in the capacity of Representative on behalf of the
Shareholders. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers' forms in
the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ to this Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer instructions received in the
name of Parties by confirming with an authorized individual as evidence in
Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, Exhibit A-1
or Exhibit A-2 may be revised or rescinded only in writing signed by an
authorized representative of the Party.

  



  

(b) _Liability_. Provided the Escrow Agent complies with Joint Instructions
or Final Orders furnished to it by Parent and Representative and with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith,
except for its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.

  



  

(c) _Legal Counsel_. The Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice
from, reputable legal counsel in the event of any question as to any of the
provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and
shall be fully protected in acting in good faith in accordance with the
reasonable opinion and instructions of such counsel.

  



  

(d) _Limitation of Duties_. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except
those which are expressly set forth herein and it shall not be bound by any
agreements of the other parties hereto, including, without limitation, the
Merger Agreement (whether or not it has any knowledge thereof). The Escrow
Agent shall not be deemed a fiduciary for any party to this Agreement.
Provided the Escrow Agent complies with joint instructions furnished to it by
PARENT and Representative AND FINAL ORDERS, AND WITH THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR
ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED
HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY
ADJUDICATED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW AGENT'S FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS),
EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR
DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

  



  

   

3

 



    

  



  

(e) _Resignation or Termination of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall have
the right to resign at any time by giving thirty (30) calendar days prior
written notice of such resignation to the Parties and the Parties shall have
the right to terminate the services of the Escrow Agent hereunder at any time
by giving joint written notice (with such written notice being signed by the
Parties) of such termination to the Escrow Agent, in each case specifying the
effective date of such resignation or termination. Within thirty (30) days
after receiving or delivering the aforesaid notice, as the case may be, the
Parties agree to appoint a successor escrow agent to which the Escrow Agent
shall distribute the property then held hereunder in accordance with the terms
hereof. If a successor escrow agent has not been appointed and has not
accepted such appointment by the end of such thirty (30)-day period, the
Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent, and the reasonable costs and
expenses which are incurred in connection with any such proceeding shall be
paid one-half by Representative, on the one hand, and one-half by Parent, on
the other hand. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, no
Escrow Funds shall be released from the Escrow Accounts unless and until a
successor escrow agent has been appointed in accordance with this _Section
5(e)_.

  



  

(f) _Discharge of Escrow Agent_. Upon delivery of all of the Escrow Funds
pursuant to the terms of _Section 4_ above or to a successor Escrow Agent,
the Escrow Agent shall thereafter be discharged from any further obligations
hereunder. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in any and all events, to
comply with and obey any and all Final Orders, and, if it shall so comply or
obey, it shall not be liable to any other person by reason of such compliance
or obedience. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive and may
conclusively rely upon an opinion of counsel to the effect that a judgment,
order or decree is final, nonappealable and from a court of
competent jurisdiction.

  



  

(g) _Interpleading of Assets upon Dispute_. In the event that (i) any dispute
shall arise between the Parties with respect to the disposition or
disbursement of any of the assets held hereunder or (ii) the Escrow Agent
shall be uncertain as to how to proceed in a situation not explicitly
addressed by the terms of this Agreement whether because of conflicting
demands by the Parties or otherwise, the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to
interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent
jurisdiction, and thereafter, absent its own fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct, be fully relieved from any and all liability or
obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets. The Parties further agree
to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with such a dispute, without
making the Escrow Agent a party to the same.

  



  

(h) _Agency_. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to perform any of its
duties hereunder through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees; provided,
however, that the Escrow Agent shall be fully responsible for any acts and
omissions of any such agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed
without due care.

  



  

(i) _Merger of Escrow Agent_. Any banking association or corporation into
which the Escrow Agent may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow
Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or
any banking association or corporation to which all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall
succeed to all the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and immunities
hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the Parties, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding.

  



  

   

4

 



    

  



  

(j) _Garnishment of Escrow Funds_. In the event that any of the Escrow Funds
shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the
delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any
order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with
all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation, by reason of such
compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

6\. _Income_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge that, for federal and
state income tax purposes, any interest, earnings and other income earned on,
or derived from, and any deductions attributable to fees and costs of, the
Escrow Accounts (the " _Income_ ") shall be income and deductions of Parent.
Promptly following the end of each calendar quarter and the release of the
Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent an amount equal to
thirty percent (30%) of any Income earned, if any, during such calendar
quarter or such other period. Parent agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with
an executed Form W-9. The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for reporting any
Income earned to the Internal Revenue Service. Any taxes payable on Income
earned from the investment of any sums held hereunder shall be paid by Parent
whether or not the Income was distributed by the Escrow Agent during any
particular year and to the extent required under provisions of the Code. The
Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to pay any taxes or estimated taxes
with respect to the Escrow Accounts. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any tax or information
return with respect to any transactions, whether or not related to the
Agreement, that occurs outside the Escrow Accounts.

  



  

7\. _Indemnification_. Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify the
Escrow Agent for and to hold it harmless against any loss, liability or
reasonable out-of-pocket expense (including reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred without gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud on the part of the Escrow Agent arising out of or
in connection with its performance under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for not more than 50% of any such
losses, liabilities, fees or expenses.

  



  

8\. _Escrow Costs_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to be paid a fee for
its services pursuant to the attached _Exhibit B_ and to be reimbursed for
its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with maintaining the Escrow Accounts hereunder, which fees, costs
and expenses shall be paid by Parent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct from the Escrow Funds
any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification
rights from such Escrow Funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Agent
must provide at least ten (10) days advance written notice to the Parties
prior to any such set off and deduction. In the event that the Escrow Agent
exercises its right to set off (as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence), the amount of such set off shall be replenished into the Escrow
Funds by Parent.

  



  

9\. _Limitations on Rights to Escrow Funds_. None of the Parties shall have
any right, title or interest in or to, or possession of, the Escrow Accounts
and therefore shall not have the ability to pledge, convey, hypothecate or
grant as security all or any portion of the Escrow Funds unless and until
such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to _Section 4_ above.
Accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall be in sole possession of the Escrow Funds
and shall not act as custodian of the Parties under this Agreement for
the purposes of perfecting a security interest therein, and no creditor of
any of the Parties shall have any right to have or to hold or otherwise
attach or seize all or any portion of the Escrow Funds as collateral for any
obligation and shall not be able to obtain a security interest in any of the
Escrow Funds unless and until such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to
_Section 4 _above.
