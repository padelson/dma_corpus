Agreements entered into by Parent with the applicable investors named therein (collectively, the &ldquo;<U>PIPE Investors</U>&rdquo;),
pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent in the aggregate amount of $350,000,000
(the &ldquo;<U>PIPE Investment Amount</U>&rdquo;). As of the Closing Date, assuming (a) the funding of the full amount of the PIPE
Investment Amount in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions of the Subscription Agreements, (b) the
accuracy in all material respects of the Company&rsquo;s and the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s representations and

Company with its covenants, agreements and obligations under <U>Article VII</U> of this Agreement, and (c) satisfaction of the
condition set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.03(f)</U>, the aggregate amount of Available Cash will be sufficient to enable Parent
to pay all cash amounts required to be paid by Parent under or in connection with this Agreement. To Parent&rsquo;s Knowledge,
with respect to each PIPE Investor as of the date hereof, the Subscription Agreements are in full force and effect and have not
been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification
is contemplated by Parent. Each Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to Parent&rsquo;s
Knowledge, each PIPE Investor. Neither the execution nor delivery by Parent, or, to Parent&rsquo;s Knowledge, any other party thereto,
of, nor the performance of Parent&rsquo;s, or, to Parent&rsquo;s Knowledge, any other party&rsquo;s obligations under, such Subscription
Agreement violates any applicable Laws. There are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements between Parent and any PIPE
Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement that would affect the obligation of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent
the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and, as of the date hereof, Parent
does not know of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any
Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment Amount not being available to Parent, on the Closing Date. No
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
under any material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the
conditions contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the
applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein. No fees, consideration
or other discounts are payable or have been agreed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to any PIPE Investor in respect of its PIPE Investment, except as set forth in the Subscription
Agreements.</P>

therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent and
will not, prior to the Closing, seek recourse against the Parent Trust (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason

indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees
