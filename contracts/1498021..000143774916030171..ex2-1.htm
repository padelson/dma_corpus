($35.05) in cash;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, the Parent Board and the Merger Sub Board have

Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company and Parent have
entered into an agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form

of Company Common Stock and Company Restricted Shares (collectively, the "
_Rollover Shares_ ") set forth therein (the " _Rollover Investment_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
_Section 9.03_.

 



 

 



   



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



 

Article I. _ 
The Merger_

 



 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ").

 



 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to _Article VIII_ and unless otherwise agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Paul Hastings LLP, 1170 Peachtree Street N.E., Suite
100, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 8:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be
specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the third
(3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent; __provided__ , __however__ , that if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
then the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a Business Day
during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing
Period, as the Marketing Period may be extended in accordance with the terms
hereof (subject in each case in clause (a) and clause (b) above to the
satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ for the Closing as of the date
determined pursuant to this proviso). The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 



 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
with the Delaware Secretary the certificate of merger relating to the Merger
(the " _Certificate_ _of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary, or at
such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 1.05 _Certificate_ _of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The certificate
of incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit_ _ B_ and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to
the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 



 

Article II. _ 
Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 



 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned
Stock_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Rollover
Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, the Rollover Shares contributed to
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections_ _ 2.02_
and _2.03_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (x) the Specified Shares
and (y) any shares of Company Common Stock the holder of which: (i) has not
voted in favor of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger or consented
thereto in writing, (ii) has properly demanded appraisal of such shares in the
time and manner provided in, and who has otherwise complied with, Section 262
of the DGCL and, (iii) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his or her rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Appraisal_ _Shares_ "), shall be converted into
the right to receive Thirty-Five Dollars and Five Cents ($35.05) in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") subject to any withholding
of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with _Section
2.02(i)_. All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry
form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is
based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock will be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund; Deliverables_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its
sole cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
and delivery of the Merger Consideration. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for payment in accordance with this _Article II_
through the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration. All
such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ ".

 



 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall be in such form and have such
other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify subject to the Company's approval, and shall be prepared prior to
the Closing), together with instructions thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Award Release_ _Agreements_. As reasonably promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each holder of record of a
Company Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, an Award Release
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _C_ (an "
_Award Release Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (ii) in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together with such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.01_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is
held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(d)_ , each
share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall
be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such
shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
(or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to
Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; __provided__ , that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have
a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish
the rights of any of the Company's shareholders to receive the Merger
Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are
losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any
other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_ , Parent
shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so
as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSU Awards or
Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares,
Company RSU Awards or Company Stock Options, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it

Section 2.03 _Appraisal_ _Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, and who has properly demanded appraisal rights
under, and who has otherwise complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Appraisal_ _Rights_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_ , but instead
the holders of such Appraisal Shares shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL. In such case, at the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except with respect to Appraisal Rights and as provided
in this _Section 2.03_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have otherwise waived, or effectively
withdrawn or lost such holder's Appraisal Rights or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have determined that such holder is not entitled to the
Appraisal Rights, then such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be considered Appraisal Shares for the purposes hereof and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as
provided in _Section 2.01_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any
notices or demands for appraisal by any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other
instruments received by the Company relating to the Appraisal Rights, and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands, notices or instruments. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order of a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, settle or offer to settle any such demands, notices or
instruments.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Escrow_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Escrow Agent, for the benefit of the holders of unvested Company Stock
Awards, as more fully discussed in _Section 6.04(c)_ , for payment in
accordance with _Section 6.04_ through the Escrow Agent, cash sufficient to
pay the Unvested Option Payments and the Unvested Restricted Share/RSU
Payments (the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow
Funds in escrow pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. All Escrow Funds shall be released to the applicable Company
Stock Award holders in accordance with the original vesting schedule and other
terms of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSU
Awards which are unvested as of the Effective Time, as more fully set forth
herein and in the Escrow Agreement. Any release of Escrow Funds to the holders
of Company Stock Awards shall be made by distribution to the Surviving Company
to be distributed to the applicable Company Stock Award holders via the
Surviving Company's payroll system in the first payroll period after such
amount has become due and payable. Subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is
thirty (30) days after the last remaining Company Stock Award has vested (the
" _Release Date_ "), Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to release any
amounts then remaining in the Escrow Account (including any interest, income
and profits thereon) to the Surviving Company. The fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent shall be paid by Parent.

 



 

 



   



 

Article III. _ 
Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and
correct except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to
the Company at or before the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article III_ , but the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify any other section in this
_Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other section.

 



 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all corporate or limited
partnership power and authority required to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, in the case of the Parent, the Escrow Agreement, and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to perform each of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary. Prior to the date hereof, the Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company or Company's Representatives accurate and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter and
organizational documents of Parent and Merger Sub, including all amendments
thereto, as in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or limited partnership power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder, and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent Board has unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is
in the best interests of Parent and its equityholders. As of the date of this
Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The Merger Sub
Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Merger Sub; (ii) determining
that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of Merger Sub and
its shareholders; (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable; and (iv)
recommending that the shareholder of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement and
directing that this Agreement be submitted to the shareholder of Merger Sub
for adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn. The shareholder of Merger Sub has adopted and approved
this Agreement. No other corporate proceedings (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any shareholder approval) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement (or,
in the case of Parent, the Escrow Agreement) or to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing
of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement (and,
in the case of Parent, the Escrow Agreement) constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other

in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any
Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit, require a
consent or waiver under, require the payment of a penalty or change in control
payment under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound; or
(iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in _Section

judgment, order or decree (" _Judgment_ "), statute, law (including common
law), ordinance, rule, regulation or other legal requirements issued, enacted,
adopted or promulgated by any Governmental Entities (the foregoing, each a "
_Law_ ") or Permit, in each case, applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) and
(iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

declarations, notices or filings set forth on _Section 3.03(b)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Delaware Secretary and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
the other jurisdictions in which Parent and the Company are qualified to do
business and (iii) such other matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.04 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

not misleading.

pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment

Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.06 _Brokers_ _'_ _Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's,

with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

 



 

Section 3.07 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. Since its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has neither
carried on any business nor conducted any operations other than the execution
of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters

Section 3.08 _Delaware General Corporation Law_. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub, nor any affiliate or associate of either of the foregoing, is, nor at any
time during the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of
the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. None of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, nor any controlling shareholders or members, general partners,
officers or directors of the foregoing, beneficially own (as such term is used
in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) more than one percent (1%)
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.09 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i)
one or more fully executed commitment letters and any related Redacted Fee
Letters (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the financial
institutions named therein, pursuant to which such financial institutions have
committed, upon the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth
therein, to provide the debt financing described therein in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) fully executed
commitment letters (each such letter, an " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ", and
collectively, the " _Equity Commitment Letters_ ") from funds Affiliated with
Leonard Green and Partners, L.P. (" _LGP_ ") and Hux Investment Pte. Ltd. ("
_Hux_ ") (each of LGP and Hux, an " _Investor_ ", and collectively, the "
_Investors_ "), pursuant to which the Investors have committed, upon the terms
and subject only to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the equity
financing described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter and, as the context requires,
any other debt commitment letter executed pursuant to _Section 5.06(c)_ are
hereinafter referred to together as the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "; and the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letters are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Commitment Letters_ ". The debt facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, together with any private
placement of unsecured notes (" _Notes_ ") to finance the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Notes Offering_ "), are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and the financing contemplated
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Equity Financing_ ". The financings contemplated pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letters, respectively, are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Financing_ ".

 



 

(b) The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, and to the Knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto (and the Company has been designated as a
third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters as provided therein)
and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against each of the
parties thereto, except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity. All commitment fees and
other fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid in full or will be
duly paid in full as and when due, and Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise
satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by
them pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the date
hereof. The Commitment Letters have not been amended, modified, withdrawn or
terminated in any respect on or prior to the date hereof, and no such
amendment, modification or termination is contemplated as of the date hereof
other than as would not require a consent or waiver of this Agreement. As of
the date hereof no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default by Parent or Merger Sub or
any of its Affiliates thereunder or otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. The consummation of the
Financing and the obligation of the parties under the Commitment Letters to
make the full amount of the Financing available to Parent at the Closing are
subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the
copies of the Commitment Letters delivered to the Company. Except as set forth
in _Section 3.09(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and except for the
Commitment Letters and the Redacted Fee Letter, as of the date hereof, there
are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to
the funding of the Financing. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing will not be satisfied or the Financing will not
be consummated and available in full on or before the date of the Closing. The
aggregate proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient to enable Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and to make all payments contemplated by this Agreement, including
payment of the Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness required as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and all
fees and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ and the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.03(a)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The equity investment by each Investor under its Equity Commitment
Letter is not subject to any condition other than the conditions set forth in
such Equity Commitment Letter. The provisions of this _Section 3.09_ shall not
result in a failure of a condition pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ if Parent is
capable of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date, notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 3.09_.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Solvency of the Surviving Company Following the Merger_. As
of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the
accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties of
the Company in this Agreement and material compliance by the Company with the
covenants contained in this Agreement and (iii) the most recent financial
forecasts of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries delivered to Parent have
been prepared in good faith, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, payment of all amounts to be paid
on the Closing Date, including the aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment
or refinancing of any Indebtedness in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Commitment Letters, if any, and payment
of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section
3.10_ , the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of such Person
will, as of such date, exceed the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors; (b) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date; and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or lines of credit, or a combination
thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete
copy of the duly executed guarantee of the Investors in the form attached as
_Exhibit_ _ D_ to this Agreement (the " _Guarantee_ "). The Guarantee is
valid and in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the respective Investors, enforceable against them in
accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of any Investor under the Guarantee.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Certain Arrangements_. Except (x) as set forth in _Section
3.12_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, (y) for the Rollover Agreement and (z)
for the Voting Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Contracts or commitments to enter into any Contract between Parent, Merger
Sub, the Investors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and (i) any
member of the Company's management or directors, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, on the other hand, pursuant to which such holder would
be entitled to receive in respect of the Merger consideration for its Company
Common Stock of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration, or
(iii) any stockholder of the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to which
such stockholder agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.13 _Acknowledgement by Parent and Merger Sub_.

 



 

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying and neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for the
representations and warranties in _Article IV_ , including the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,

well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, and that Parent and
Merger Sub will have no claim against any of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other person with respect thereto unless any such information is expressly
addressed or included in a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree
that none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, nor any other person, has
made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans unless any such information is expressly addressed or
included in a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_ or in any
certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other

publicly available after January 1, 2016 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") other than in any "risk
factor" disclosure, any "forward looking statements" or any other disclosures
which are similarly cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature;
__provided__ that nothing disclosed in such Filed Company SEC Documents shall
be deemed to be a qualification of or modification to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.03_ , _Section 4.05(c)_ and the first
sentence of _Section 4.08_ ), or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by

the Company Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the
case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such

be in good standing has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and

Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business in each

its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified has not had and would not

Company Board reasonably informing itself about such Alternative Proposal).

 



 

 



   



 

(v) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this _Section
5.04_ , it is agreed that in the event any Representative of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary takes any action, which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a material breach of this _Section 5.04(a)_ , and the Company does

their respective Representatives receives an Alternative Proposal (provided
that such Alternative Proposal does not result from any material breach of the
restrictions in this _Section 5.04_ ) by any Person or Group at any time prior

Representatives may, prior to (but not after) the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, take the actions set forth in subsections (i) and/or
(ii) of this _Section 5.04(c)_ if the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
has determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the
Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Alternative
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (i)
furnish non-public information to and afford access to the business,
employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any Person in response to such

Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the
Person or Group making any such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry), and the
Company shall as reasonably promptly as practicable (and in any event within
forty-eight (48) hours) provide to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry, if in writing; or (ii) a written summary of the material
terms of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if oral. Prior to providing any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(pursuant to _Section 5.04(c)_ ) to any other Person or Group in connection
with any such Alternative Proposal, the Company shall provide such non-public
information to Parent. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as
reasonably promptly as practicable with notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed on a current
basis in all material respects of all communications regarding (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments to) such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company Board may (i) solely in the case
of an Intervening Event or with respect to a Superior Proposal, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or take any action, or
make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (any of the foregoing being an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") (including, for the avoidance of doubt, recommending against the
Merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any Alternative Proposal) and
(ii) if the Company has received a Superior Proposal that does not result from
a material breach of this _Section 5.04_ (after taking into account the terms
of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.04(e)_ ), terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a definitive
written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change
as __provided__ in clause (i) above or, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ , unless:

 



 

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
(3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Parent of the circumstances giving rise to the
Adverse Recommendation Change, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that
the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of
such Superior Proposal and all other material transaction agreements and other
material documents relating to such Superior Proposal or, where no such copy
is available, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal);

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, and the
Guarantee so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board) a Superior
Proposal, or in cases not involving a Superior Proposal, the failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change (in the judgment of the Company Board after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
would no longer be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



 

(iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, and after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal or, in cases not involving a Superior Proposal, that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change continues to be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.04(e)_ with respect to such new written
notice.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Company's shareholders if the Company Board
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
__provided__ , __however__ , that in no event shall the Company Board effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.04(e)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, any public disclosure (other than any "stop, look
and listen" statement) by the Company or the Company Board relating to any
determination or other action by the Company Board or the Company with respect
to any Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on June 1, 2016 (the " _Go Shop Period_ "),
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives shall have the right to directly or indirectly: (i) initiate,
solicit and encourage, whether publicly or otherwise, Alternative Proposals
and Inquiries, including by way of providing access to non-public information
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements ( _ _provided__ that (x) prior to providing any non-public
information to any Person given such access, the Company shall provide such
non-public information to Parent and (y) in no event shall the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and Representatives
provide any Person any non-public information of or relating to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives); and (ii) enter
into, engage in, and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to
Alternative Proposals and Inquiries or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, efforts,
attempts, discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.04_ to the contrary, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit the Company Subsidiaries or its or
their Affiliates or Representatives to, reimburse or agree to reimburse the
fees or expenses of any Person in connection with an Alternative Proposal or
Inquiry (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

with respect to the consummation of the Debt Financing are set forth in
_Section 5.06_ ), (v) consummating the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letters (subject to the conditions set forth therein) at or
prior to the Closing and (vi) fully enforcing the obligations of the Investors
and their respective investment affiliates (and the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub) under the Equity Commitment Letters (subject to the conditions set
forth therein), including (at the request of the Company) by filing one or
more lawsuits against the Investors to fully enforce the Investors'
obligations (and the rights of Parent and the Merger Sub) thereunder.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree
to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term
of the Equity Commitment Letters in a manner adverse to the Company without
the prior written consent of the Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees
to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within one Business Day, if
at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any Equity Commitment Letter expires
or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person attempts or purports to
terminate any Equity Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or
purported termination is valid) or (ii) any Investor refuses to provide the
full Equity Financing on the terms set forth in its Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Debt Financing Commitments_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the
Debt Financing no later than the Closing Date, and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letters, if such amendment, modification or
waiver would:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate committed
amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount;

 



 

(ii) expand on or impose new or additional conditions precedent, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent, to the receipt of
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent, delay or impair the Closing,
(B) make the funding of such Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining such Debt Financing) less likely to occur, or (C) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 



 

(iii) otherwise reasonably be expected to make it less likely that the
Debt Financing would be funded or would otherwise prevent, delay or impair the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise adversely affect
(including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may (but shall not be
obligated to) amend the Debt Commitment Letters or Debt Financing Documents to
add commercial banks, investment banks or other institutional investors as
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
with commitments thereunder that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters
as of the date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably expected to prevent, delay
or impair the availability of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that
Parent and Merger Sub may enter into additional financing commitment letters
and other documents with respect to the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection with a Notes Offering.

 



 

Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate
the Debt Financing no later than the Closing Date, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(1) maintain in effect each Debt Commitment Letter;

 



 

(2) negotiate and enter into Debt Financing Documents consistent with the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or such other
terms that would not be prohibited by clauses (i) - (iii) in the immediately
preceding paragraph (it being agreed that documentation with respect to any
debt financing that is unsecured or subordinated shall not be required if the
Notes Offering is consummated on or prior to the Closing Date);

 



 

(3) comply with all covenants and agreements of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent a breach thereof would
result in a failure of a condition precedent to the Debt Financing or
otherwise make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur;

 



 

 



   



 

(4) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including by consummating
the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter) that are within
its control; and

 



 

(5) consummate the Debt Financing upon satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

In the event that all conditions precedent in a Debt Commitment Letter (other
than the availability of funding of any of the financing contemplated under
the Equity Commitment Letters) have been satisfied or, upon funding will be
satisfied, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letters to fund on
the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a
true and complete copy of any amendment, supplement, modification, replacement
or waiver of the Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents made prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed upon reasonable request, in
reasonable detail with respect to all material activity concerning the Debt
Financing (including status thereof), shall give the Company prompt notice if
it becomes aware of any material adverse change with respect to the
availability of Debt Financing and shall provide the Company copies of the
Debt Financing Documents and such other information and documentation
available to them as shall be reasonably requested by the Company for purposes
of monitoring the progress of the financing activities. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to notify the Company
promptly, if at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) a Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or
if any Person attempts or purports in writing to terminate a Debt Commitment
Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination is valid);

 



 

(ii) Parent or Merger Sub has actual knowledge of any breach or default by
any party to any Debt Commitment Letter; or

 



 

(iii) Parent or Merger Sub receives any written notice or other
communication from any Person with respect to any: (A) actual or potential
breach, default or termination by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or
(B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Debt
Commitment Letter regarding satisfaction of a condition precedent to the
availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.

 



 

 



   



 

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates
to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter
into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
prevent consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event will Parent or
Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject
to attorney-client privilege (provided that the Parent and Merger Sub shall
each use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege).

 



 

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Commitment Letter, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to arrange to
promptly obtain Debt Financing on terms (including conditions, structure,
covenants and pricing) not materially less beneficial to Parent, in an amount
that is sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
available, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent, the
Surviving Company and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, and all
payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain a new financing commitment
letter and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub
expressly acknowledges and agrees that, subject to _Section 9.10(b)_ , neither
the availability nor terms of the Debt Financing or any alternative Debt
Financing are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.

 



 

(d) Prior to or, to the extent applicable, concurrently with Closing, the
Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide (and to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide) Parent with such cooperation that is reasonably necessary
and customary in connection with the Debt Financing (including the financings
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters) as may be reasonably requested by
Parent. Such cooperation shall include commercially reasonable efforts in
respect of the following:

 



 

(i) participation in, and assistance with, as applicable, the Marketing
Efforts related to the Debt Financing;

 



 

(ii) delivery to Parent, Merger Sub and their Financing Sources of the
Financing Information and the Financing Deliverables as promptly as reasonably
practicable following Parent's request (or concurrently with the Closing to
the extent set forth in the definition of " _Financing Deliverables_ ");

 



 

(iii) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions
precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing that are within the Company's
control;

 



 

(iv) to cause its independent auditors to cooperate with the Debt
Financing, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Specified Auditor Assistance;

 



 

(v) upon reasonable request, to identify any material non-public
information contained in the Marketing Material and comply with Regulation FD
to the extent applicable to such material non-public information;

 



 

 



   



 

(vi) deliver such due diligence materials as are reasonably available to
it and as are reasonably requested by Parent and customarily delivered in
connection with the Marketing Materials; and

 



 

(vii) assist Parent with Parent's preparation of pro forma and projected
financial statements and financial information necessary to satisfy a
condition to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or
customarily included in Marketing Material; _provided_ , that, (a) neither the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of its and their respective
Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for information relating to
the proposed debt and equity capitalization of Parent or Merger Sub that may
be included in such pro forma and projected financial information and (b)
without limiting the assistance obligations set forth in this clause (vii),
Parent and Merger Sub will be primarily responsible for the preparation of any
such pro forma and projected financial information;

 



 

 _ _provided__ that (A) no agreement executed by the Company shall be
effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any such
agreement that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective
prior to the Effective Time ( _ _provided__ that the Company will execute
customary authorization letters required by the Financing Sources in
connection with the Debt Financing) and (B) the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.06(d)_ shall not require cooperation to the extent it would: (i)
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries; (ii) cause any condition to Closing set forth in
_Sections_ _ 7.01_ or _7.03_ to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any
breach of this Agreement (including any representations or warranties
thereunder); (iii) result in the Company or the Company Subsidiaries paying
any commitment or other fee prior to the Effective Time; (iv) cause the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur liability in connection with the
Financing prior to the Effective Time; (v) cause any director, officer or
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability (including that none of the boards of directors (or equivalent
bodies) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to enter
into any resolutions or take similar action approving the Financing until the
Closing has occurred); (vi) include any actions that Company reasonably
believes would result in the contravention of, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default under, any Laws
or under any material Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party in effect on the date hereof; (vii) require the Company to provide
access to or disclose information that the Company determines would jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or
would otherwise be restricted from disclosure in accordance with the proviso
in _Section 6.02_ ; (viii) require the delivery of any financial statements in
a form or subject to a standard different than those provided to Parent on or
prior to the date hereof or otherwise delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
require the Company to prepare separate financial statements for any Company
Subsidiary; (ix) involve approaching landlords or any other bailees or other
third parties prior to Closing to discuss landlord waivers, leasehold
mortgages, bailee waivers, estoppels or other agreements limiting the rights
of such third parties, (x) involve consenting to the filing of UCC-1s prior to
the Closing; or (xi) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to deliver
any legal opinions. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company obtained by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.06(d)_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; __provided__
that the Company agrees that Parent and Merger Sub may share non-public or
otherwise confidential information with the Financing Sources, and that
Parent, Merger Sub and such Financing Sources may share such information with
potential Financing Sources in connection with the Marketing Efforts relating
to the Debt Financing if the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements, including "click through" confidentiality
agreements and confidentially provisions contained in customary bank books and
offering memoranda provided that the Company has had an opportunity to review
such confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions and such
agreements or provisions provide confidentiality obligations under Regulation
FD. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this
_Section 5.06(d)_ and _Section 2.02(k)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Affiliates and its Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters and
any information utilized in connection therewith, and the delivery of the
payoff letters pursuant to _Section 2.02(k)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the condition set forth in _Section 7.03(b)_ , as it applies to the
Company's obligations under this _Section 5.06(d)_ , shall be deemed satisfied
unless there has occurred a knowing and willful material breach of its
obligations under this _Section 5.06(d)_. The Company hereby consents to the
use of all of its and the Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the
Debt Financing, in accordance with customary practice and subject to any
reasonable restrictions that the Company may impose; provided that the logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to
harm or disparage the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation
or the goodwill of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

clears the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company

through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give the
Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") at the Company
Shareholders Meeting and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, in each case, except to the extent that the Company Board shall
have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 5.04(e)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees

material respect with the normal business operations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary); __provided__ , __however__ , that the Company shall not
be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it

that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure); (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _ _provided__ that the

the other hand, are adverse parties. All information exchanged pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated

party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with

sensitive material to be provided to the other under this _Section 6.03(b)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors or other representatives of the recipient unless express

(after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting required in connection
with the Merger pursuant to an outstanding Company Stock Option agreement on
the date hereof) Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and, for each such
Company Stock Option with respect to which the option holder has executed an
Award Release Agreement, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash payable at the time of cancellation of such Company Stock
Option equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (y) the Merger
Consideration over (z) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option (less any required withholding under applicable
Tax Law) (collectively, the " _Option Payments_ "). As soon as practicable
following the Closing and within three (3) Business Days following the receipt
of a duly executed Award Release Agreement, the Surviving Company shall make
the Option Payments, if any, due to each holder of a Company Stock Option by a
special payroll payment through the payroll system of the Surviving Company
(or an Affiliate thereof). From and after the Effective Time, each such vested

thereof, and shall only entitle such holder to the Option Payment, if any.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall timely take all necessary or
appropriate actions to cause the Company Stock Options to be canceled at the
Closing in exchange for the Option Payments (including, to the extent
applicable, the distribution of applicable notices as required by the Company
Stock Plan) in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan).

 



 

(b) _Other Vested_ _Company_ _Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
vested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting required in
connection with the Merger pursuant to an outstanding Company Restricted Share
agreement or Company RSU Award agreement on the date hereof) Company
Restricted Share or Company RSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the

Agreement shall become fully vested so as to no longer be subject to any
forfeiture or vesting requirements and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
considered an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of this
Agreement and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto, less any required withholding under
applicable Tax Law. As soon as practicable following the Closing and in any
event within three (3) Business Days following the receipt of a duly executed
Award Release Agreement, the Surviving Company shall pay the Merger
Consideration with respect to the vested Company Restricted Shares or Company
RSU Awards to the relevant holder by a special payroll payment and withhold

thereof.

 



 

(c) _Unvested Company Stock Awards_.

and Company RSU Award agreement) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be canceled and each holder thereof who has executed an
Award Release Agreement shall be entitled to receive: (1) with respect to each
cancelled Company Stock Option held by the holder, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (y) the Merger Consideration over
(z) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by
(B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (less any required withholding under applicable Tax Law) (collectively,
the " _Unvested Option Payments_ "); and (2) with respect to each cancelled
Company Restricted Share and/or Company RSU Award held by the holder, an

applicable Tax Law) (collectively, the " _Unvested Restricted Share/RSU
Payments_ "); __provided__ , __however__ , such Unvested Option Payments and
Unvested Restricted Share/RSU Payments shall be held in the Escrow Account in
accordance with _Section 2.04_ and _Section 6.05(c)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) If the holder remains employed with the Surviving Company until the
date(s) that the unvested portion(s) of the Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Share and Company RSU Award would have vested had they not been
cancelled at the Effective Time, then on such date(s) the Surviving Company
(or an Affiliate thereof) shall pay from the Escrow Account through its
payroll system the portion of the Option Payments, Restricted Share and/or RSU
Payments that would have been paid to such holder in accordance with _Section
6.04(a)_ and/or _6.04(b)_ if such unvested portion had been vested immediately
before the Effective Time. If the holder's employment with the Surviving
Company is terminated by the Surviving Company without cause before all
Unvested Option Payments and Unvested Restricted Share/RSU Payments have been
paid to the holder, the Surviving Company will pay to the holder within thirty
(30) days following such termination of employment a lump sum payment equal to
all such unpaid payments.

extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each
Company Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as an officer or director of
the Company or a Company Subsidiary against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Company
Indemnified Party as an officer or director of a Company or a Company
Subsidiary in connection with any pending or threatened Law based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Company Indemnified
Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether

(15) days after receipt by the Surviving Company of a written request for such
advance, subject to the execution by such Company Indemnified Parties of
appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such
advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 6.05_.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall

Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in

less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no
event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than three hundred
percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 6.05(d)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
the years within such six (6) year period for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of
such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option
(following reasonable consultation with Parent), purchase a "tail" directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance
policy for the Company and its current and former directors, officers and
employees who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage
and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_
that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one
policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Company shall maintain

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this

reimbursement obligations under _Section 5.06(d)_ , this _Section 8.02_ ,
_Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in _Section
8.03(e)_ , no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability or
damages for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an
act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the
taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected
to, cause or constitute a material breach of this Agreement; it being

consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the
applicable conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which
conditions would be capable of being satisfied at such time) shall constitute
a willful breach of this Agreement.

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are

publicly withdrawn at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Company

within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive Contract to consummate any Alternative Proposal and such
Alternative Proposal is later consummated (whether or not during such twelve
(12)-month period); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ , the references to 20% in the definition of

termination fee of Ninety-Four Million Dollars ($94,000,000.00) (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "). Any Parent Termination Fee due shall be paid to the
Company by wire transfer of same-day funds promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) after the date of termination of this Agreement. In no
event shall Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

consultants incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount not
to exceed $10,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "); __provided__ that any
payment of the Parent Expenses shall not affect Parent's right to receive any
Termination Fee otherwise due under Section _8.03(a)(ii)_ in respect of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , but shall reduce, on a dollar
for dollar basis, any Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under
Section _8.03(a)(ii)_ in respect of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to timely pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ ,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a Judgment in
its favor, such paying party shall pay to the other party or parties, as
applicable, its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, action
or other proceeding, together with interest on the amount of such payment from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ on the date such interest begins accruing. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the parties agree that:

 



 

(i) In the event that the Parent Termination Fee is payable and paid to
the Company in accordance with this _Section 8.03_ , (A) the receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee, together with any indemnification or reimbursement
owed pursuant to _Section 5.06(d)_ (" _Recoverable Amounts_ "), shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and shareholders with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby or any matter forming the basis for
such termination against Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective
former, current or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management
companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all
former, current or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors,

foregoing, and any and all former, current or future heirs, executors,

Financing Source and each Affiliate, officer, director, employee, controlling

(each, a " _Parent Related Party_ "), (B) no Parent Related Party shall have
any other liability or obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
(C) neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any Commitment
Letter or the Guarantee, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination, except in the cases of clauses
(A), (B) and (C) for (X) the obligations of Parent under the Confidentiality
Agreement and (Y) the Recoverable Amounts, which in the case of each Parent
Related Party, shall be subject to the limitations of liability provided in
the Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 9.10_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 8.03_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and the Parent
Termination Fee.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) In the event that the Termination Fee is payable and paid to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 8.03_ , the receipt of the Termination Fee
(together with any reimbursement owed pursuant to _Section 8.03(d)_ or this

exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this

Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the Company's shareholders

part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

an adequate remedy for any such breach.

Sources have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if a decree or order of specific
performance or other equitable relief is granted, then it would take such

Section 9.12 _Exculpation of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Company, on behalf of itself and the Company
Related Parties, hereby (i) acknowledges that none of the Financing Sources
(and/or any of their Affiliates and/or their or their Affiliates' officers,
directors, employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys or
representatives) shall have any liability to the Company or any Company
Related Party under this Agreement or for any claim made by the Company or any

directors, employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys or
representatives) relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iii) agrees not to commence
(and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to
assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any Financing
Source (and/or any of their Affiliates and/or their or their Affiliates'
officers, directors, employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents,
attorneys or representatives) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. With respect to any dispute or proceeding relating to this Section
9.12 or any other dispute involving the Financing Sources, the Company, on
behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties, (w) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or federal courts of the
United States of America, in each case, sitting in the borough of Manhattan,
and any appellate court from any thereof (the courts described in this clause
(w), the "Applicable Courts"), and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such litigation may be heard and determined only in an Applicable Court, (x)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any proceeding in any
Applicable Court, (y) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any
Applicable Court, and (z) agrees that a final judgment in any such proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 9.12
will limit the rights of Parent or Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party in
respect of the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto.
Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source shall be subject to any
special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious

incidence of ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. All rights,
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall

Section 5.04 of the Merger Agreement; _provided_ , the foregoing shall not
serve to limit or restrict any actions taken by the Stockholder in any

Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 



 

(b) _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
of any other party's obligations to comply with its representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder (or any delay in
asserting any such breach) shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder or
in any other context.

 



 

(c) _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance, is to be held invalid or

upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not be deemed to, confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their

specific terms hereof, and that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at law or in
equity. The Stockholder agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to enforce the
covenants and obligations contained herein on the basis that Parent has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and Parent shall not be
required to post a bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 



 

(g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance and any action or proceeding (whether
in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) arising out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by, and

consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction the Court of Chancery

any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware for the
purpose of any suit, action or proceeding (whether, in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.

 



 

(i) _Waiver Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST

PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13(I)_.

 



 

(j) _No Agreement Until Transaction Documents Executed_. Irrespective of
negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not constitute, or be deemed to evidence, a contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto unless (i)
the Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties thereto and (ii)
this Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

 



 

(k) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and

GUARANTEE

 



 

THIS GUARANTEE, dated as of April 26, 2016 (this " _Guarantee_ "), by Green
Equity Investors VI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Green Equity
Investors Side VI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Hux Investment
Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private limited company (collectively, the "
_Guarantors_ " and each a " _Guarantor_ ") is in favor of ExamWorks Group,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

1. _GUARANTEE_. To induce the Company to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time pursuant to the terms thereof, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Gold Parent, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "), Gold Merger Co, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company, pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), each Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally, on a several (not joint and several) basis, guarantees to the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the due and punctual performance and discharge of such Guarantor's respective percentage as set forth opposite its name in _Annex 1_ (for each such Guarantor, its " _Guaranteed Percentage_ ") of the payment obligations and liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub to the Company under the fourth to last and third to last sentences of Section 5.06, Section 8.03(c) and Section 8.03(e) of the Merger Agreement, and the obligations in the last sentence of this _Section_ _1_ (the " _Obligations_ "), provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guarantee, in no event shall each Guarantor's aggregate liability exceed such Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of $94,000,000.00 (such limitation on the liability each Guarantor may have for its Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations being herein referred to as such Guarantor's " _Cap_ "), and the Company agrees that this Guarantee may not be enforced against any Guarantor without giving effect to such Guarantor's Cap (and to the provisions of _Sections_ _8_ and _9_ hereof). All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

If Parent or Merger Sub fails to pay any Obligations when due, then each
Guarantor's liabilities to the Company hereunder in respect of such
Obligations shall, at the Company's option, become immediately due and payable
and the Company may at any time and from time to time, at the Company's
option, and so long as Parent or Merger Sub has failed to discharge its
Obligations, take any and all actions available hereunder to collect any of
the Guarantor's liabilities hereunder in respect of such Obligations, subject
to such Guarantor's Cap. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Guarantor
acknowledges that the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute
a separate action or actions against such Guarantor for the full amount of
such Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations (subject to such
Guarantor's Cap) regardless of whether any action is brought against Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Guarantor.

 



 

Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub, the Company shall have the rights and remedies specified in the
Merger Agreement and (b) with respect to such Guarantor, the Company shall
have the rights and remedies specified in this Guarantee and the Equity
Commitment Letters (including, for the avoidance of doubt, its rights as a
third-party beneficiary contained therein).

 



 

 



   



 

If any Guarantor fails to timely satisfy its Guaranteed Percentage of the
Obligations, and, in order to obtain such satisfaction, the Company commences
a suit which results in a judgment against such Guarantor for such
satisfaction, such Guarantor shall pay the Company its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such Guaranteed
Percentage of the Obligations at the prime rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received.

 



 

2. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. Each Guarantor's liability hereunder is absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Merger Agreement that may be agreed to by Parent or Merger Sub. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, each Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations (subject to such Guarantor's Cap) as if such payment had not been made. This Guarantee is an unconditional and continuing guarantee of payment and not of collection, and the Company shall not be required to proceed against Parent or Merger Sub before proceeding against the Guarantors hereunder.

 



 

3. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATION, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. Each Guarantor agrees that the Company may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of such Guarantor, extend the time of payment of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Parent or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or affecting such Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Guarantee. Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations or liabilities of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by, and shall be absolute and irrespective of, (a) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations, or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation, or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement or the Commitment Letters made in accordance with the terms thereof or in any other agreement to which the Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub is a party and which evidences, secures or is otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (c) (i) the addition, substitution or release of any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Obligations or (ii) the release or discharge of the other Guarantor, or the receipt by the Company of partial satisfaction of the Obligations from the other Guarantor; (d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor or any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any other Guarantor); (e) the existence of any claim, set off or other right which (i) any Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (ii) Parent or Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company, in each case described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 3(e)_ (A) whether in connection with any Obligations or otherwise and (B) except as contemplated by the final sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph or, solely with respect to clause (ii) of this _Section_ _3_ (e), in the Merger Agreement; (f) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the Obligations; (g) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent, Merger Sub, any other Guarantor or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any of their respective assets; (h) the value, genuineness, validity, illegality or enforceability according to their terms of the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letters or any agreement or instrument referred to herein, except as contemplated by the final sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph or (i) any discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of applicable law or equity (other than as a result of, and to the extent of, payment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or as a result of defenses to the payment of the Obligations that would be available to Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any applicable law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company. Each Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the Obligation incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium or other similar applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of one or more of Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor, or any other Person liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than actual fraud on Parent by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contractual defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to Parent under the Merger Agreement). Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers, agreements, covenants, obligations and other terms in this Guarantee are knowingly made and agreed to in contemplation of such benefits. Each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees, on a several (not joint and several) basis, that it (x) shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates to not, assert, directly or indirectly, in any proceeding that this Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, (y) shall maintain in full force and effect all consents of any Governmental Entity or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Guarantee and will obtain any such consents that may become necessary in the future, and (z) will comply in all respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure to so comply would impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Guarantee. 

 



 

 



   



 

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives any rights that it may now have
or hereafter acquire against Parent or Merger Sub that arise from the
existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations
under or in respect of this Guarantee or any other agreement in connection
therewith, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or
remedy of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law,
including the right to take or receive from Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, and each
Guarantor shall not exercise any such rights unless and until all Obligations
shall have been paid in full in immediately available funds. If any amount
shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding
sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in immediately available
funds of all Obligations, such amount shall be received and held in trust for
the benefit of the Company, shall be segregated from other property and funds
of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be promptly paid or delivered to the
Company in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or
assignment). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Guarantee or otherwise, the Company hereby agrees that each Guarantor shall
have all defenses to the payment of its obligations under this Guarantee
(which in any event shall be subject to such Guarantor's Cap) that would be
available to Parent and/or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement with respect
to the Obligations, as well as any defenses in respect of any actual fraud of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than defenses arising from the
bankruptcy or insolvency of Parent or Merger Sub).

 



 

The Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all
dealings between Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to
have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. When pursuing
its rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantors, the Company shall be
under no obligation to pursue such rights and remedies it may have against
Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person for the Obligations or any right of
offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Company to pursue such
other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent or Merger Sub
or any such other Person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of
offset, and any release by the Company of Parent or Merger Sub or any such
other Person or any right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantors of any
liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies,
whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Company.

 



 

The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any
Obligation in the event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure
of the Company to so file shall not affect the Guarantors' obligations
hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of any
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever, each Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such
Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations (subject to such
Guarantor's Cap) as if such payment had not been made.

 



 

4. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder under the Merger Agreement. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed it by Law shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Company's rights against, Parent, Merger Sub, any other Guarantor or any other Person now or hereafter liable for any Obligation or interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to proceeding against any of the Guarantors.

 



 

 



   



 

5. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants, on a several (not joint and several) basis, that:

 



 

(a) It is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization; it has all requisite power and authority to

Guarantor or its assets; and the Person executing and delivering this
Guarantee on behalf of such Guarantor is duly authorized to do so;

 



 

(b) all consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with and
notifications to, any Governmental Entity necessary for the due execution,

no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Entity
is required by such Guarantor in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Guarantee by such Guarantor;

 



 

(c) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its
terms, subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar applicable Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and

 



 

(d) such Guarantor has and will have (except in the case of Hux Investment
Pte. Ltd., which only will have) the financial capacity to pay and perform its
obligations under, in respect of or in connection with this Guarantee when
such obligations become due and payable, and all funds necessary for such
Guarantor to fulfill such obligations shall be available to such Guarantor (or
its permitted assignee pursuant to _Section_ _6_ hereof) when or for so long
as any such obligations become due and payable.

 



 

6. _NO ASSIGNMENT_. Neither this Guarantee nor any right or obligation hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any party (by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Company (in the case of an assignment or delegation by one or more Guarantors) or the Guarantors (in the case of an assignment or delegation by the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that each Guarantor may assign or delegate all or part of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Company, to any other Guarantor, or other Person to which it has allocated all or a portion of its investment commitment to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment or delegation shall relieve such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder as a primary obligor. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void.

 



 

7. _NOTICES_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be given by the means specified in the Merger Agreement (and shall be deemed given as specified therein), as follows:

8. _CONTINUING GUARANTEE_. With respect to each Guarantor, this Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on such Guarantor, its successors and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company and its respective successors and permitted assigns until such Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations (which shall be subject to such Guarantor's Cap) have been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else express or implied in this Guarantee or otherwise, with respect to each Guarantor, this Guarantee shall terminate and such Guarantor shall have no further obligations under or in connection with this Guarantee as of the earliest of (i) the Effective Time if, and only if, the Closing occurs and the Merger Consideration is paid, (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms in circumstances where none of the Obligations are payable, (iii) the date that is fifteen (15) months following the date hereof unless a claim for payment of such Guarantor's liability hereunder in respect of any of the Obligations is brought pursuant to and in accordance with this Guarantee prior to such date, in which case this Guarantee shall terminate upon the final, non-appealable resolution of such action and satisfaction by such Guarantor of any obligations finally determined or agreed to be owed by such Guarantor, consistent with the terms hereof, and (iv) receipt by the Company of the payment in full of such Guarantor's Guaranteed Percentage of the Obligations (subject to such Guarantor's Cap). Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Guarantee, or anything express or implied in this Guarantee or otherwise, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserts in any litigation or other proceeding (a) that the provisions of _Section _ _1_ hereof limiting any Guarantor's liability to its respective Cap or the provisions of this _Section_ _8_ or _Section_ _9_ hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, (b) that any Guarantor is liable in respect of Obligations in excess of or to a greater extent than its Cap, or (c) any claim against any Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party (as defined in _Section_ _9_ ) with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters (except as provided in Section 5(ii) or 5(iii) thereof), this Guarantee or any other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters or this Guarantee, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than Retained Claims (as defined in _Section_ _9_ hereof) asserted by the Company against the Non-Recourse Parties pursuant to _Section_ _9_ , then (x) the obligations of the Guarantors under or in connection with this Guarantee shall terminate _ab initi_ _o_ and shall thereupon be null and void, (y) if any Guarantor has previously made any payments under or in connection with this Guarantee, it shall be entitled to recover such payments from the Company, and (z) neither the Guarantors nor any other Non-Recourse Party shall have any liability whatsoever (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) to the Company or any other Person in any way under or with respect to this Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letters or the Merger Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters or under this Guarantee.

 



 

9. _NO RECOURSE_. Other than with respect to any Retained Claim (as hereinafter defined), the Company acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no Person other than the Guarantors (and the legal successors and assigns of their obligations hereunder) shall have any obligations under or in connection with this Guarantee notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantors may be partnerships or limited liability companies, (b) the Guarantors shall have no obligations under or in connection with this Guarantee except as expressly provided by this Guarantee, (c) Parent has no assets other than the Equity Commitment Letters and (d) no personal liability shall attach to, and no recourse shall be had by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person purporting to claim by or through any of them or for the benefit of any of them under any theory of liability (including without limitation by attempting to pierce a corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, or attempting otherwise to avoid or disregard the entity form of any Non-Recourse Party, whether by theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, unfairness undercapitalization or otherwise, by attempting to compel Parent or Merger Sub to enforce any rights that they may have against any Person, by attempting to enforce any assessment, or by attempting to enforce any purported right at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) against any Non-Recourse Party (as hereinafter defined) in any way under or in connection with this Guarantee, the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, or any other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with this Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letters, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise). The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not, institute any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, this Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the Equity Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated thereby (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise), against any Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party except for claims that the Company may assert: (i) against any Non-Recourse Party that is party or subject to, and solely pursuant to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement; (ii) against a Guarantor (and its legal successors and assigns of its obligations hereunder) under, and pursuant to the terms of, this Guarantee (subject in each case to each such Guarantor's Cap); (iii) against a Guarantor for specific performance of such Guarantor's obligation under each Equity Commitment Letter to fund its commitment thereunder in accordance with and pursuant to Section 5(ii) or 5(iii) thereof; and (iv) against Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the claims described in clauses (i) through (iv) collectively, the " _Retained Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a Guarantor (x) consolidates with or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (y) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person such that the sum of any Guarantor's remaining net assets is less than the amount of the Cap and the transferee thereof does not assume, directly or indirectly, such Guarantor's obligations hereunder, then, and in each such case, the Company may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of any judgment, order, decree or assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, against such continuing or surviving Person (in either case, a " _Successor_ "), as the case may be, but only to the extent of such Guarantor's unpaid liability hereunder up to such Guarantor's Cap and subject to the other limitations expressly set forth herein.

10. _GOVERNING LAW_. This Guarantee, including all matters of construction, validity and performance and any action or proceeding (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) arising out of this Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws of the state of Delaware. 

 



 

11. _SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION_. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware for the purpose of any suit, action or proceeding (whether, in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) relating to this Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Person with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section_ _7_.

EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTEE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ _12_.

 



 

13. _COUNTERPARTS AND SIGNATURE_. This Guarantee may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

 



 

 



   



 

14. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of _Section_ _9_ which reference Non-Recourse Parties (each of which shall be for the benefit of and enforceable by each Non-Recourse Party), this Guarantee is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

15. _CONFIDENTIALITY_. This Guarantee shall be treated as confidential and is being provided to the Company solely in connection with the Merger.

16. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 



 

(a) This Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
hereto and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or among the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically
disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements or
representations to the extent not embodied in this Guarantee. No amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision hereof shall be enforceable unless
approved by the Company and the Guarantors in writing.

 



 

(b) Any term or provision of this Guarantee that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the limitation of the
amount payable by any Guarantor hereunder to its Cap provided in _Section_ _1_
hereof and to the provisions of _Sections_ _8_ and _9_ hereof.

 



 

(c) When reference is made in this Guarantee to a Section, such reference
shall be to a Section of this Guarantee, unless otherwise indicated. The
headings contained in this Guarantee are for convenience of reference only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Guarantee.

by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party hereto. Whenever the context
may require, any pronouns used in this Guarantee shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of

any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Guarantee, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
