Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(a) Buyer will not assume any Company Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing, whether or not then exercisable. Each Qualifying
Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Closing will, by virtue of the Transactions and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Company Option Plan, and without any further action on the part of any
Optionholder, terminate and be cancelled and immediately cease to have any

3 (c) As soon as practicable following the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company

Company Stock issuable upon exercise thereof, an amount in cash equal to the
Per Share Option Consideration Amount, less the per share exercise price of
such Company Option, less applicable withholdings and payroll Taxes.

(d) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken, all
actions (i) necessary to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and (ii) necessary to terminate the

this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Warrants_.

 

(a) Each Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Closing (whether vested or unvested) will, by virtue of the
Transactions and pursuant to this Agreement and the Warrant Cancellation
Agreement, and without any further action on the part of Buyer, the Company or
any Warrantholder, terminate and be cancelled and, to the extent that
such Warrantholder has entered into a Warrant Cancellation Agreement, such
Warrantholder shall have the right to receive with respect to each share of
Company Stock issuable upon exercise thereof, an amount in cash (less Tax
withholdings required by applicable Law) equal to the Per Share Consideration
Amount, less the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant (subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_). The aggregate amount paid or
payable to holders of the Company Warrants pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.4(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Warrant Consideration._ "

 

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken, all
actions, to provide all notice that may be necessary (under the Company
Warrants or applicable Laws) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 2.4_ and to ensure that there shall be no outstanding securities,
commitments or agreements as of the Closing that purport to obligate the
Company to issue any shares of Company Stock, options to purchase shares of
Company Stock, warrants to purchase shares of Company Stock or other
securities under any circumstances, except as expressly contemplated hereby. 

Section 2.5 _Consideration_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Statement_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a balance sheet of
the Company setting forth the estimated financial condition of the Company as
of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Estimated Balance Sheet_ "), and calculations derived therefrom,
including (i) the estimated Indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the lesser of (A) the estimated Cash as of the end of
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Cash Amount_
") and (B) $2,500,000, (iii) the estimated aggregate amount of unpaid
Transaction Expenses, (iv) the estimated aggregate amount of unpaid Change of
Control Liabilities and (v) the Estimated Cash Consideration (such balance
sheet and estimates, collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Statement_"), and such
related worksheets, 

 



4  working papers, schedules and other supporting data in form, substance and
line item detail as Buyer may reasonably request. The Estimated Balance Sheet
shall set forth in line item detail the components of the Estimated
Indebtedness and shall calculate the Estimated Indebtedness in accordance with
the classifications and methodology set forth on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Sample
Indebtedness Calculation_ "). The Estimated Balance Sheet shall be based upon
the records of the Company and other information then available and shall be
prepared consistently with the Financial Statements and the Accounting
Principles; _provided_ , _however_ , that if and to the extent there is any
inconsistency between the methodology set forth in the Sample Indebtedness
Calculation, on the one hand, and either the Financial Statements or the
Accounting Principles, on the other hand, the Sample Indebtedness
Calculation shall control (the foregoing two sentences, the " _Methodology_
"). The Pre-Closing Statement shall control solely for purposes of determining
the Estimated Cash Consideration and shall not limit or otherwise affect
Buyers rights or remedies under this Agreement (or otherwise) or constitute
an acknowledgment, consent, waiver or estoppel by or of Buyer with respect to
the accuracy thereof. The Company shall provide Buyer and
its representatives, prior to Closing, reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice to the records of the Company and
such information used to prepare the Estimated Balance Sheet and the Companys
personnel in order to allow Buyer to verify the Estimated Balance Sheet for
purposes of Closing.

(b) _Estimated Cash Consideration_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer at
the Closing in connection with the Transactions is equal to: (i) Five Hundred
Million Dollars ($500,000,000), _minus_  (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness,
_plus_ (iii) Estimated Cash Amount _minus_ (iv) the estimated aggregate amount
of unpaid Transaction Expenses _minus_ (v) the estimated aggregate amount of
unpaid Change of Control Liabilities. The sum of clauses (i) through (v) of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Cash
Consideration._ "

Section 2.8 _Determination of Adjustment Amount_

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_,
the Estimated Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as follows: (A) reduced by
the amount, if any, by which the Closing Cash Consideration is less than the
Estimated Cash Consideration or (B) increased by the amount by which the
Closing Cash Consideration is greater than Estimated Cash Consideration. The
amount of such increase or decrease to the Estimated Cash Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_, and subject to the remainder of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, is referred to herein as the " _Adjustment
Amount._ "

(b) Within seventy five (75) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Committee a statement (the "
_Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth its calculation of: (i) the actual
Indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "); (ii) the
lesser of (A) the actual Cash as of the end of the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Closing Cash Amount_ ") and (B) $2,500,000, (iii) the
actual unpaid Transaction Expenses, (iv) the actual unpaid Change of Control
Liabilities and (v) the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Statement shall set
forth in line item detail the components of each of the foregoing items, and
shall calculate the Closing Indebtedness in accordance with the Methodology.
During the thirty (30) days immediately following Buyers delivery of the
Adjustment Statement, the Stockholders Committee and the Stockholders
Committees accountants shall have reasonable access to the working papers
and books and records relating to the Adjustment Statement; _provided_ , that
any such access or furnishing of such information shall be conducted at the
Stockholders Committees sole expense, during normal business hours under
the reasonable supervision of Buyer and in such a manner as not to interfere
in any material respect with the normal operations of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) and upon reasonable advance notice; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Stockholders Committee shall treat all such
information as confidential consistent with the provisions hereof, and hereby
waives any right to use such information for any purpose other than
in connection with the determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, and hereby agrees to execute and deliver such
customary waivers, limitations of liability and indemnification agreements as
are requested

 



9  by Buyers advisors to provide access to such work papers and records. The
Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
earlier of: (A) the date that the Stockholders Committee provides written
notice of its acceptance of Buyer-provided Adjustment Statement, or (B) the
end of the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt thereof by the Stockholders
Committee unless the Stockholders Committee gives written notice of its
disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer on or prior to such
date ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders Committee may so object
to the Adjustment Statement based only on the existence of factual, legal or
mathematical errors therein or on the failure of the Adjustment Statement to
be prepared in accordance with the principles set forth herein and in
accordance with the Methodology), or (C) resolution of the Notice of
Disagreement per subsection (c) below (upon any such final and binding events
under (A), (B) or (C) above, thereby a " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " and
the amount shown thereby, the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "). Any Notice of
Disagreement shall (x) specify in reasonable detail, and on a line item by
line item basis, the disputed items and the nature and amount of any
disagreement so asserted (the " _Disputed Items_ "), (y) an alternative
amount for each such Disputed Item and (z) shall include a proposed
calculation by the Stockholders Committee of the Closing Cash Amount, the
Closing Indebtedness, unpaid Transaction Expenses, unpaid Change of Control
Liabilities and the Adjustment Amount.

(c) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the
Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
earlier of (i) the date Buyer and the Stockholders Committee resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to all Disputed Items and (ii)
the date all remaining Disputed Items are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_. During the thirty (30)
days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer
and the Stockholders Committee shall consult in good faith to resolve in
writing any remaining Disputed Items. During such consultation period, Buyer
shall have full access to the books and records of the Stockholders
Committee and the working papers of the Stockholders Committees accountants
prepared in connection with the Stockholders Committees preparation of the
Notice of Disagreement; _provided_ , that any such access shall be conducted
at Buyers sole expense, during normal business hours under the reasonable
supervision of the Stockholders Committee.

 

(d) At the end of such thirty (30) day consultation period, if Buyer and the
Stockholders Committee have not resolved all Disputed Items, Buyer and the
Stockholders Committee shall submit any and all Disputed Items which remain
unresolved to, upon mutual agreement of Buyer and the Stockholders Committee,
an independent accounting firm experienced in auditing companies the size and
nature of the Company as mutually selected by Buyer and the Stockholders
Committee (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall work to
resolve such Disputed Items promptly and, in any event, within thirty (30)
days from the date the dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm. Any item
relating to the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, unpaid
Transaction Expenses, unpaid Change of Control Liabilities and the Adjustment
Amount that is not a Disputed Item specifically referred to the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_ shall be deemed final and
binding on the parties (as set forth in the Adjustment Statement or as
otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties). The Accounting Firm shall
finalize the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, unpaid Transaction
Expenses, unpaid Change of Control Liabilities and the Adjustment Amount by
selecting with respect to each Disputed Item an amount between or equal to
Buyers position as set forth in the Adjustment Statement or the Stockholders
Committees position as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine the Closing Cash
Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, unpaid Transaction Expenses, unpaid Change
of Control Liabilities and the Adjustment Amount with respect to each Disputed
Item submitted to the Accounting Firm, based solely on presentations by Buyer
and the Stockholders Committee

 



10  (and not by independent review). The determination of the Closing Cash
Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, unpaid Transaction Expenses, unpaid Change
of Control Liabilities and the Adjustment Amount with respect to each
Disputed Item by the Accounting Firm shall be binding on the parties and shall
be non-appealable.

 

(e) All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in connection with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall be paid by the party against whom the majority of
the dollar value of the Disputed Items so submitted was resolved, as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm.

 

(f) Upon the achievement of a Final Adjustment Statement and concomitant Final
Adjustment Amount, then the following shall occur:

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount results in an increase to the Estimated
Cash Consideration, then Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within seven
(7) days thereof) make (or cause to be made) a payment to the Stockholders
Committee for further payment to the Stockholders and Warrantholder, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Stockholders Committee an aggregate amount equal to such increase.

 

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount results in a decrease to the Estimated
Cash Consideration (the difference, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), the
Stockholders and the Warrantholder (or the Stockholders Committee on behalf
of the Stockholders and the Warrantholder), in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, shall promptly (but in any event within seven (7)
days thereof) make (or cause to be made) a payment by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds to the account designated by
Buyer in such election of an aggregate amount equal to the Shortfall Amount.

 

Section 2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as Buyer or the Company is required (even though the proposed
recipient may have provided any affidavits or certificates incident thereto)
to deduct and withhold with respect to any such payments under the Code or
any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Persons in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, any compensatory payments contemplated to be made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be directed to the Company to be paid through its
payroll to the appropriate Person (without interest and less any applicable
withholding Taxes).

Section 2.10  _Stockholders_ __ _Committee_ _; Expense Fund_.

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the execution of this Agreement, the
Stockholders irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint Ron Antevy and
Jonathan Antevy, acting jointly as the Stockholders Committee, as the agent
and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Stockholders, with full power of
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Stockholders for the
purposes set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_.

 

(b) _Authority_. The Stockholders grant to the Stockholders Committee full
authority to (i) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of
them (in their name or otherwise) any and all documents that the Stockholders
Committee may, in their sole reasonable

 



11  discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such
forms and containing such provisions as the Stockholders Committee may, in
their sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing their
duties as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.10(a)_, (ii) receive all notices
or other documents given or to be given to the Stockholders by Buyer or the
Company pursuant to this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, (iii)
receive and accept service of legal process in connection with any Proceeding
against the Stockholders or the Company arising under this Agreement or any
Transaction Documents, (iv) undertake, compromise, defend, settle, and deal
in any way with any Proceeding hereunder on behalf of the Stockholders as a
group or any Stockholder arising under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, (v) engage special counsel, accountants and other advisors and
incur such other expenses in connection with any of the Transactions, whether
before, at, or after the Closing, (vi) consent to the settlement of any
disputes in connection with _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ and (vii) take such other
action as the Stockholders Committee may deem appropriate, including: (A)
agreeing on behalf of the Stockholders or any of them to any waiver,
modification or amendment of this Agreement or any Transaction Document and
executing and delivering an agreement of such waiver, modification or
amendment and (B) all such other matters as the Stockholders Committee may
deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intents and purposes of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in
connection with the Transactions, Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Stockholder by the Stockholders
Committee, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of
any Stockholder by the Stockholders Committee, as fully binding upon such
Stockholder.

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Stockholders recognize and intend that the power
of attorney granted in _Section_ __ _ 2.10(a)_: (i) is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Stockholders
Committee (provided that such delegation is reasonably acceptable to Buyer);
and (iii) shall survive the death or incapacity of any such Person.

(d) _Replacement_. If either of the Persons serving as the Stockholders
Committee shall resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill their
responsibilities hereunder, the Stockholders shall (by consent of those
Persons entitled to receive at least a majority of the aggregate Closing
Cash Consideration paid to all Stockholders), within thirty (30) days after
such resignation or other inability, appoint a successor to such Person
serving as the Stockholders Committee (who shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer) and immediately thereafter notify Buyer of the identity of such
successor. Any such successor shall succeed the Person serving on the
Stockholders Committee as a Person serving on the "Stockholders Committee"
hereunder. In the event that there is only one Person serving as the
Stockholders Committee at any time, then any action taken by the
Stockholders Committee shall require the consent of (i) such Person or (ii)
those Persons entitled to receive at least a majority of the aggregate
Closing Cash Consideration paid to all Stockholders. If for any reason there
is no Stockholders Committee at any time, all references herein to the
Stockholders Committee shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholders.

(e) _Exculpation_. The Stockholders Committee shall not be liable to any
Stockholder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders Committee
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Stockholders Committee and hold them harmless against any loss,
Liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Stockholders Committee and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of their duties hereunder.

 



12 (f) _Expense Fund_. Upon the Closing, Buyer will wire, to an
account designated by the Stockholders Committee, the Expense Amount, which
will be used to establish an expense fund (the " _Expense Fund_ ") for the
purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders Committee for,
any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Stockholders Committee arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of their duties
hereunder or other third-party expenses or any portion of the Adjustment
Amount. The Stockholders and the Warrantholder hereby acknowledge and agree
that, if and to the extent any Taxes are payable on payments from the Expense
Fund, such Taxes shall be paid from the Expense Fund. The Stockholders and
the Warrantholder will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholders Committee any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Stockholders Committee is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and will not be responsible or liable
for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of
their gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders Committee is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no Tax reporting or income distribution
obligations hereunder. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable
following the termination or expiration of the Stockholders Committees
obligations in connection with this Agreement, the Stockholders Committee
will deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to the Stockholders and the
Warrantholder in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. For Tax
purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders and the Warrantholder at the time
of the Closing.

(g) _Joint Action_. Ron Antevy and Jonathan Antevy (or their successors) shall
act jointly as the Stockholders Committee for all purposes hereunder, and
any action taken by the Stockholders Committee shall require the unanimous
approval of such Persons. In the event that such Persons are in disagreement
as to any matter subject to the authority of the Stockholders Committee
under this Agreement (including under this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_), they shall
each be obligated to negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement, and
if they are unable to promptly resolve such disagreement, they shall engage a
mediator to facilitate such good faith negotiation and the resolution of any
such disagreement.

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for those

outstanding premiums that are due and payable with respect to such insurance
policies have been paid in full. The Company has not received any notice that
any such insurance policy has been or will be cancelled or terminated or will
not be renewed on substantially the same terms as are now in effect or that
the premium on such policy will be materially increased on the renewal

Section 3.13 _Taxes_. 

(a) The Company has timely filed (taking into account applicable extensions of
time to file) all United States federal, state and local and all foreign
income and other material Tax Returns that were required to be filed by it on
or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns were prepared in compliance
with all applicable Laws and correctly reflect in all material respects the
facts regarding the income, business, assets, operations, activities, status
and other matters of, or information regarding, the Company required to be
shown thereon. No extension of time to file any such Tax Return which has not
been filed as of the date of this Agreement has been requested from or granted
by any Governmental Authority (other than automatic extensions available by
statute).

 

(b) The Company has timely paid all Taxes imposed upon it or for which it is
or could be liable, whether to Governmental Authorities or other Persons (as,
for example, under Tax allocation Contracts), with respect to all taxable
periods or portions of periods ending on or before the Closing Date, other
than Taxes that are not yet due and payable and Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by it. The unpaid Taxes of the Company that are not
yet due and payable and that are being contested in good faith do not
materially exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth or included on the Interim Balance Sheet, as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date, in accordance with the past
practices of the Company. The amount of unpaid Taxes that are being contested
in good faith by the Company (as applicable), the Governmental Authority with
whom these Taxes are being contested and the status of these Proceedings do
not materially exceed the amounts set forth on  _Schedule 3.13(b)_.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ , the Company has not been the
subject of any audit, investigation, assessment, examination, suit or any
similar Proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to any taxable
periods in the past five (5) fiscal years or portions of periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. No waiver of any statute of limitation with respect
to the Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company has been given by or requested from
the Company. No written claim has ever been made by any Governmental Authority
in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that the
Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There is no
claim for Taxes being asserted against the Company that has resulted in a Lien
against any asset or property of the Company other than Permitted Liens.

(d) The Company has (i) complied (and through Closing will comply) in all
material respects with all applicable Law relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law and the withholding of a non-
resident shareholders Taxes under any state or local Tax Law), (ii) within
the time and in the manner prescribed by applicable Tax Law, timely withheld
from employee wages, consulting compensation or amounts allocable to non-
resident shareholders and timely paid over to the

 



17  proper Governmental Authority (or is properly holding for such timely

applicable Law, including all Taxes, and (iii) timely filed all withholding
Tax Returns required to be filed, for all periods through and including the
Closing.

 

(e) There are no payments or benefits that could be received (whether in cash

Benefit Plan, Contract or otherwise that would not be deductible by Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates by reason of Section 280G of

meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, or that could be subject to
Section 4999 of the Code.

(f) Each Benefit Plan, Contract and other arrangement that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the

(g) Each Benefit Plan, Contract, and other arrangement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section

Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a party satisfies in form and operation the
requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), 409A(a)(3) and 409A(a)(4) of the Code
and all applicable guidance thereunder (and has satisfied such requirements
for the entire period during which Section 409A of the Code has applied to
such Benefit Plan), and no additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code has been or could be incurred by any participant in any such Benefit
Plan, Contract or other arrangement. No stock or equity option (including the
Company Options) has an exercise price that has been or may be less than the
fair market value of the underlying equity securities as of the date such
option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise
or disposition of such option. No Company Option (or other right to acquire
any Company Stock) is or has ever been a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and Section
1.409A-1(b)(1) of the Treasury Regulations.

(h) Each share of Company Stock is property that is "substantially vested"
under Section 83 of the Code and Section 1.83-3(b) of the Treasury

to the Company under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to any unvested
securities or other property issued by the Company to any of its employees,
non-employee directors, consultants and other service providers, and to the
Companys Knowledge each such election was timely filed.

 

(i) None of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof is a party to, or

reimburse, indemnify, gross-up or otherwise compensate any individual for any
Tax or interest that might be imposed due to application of Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code. 

(j) The Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity Contract, Tax
sharing Contract, Tax allocation Contract or any similar Contract for the
sharing of Tax Liabilities or benefits (excluding a commercial agreement
entered into in the normal course of business, the primary purpose of which is
not related to Taxes), and the Company has no any Liability or potential
Liability to another party under any such agreement.

 



18 (k) The Company has never been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate group under any provision of any applicable
Law. The Company has no Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the

provision of applicable Law) as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
otherwise.

(l) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ , the Company will not be required
to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,

2013.

 

(p) The Company has not participated in any reportable transaction as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4.

income Tax Liability of Company within the meaning of Section 6662(d) of the

6662(d)(2)(B) of the Code if there is or was no substantial authority for
the treatment giving rise to such understatement.

and treated by Company as independent contractors, consultants or in a

Company, or the business, or any of its respective locations or facilities.

violation of any Intellectual Property Right of any third party or which
contests the validity, ownership or right of the Company to exercise any
Intellectual Property Right.

facts or circumstances that might reasonably serve as the basis for any such
Proceeding. No Person is infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise
violating or conflicting with any Company Intellectual Property, or has done

the Transactions, with or without notice or lapse of time, will result in or
give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare: (A) a loss or
impairment of, or Lien on, or the release, disclosure, or delivery to any
other Person of, or the grant, assignment or transfer to any other Person of
any title to or any license or other right or interest under, to or in any

incremental or other discounts, or be bound by

 



29  any incremental or other "most favored pricing" terms to any third party. As
used in this _Section_ __ _ 3.21(g)_, an "incremental" royalty, amount,
discount or "most favored pricing" term refers to a royalty, amount, discount
or "most favored pricing" term, as applicable, in excess, whether by
contractual term, contractual rate or scope, of those obligations that would
have been required to be offered, granted or provided, as applicable, had the
execution of the Transaction Documents or the consummation of the Transactions

who is or has been involved in the development (alone or with others) of any
Intellectual Property by or for the Company has executed and delivered to the
Company a written Contract sufficient to: (i) assign to the Company all right,
title and interest in and to any such Intellectual Property, (ii) waive any
right to receive any further compensation with respect to such assignment, and

other right, title or interest in any Company Intellectual Property. In each
case in which the Company has acquired ownership (or claimed or purported to
acquire ownership) of any Intellectual Property from any Person (including any
employee, officer, consultant or contractor of the Company), the Company has
obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably
transfer ownership of all rights (including the right to sue for and collect
past damages) with respect to such Intellectual Property to the Company.
Neither the Company, nor any of its officers, employees or agents has done,
or failed to do, any act or thing which may, after the Closing, prejudice the

and preserve its rights in the Company Intellectual Property and the
confidentiality of all Trade Secrets owned, exploited, held for exploitation,
appropriated or otherwise obtained or possessed by the Company. All disclosure
of Trade Secrets held by the Company to a Person has been pursuant to either
the terms of a written agreement between the Company and such Person pursuant
to which such Person undertakes to reasonably protect and not disclose such
Trade Secrets or to a Person who is required by applicable Law to not
disclose such information. All exploitation, disclosure or appropriation by
the Company of Trade Secrets not owned by the Company has been pursuant to the
terms of a written agreement between the Company and the owner of such Trade
Secrets, or is otherwise lawful.

disclosed, delivered or licensed to any Person, or agreed to disclose, deliver
or license to any Person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any
escrow agent or other Person of, any Source Code held by the Company. No event
has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without

result in the disclosure, delivery or license by the Company or any Person
then acting on its behalf to any Person of any Source Code held by the
Company.

ARTICLE VII

_JOINT COVENANTS_

Section 7.1 _Representations and Warranties Insurance_. At Buyers request,
the Company and the Stockholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate the purchase of the RandW Insurance Policy by Buyer, including
providing true and complete responses in order to promptly fulfill all
informational requests as reasonably requested by Buyer, the insurer, its
broker or any other insurance agent to obtain and bind the RandW Insurance
Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to
pay any premium, underwriting fee or any other fee or expense relating to or
arising from the purchase of the RandW Insurance Policy by Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer elects not to or is unable to purchase
the RandW Insurance Policy, such failure to obtain the RandW Insurance Policy
will have no effect on the limitations to the Securityholders liability and
obligations, or the limitations on the Buyers right to recourse, set forth in
_Article IX_.

 

Section 7.2 _D andO Tail Policy_ _; Indemnification of Company Officers and
Directors_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase a fully
prepaid "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy, which (a) has an effective term of at least six
(6) years from the Closing Date, (b) covers only those Persons who are
currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the Closing Date and, in each case, only for
matters occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and (c) contains coverage
terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
the Company under the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy (the " _Company D andO Tail Policy_"). The cost of the Company
DandO Tail Policy will be treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder. If the
Transaction is consummated, neither the Company nor Buyer will cancel or
terminate the Company DandO Tail Policy during its term. If the Transaction is
consummated, then until the sixth (6 _th_ ) anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Company and the Buyer will fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to its directors and officers as of immediately
prior to the Closing pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the
Companys Governing Documents as in effect on the date hereof (and the Company
and the Buyer will not amend the Companys Governing Documents in a manner
that limits the Companys or its successors authority to provide the
indemnification under the Company Indemnification Provisions included therein)
(the " _Company Indemnification Provisions_ "), with respect to claims
arising out of matters occurring at or prior to the Closing. Any claims for
indemnification made under this Section 7.2 on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date shall survive such anniversary until the final
resolution thereof.

 



44 Section 7.3 _Further Assurances_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, the parties shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts at their own expense to take, or cause to be taken, all

advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective as promptly
as possible the Transactions, and to cooperate with each other in connection
with the foregoing, subject to the limitations as set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.5_.

 

Section 7.4 _Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Cooperation_. Except for federal and
state income Tax Returns of the Company prepared and filed on a pass-through
basis (" _Pass-Through Tax Returns_ "), Buyer shall prepare and file or cause
to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods
ending on or before the day preceding the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_") and taxable periods beginning on or before and ending on or after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") that are due after the Closing Date
(such Tax Returns, the " _Buyer-Prepared Tax Returns_ "). The Stockholders
Committee shall prepare and file all Pass-Through Tax Returns of the Company
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. All Pass-Through Tax Returns and material Buyer-
Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Laws and
consistent with the Companys past practices, to the extent such practices are
in accordance with applicable Laws. Buyer shall deliver to the Stockholders
Committee draft copies of each such material Buyer-Prepared Tax Return no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the date for filing such Buyer-Prepared
Tax Return, including applicable extensions. Buyer shall permit the
Stockholders Committee to review and comment on each such material Buyer-
Prepared Tax Return prior to filing, and shall give good faith consideration
to all of the Stockholders Committees reasonable comments on each such
material Buyer-Prepared Tax Return made within fifteen (15) days of the
Stockholders Committees receipt of the draft copies of such material Tax
Returns. The Stockholders Committee shall provide draft copies of each Pass-
Through Tax Return to Buyer no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date
for filing such Pass-Through Tax Return, including applicable extensions. The
Stockholders Committee shall incorporate into such Pass-Through Tax Return
all reasonable comments by Buyer, after which such Pass-Through Tax Returns
shall be filed by or on behalf of the Company. The parties shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of such Tax Returns by or on behalf of the Company
and any audit, examination, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to any
such Tax Return. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or any related audit, litigation or
other Proceeding. All Tax deductions arising in connection with the
Transactions on the Closing Date, including any such deductions relating to
payments to holders of Company Options or Company Warrants (or, in each case,
the exercise thereof), Transaction Expenses and the Death and Disability
Benefit Agreements (including the transfer of any insurance policy related
thereto), shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, be
claimed by the Company on its Tax Returns that include the Closing Date
(including for this purpose the consolidated or combined Tax Returns of Buyer
which shall include the Company as of the beginning of the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) and any
comparable provisions of state or local Law), and neither the Company nor any
Stockholder will take, or cause or permit to be taken, any action that would
cause any such deductions to be claimed by the Company prior to the Closing
Date.

 

Section 7.5 _HSR Filings_.

 

(a) Each party hereto represents that it has made an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions and agrees to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act by the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ necessary, proper or 

 



45  advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Buyer shall not make or
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions at
the behest of any Governmental Authority, or take any other action with that
would reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the expiration or termination
of any waiting period under the HSR Act, without the consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, including this  _Section_ __ _
7.5_, in no event shall any party be obligated to agree to any restriction or
modification, or take any action or enter into any settlement or other
agreement or binding arrangement to sell, hold, separate or otherwise dispose
of any partys assets, suggested or requested by any Governmental Authority in
order to facilitate the receipt of any required consents from such
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Transactions. Buyer shall
be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act and under any such other
Laws or regulations applicable to Buyer or the Company.

 

(b) The parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the
other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with the
review under the HSR Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties agree, except as prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, to
(i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any
Governmental Authority relating to the HSR Act and an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (ii) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental Authority
relating to the HSR Act, (iii) if any Governmental Authority initiates a
substantive oral communication relating to the HSR Act, promptly notify the
other party of the substance of such communication, and (iv) provide each
other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all
written communications with, and provide each other with copies of all written
communications from, any Governmental Authority relating to the HSR Act. Any
disclosures or provision of copies by one party to the other may be made
on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.

Section 7.6 _Employee Service Credit_. Employees of the Company shall receive
credit for their service on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and, solely
with respect to vacation and sick leave, level of benefits (but not benefit
accrual) under any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, established or maintained by the Company under which each employee of
the Company may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company
comparable Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing and as would not
result in duplication of benefits.

 

To the extent any employee of the Company participates in a New Plan that is a
welfare plan or arrangement of Buyer during the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the Closing Date (a " _Buyer Welfare Plan_ "), Buyer
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any insurer (including any
stop-loss insurer) or service provider under the applicable Buyer Welfare
Plan, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all (a) pre-existing
condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such employee of
the Company and his or her covered dependents under any such Buyer Welfare
Plan that is a group health plan to be waived to the extent satisfied under a
Benefit Plan comparable to such Buyer Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such employees commencement
of participation in such Buyer Welfare Plan, (b) participation waiting periods
under each Buyer Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such
employee of the Company to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied
under the Benefit Plan comparable to such Buyer

 



46  Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing or, if later, immediately
prior to such employees commencement of participation in such Buyer Welfare
Plan and (c) co-payments and deductibles paid by employees of the Company
under a Benefit Plan that is a group health plan in the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs to be credited for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out of pocket requirement under any comparable Buyer
Welfare Plan that is a group health plan.

 

Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement,
is intended to, or will be construed to, (a) confer upon any employee of the
Company or any other Person other than the parties, in their respective
capacities as Stockholders, to this Agreement any rights or remedies
hereunder; (b) limit the right or ability of the Company, Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates to terminate the employment of (or modify the terms and
conditions of employment of) any employee of the Company, Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates following the Closing, (c) establish or amend any Benefit
Plan or any benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates; or (d) limit the rights of the Company, Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates to establish, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, whether before or after
the Closing.

Section 7.7 _Treatment of Promised Company Options_. None of the Promised
Company Options shall be granted by the Companys board of directors (or a
committee thereof) prior to the Closing. Buyer will cause the Company to pay
to each individual listed on _Schedule 7.7_ , through payroll, the amount set
forth opposite such individuals name on _Schedule 7.7_ , less applicable
withholdings and payroll Taxes, provided the individual executes and does not
revoke thereafter a Transaction Bonus Agreement in the form specified on
_Schedule 7.7_. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that, other than
employment Taxes for which Liability is imposed on the employer, the aggregate
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be added to and
included as a Change in Control Liability, and shall not be borne by Buyer.

 _NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Except as set forth below, the representations and warranties of the Company
and the Stockholders contained in this Agreement, the Schedules (including
any exhibit or annex to the Schedules) and the other Transaction Documents
shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time,
and only such covenants and agreements of the Company, the Stockholders and
Buyer in this Agreement and the other agreements, certificates and documents
contemplated by this Agreement that by their terms survive the Effective Time,
shall survive the Effective Time.

 

Except as set forth below, if the Transactions are consummated, Buyer shall
have no right to indemnification from or recourse against the Stockholders
for any loss, Liability, claim, action, cause of action, cost, damage,
deficiency, Tax, penalty, fine or expense (collectively, " _Damages_ ")
relating to or arising from (a) the breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement, certificate or document contemplated by this Agreement or (b) the
failure of any Stockholder or the Company to perform any of their respective
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other agreement,
certificate or document contemplated by this Agreement that by their terms do
not survive the Effective Time. Any Damages relating to the breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company or the
Stockholders set forth in this Agreement shall be satisfied solely from
amounts of any insurance payments actually paid to and received by Buyer
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy in connection with the breach or events
giving rise to such right to claim for Damages, which such mechanism shall
constitute the sole remedy relating to such Damages. Buyer shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Damages upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Article IX_ shall in any way inhibit Buyer from

by, arising out of or resulting from any Taxes owed by the Company with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the pre-
Closing portion of any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall, (A) in

Section 11.12 _Attorney-_ _Client Privilege_ _; Continued Representation_.
Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, officers,
managers, employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Fenwick and
West LLP may serve as counsel to the Securityholders, the Stockholders
Committee and their respective Affiliates in connection with any matters
related to this Agreement and the contemplated Transactions, including any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the contemplated Transactions notwithstanding any representation
by Fenwick and West LLP prior to the Closing Date of the Company. Buyer and the
Company hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that Fenwick and West
LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in such representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Buyer and any of the Securityholders, the
Stockholders Committee or any of their respective Affiliates, Fenwick and West
LLP may represent the Securityholders, the Stockholders Committee or any of
their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company and even though
Fenwick and West LLP may have represented the Company in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Buyer and the Company also further agree that, as to
all communications prior to Closing among Fenwick and West LLP and the Company,
the Securityholders or their Affiliates and representatives, the
Stockholders Committee or its Affiliates and representatives, that primarily
relate to the negotiation of Transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the
Securityholders and may be controlled by the Securityholders and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company and a third
party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Fenwick and West LLP to such third party; provided, however,
that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Committee (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



54 Section 11.13 _Amendments_. This Agreement shall not be modified or amended
except pursuant to an instrument in writing executed and delivered on behalf
of Buyer and the Stockholders Committee (it being acknowledged and agreed
that, the Company and the Stockholders Committee may amend this Agreement and
waive matters on behalf of the Stockholders, all as contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 2.10_).

Section 11.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason any
party shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive
relief and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the necessity
or proving inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 

Section 11.15 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.
