immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)&nbsp;for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all

Company Employee in the event Parent&#146;s severance policy generally applicable to its similarly
situated employees who commenced employment during the five-year period preceding the Effective

Program applicable to such Company Employee, such Company Employee shall be eligible to receive

result of a Constructive Discharge, such Company Employee shall receive severance benefits under
the Company Severance Program or Parent&#146;s severance policy, as applicable, to the same extent as if
such Company Employee had been involuntarily terminated without cause. For purposes of this
