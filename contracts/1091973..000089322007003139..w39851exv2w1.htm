WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the Company upon the terms set forth herein, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, certain shareholders of the Company have executed a Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Voting Agreement_ "); and 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.02 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, 10019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI as of any date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the Closing prior to April 15, 2008. 

   

 Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL and the Parties shall take all such further action as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all liabilities and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to and consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 5.07_ hereof, at the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in the merger to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub read immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof and applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc., and (b) the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable Law, except that the references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. 

   

 Section 1.06 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable Law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 1.07 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 1.08 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") (including any Restricted Shares as described in _Section 1.10_), other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $27.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 1.08_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.09_. 

   

 (b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange for such cancellation. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to demand and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the 

    ##### 

  

    

DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead holders of such Dissenting
Shares will be entitled to such rights (and only such rights) as are granted
by the provisions of Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws, waives or loses its rights to
appraisal under the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the provisions of
Section 262\. If any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided
in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights
of appraisal, Parent shall have the right to conduct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such notices and demands and the Company shall
have the opportunity to participate in (but not control) such negotiations
and proceedings at its own cost. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, or offer to agree to settle,
any such demands. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 1.09 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a paying agent hereunder (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares (including the Restricted Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares (including the Restricted Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (including the Restricted Shares) (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares   ##### 

  

  

  

represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions
of this Article I (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares (including Restricted Shares) whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.08_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or to cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares), such amounts as may be required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, in respect of which such deduction or withholding were made. 

   

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article I. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former 

    ##### 

  

    

holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares or
Restricted Shares who have not surrendered their Shares or Restricted Shares
in accordance with this _Section 1.09_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of
their Shares or Restricted Shares (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law) but only as a general creditor thereof for
payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_.

is no longer necessary, in each case if such changes proposed by Parent were
to be given effect, (D) the Company has complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this _Section 4.03(c)_ and (E) if the Company
enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in

Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.02(b)_ (and any
purported termination under _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_ shall be void and of no
force and effect, unless in advance or concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Termination Fee and otherwise complies with _Section 7.02_

an increase or other change in purchase consideration, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to clause (ii)(I)

Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as

Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to or
from any third party and/or any Governmental or Regulatory Authority with
respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit the other
Party to review in advance any proposed communication to any supervisory or
Governmental or Regulatory Authority. Each of the Company and Parent agrees

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in this  _Section 5.06_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.06_ shall limit a Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.01(b)(iii)_ so long as such Party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.06_. 

  

 Section 5.07 _Indemnification, Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other similar constituent documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar constituent documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ ") pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this  _Section 5.07_ without limit as to time. 

    ##### 

  

    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any such Persons service as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or services performed in connection with such Persons serving as an officer or director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company, in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties and reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate. It shall be a condition to the advancement of any amounts to be paid in respect of legal and other fees and expenses that the Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. 

  

 (c) The Company shall obtain prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance of the type and with an amount of coverage as are no less favorable than those of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries (the " _Current Policies_ "), and with such other terms as are no less favorable in the aggregate than those of the Current Policies; provided that, in satisfying such obligation, the Company shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 350% of the aggregate per annum amount that the Company paid for such coverage under the Current Policies in the last full year prior to the date hereof, it being understood and agreed that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such amount. 

  

 (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.07_. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of 

    ##### 

  

    

incorporation or by-laws or other constituent documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification
arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to
benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.07_. 

  

 Section 5.08 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the Company and Parent shall assist in any challenge by the other to the validity, or the applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated in this Agreement, of any such statute or regulation. 

  

 Section 5.09 _Employee Benefits_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successor to honor all Company Benefit Plans and other employment or compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms thereof. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be provided, to those individuals actively employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (including employees who are on temporary leave for purposes of jury or military duty, on non-medical leave of absence or on medical or disability leave and for whom it has been 180 calendar days or less since their last day of active employment) (the " _Company Employees_ ") the same base salaries as are provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and employee benefits (excluding for this purpose equity based awards and, with respect to the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2008, excluding annual or quarterly incentive bonuses) that are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than those provided by Parent to similarly-situated employees of Parent. In addition, with respect to the period commencing at the Effective Time and continuing through December 31, 2008, Parent shall continue the annual incentive bonus opportunities for the Company Employees at the same level as is in effect for the bonus period in which the Effective Time occurs and shall maintain in effect during this period the Companys flexible spending benefit plan scheduled on Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits (but not benefit accrual under defined benefit pension or similar plans) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the 

    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates through
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plans in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable employee benefit plan or
compensation arrangement or agreements in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions had not been waived under the comparable plans of the Company
or its subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
prior to the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. 

  

 (c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue and cause to be honored the Companys severance programs and policies described in Section 5.09(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Severance Program_ ") without any amendments adverse to Company Employees; provided, that with respect to a Company Employee in the event Parents severance policy generally applicable to its similarly situated employees who commenced employment during the five-year period preceding the Effective Time would provide more favorable benefits to such Company Employee than the Company Severance Program applicable to such Company Employee, such Company Employee shall be eligible to receive benefits under Parents severance policy, instead of receiving payments or benefits under the Company Severance Program. In addition to any qualifying events, eligibility criteria or other circumstances entitling a Company Employee to severance benefits under the Company Severance Program or Parents severance policy as in effect on the date hereof, in the event that during such one-year period following the Effective Time, such Company Employee terminates employment as a result of a Constructive Discharge, such Company Employee shall receive severance benefits under the Company Severance Program or Parents severance policy, as applicable, to the same extent as if such Company Employee had been involuntarily terminated without cause. For purposes of this Section 5.09(c), the term " _Constructive Discharge_ " shall mean (i) a material diminution in the essential functions of the Company Employees job as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) a relocation of the Company Employees primary workplace to a location more than 50 miles from such Company Employees primary workplace as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) No later than five Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide an opportunity for Parent to make reasonable revisions thereto and Parent will provide any such comments within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such communication. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.09 shall be construed or interpreted to (i) amend any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any Plan, (iii) interfere with the Parents right or obligation to make such changes to any Company Benefit Plan as are necessary to conform with applicable Law, or (iv) alter the at-will employment status of any Company Employee or limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time or, subject to compliance with its obligations under _Section 5.09(c)_, require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any Party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 Section 5.11 _700 MHz Auction_. The Company acknowledges that Parent is currently considering its participation, and may decide to participate, in FCC Auction No. 73 (700 MHz band) (" _Auction 73_ "). If both Parent and the Company elect to participate in Auction 73, or if the Company elects to participate and Parent elects not to participate in Auction 73, each of Parent and the Company will endeavor and cooperate in good faith (including by preparing a joint bidding agreement, if both Parent and Company elect to participate) to enable the Closing to occur without delay and prior to the end of Auction 73. If Parent reasonably believes, based on advice of counsel, that the proposed cooperation (including the joint bidding arrangement, if applicable) will not render any risk of delay of the Closing (because of change in control restrictions under the FCCs rules, violation of applicable Law or otherwise) reasonably unlikely, then the Company will not file a short form 175 for Auction 73. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Treatment of Senior Notes_. (a) Provided that the provisions of  _Sections 5.12(e)_ and _5.12(f)_ are satisfied, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to commence, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, an offer to purchase all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes , and to solicit the consent (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ", together with the offer to purchase, the " _Debt Offer_ ") of the holders of the Senior Notes to certain amendments to the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the " _Indenture Amendments_ "), in each case, on terms and conditions in this _Section 5.12_ and otherwise specified by Parent; provided, that the Indenture Amendments shall be set forth in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and/or other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") necessary to consummate the Debt Offer and the Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offer 

    ##### 

  

    

until Parent shall have provided the Company with the Offer Documents;
provided, further, that prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) make any cash expenditures
or (ii) take any action that could obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase any Senior Notes or incur any additional
obligations to the holders of the Senior Notes prior to the consummation of
the Debt Offer. Any mailings to holders of the Senior Notes shall be subject
to the reasonable approval of the Company and Parent. The terms
and conditions specified by Parent for the Debt Offer shall be only such
terms and such conditions as are customarily included in offers to purchase
debt securities similar to the Senior Notes and otherwise in compliance with
applicable Laws. The closing of the Debt Offer shall be expressly conditioned
on the completion of the Merger and shall be conducted in compliance with
applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. None of the Senior
Notes shall be required to be purchased prior to the Effective Time. The
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by the other in connection with the Debt Offer. 

  

 (b) Subject to _Sections 5.12(e)_ and _5.12(f)_ , if requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for the Senior Notes, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, to the extent permitted by the indenture governing the Senior Notes to (i) at any time after April 15, 2008, issue a notice of optional redemption (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") for all of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, or (ii) take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction, discharge or defeasance of the Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable provisions of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and shall redeem or satisfy, discharge or defease, as applicable, the Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes on the Effective Time (clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Debt Redemption_ "); provided, that (A) in no event shall the Company be required to consummate the Debt Redemption, provide any irrevocable notice of the Debt Redemption or take any other irrevocable act regarding the Debt Redemption prior to the Effective Time, (B) to the extent that any action described in clause (i) or (ii) can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, (C) prior to the Company being required to take any of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, as of the Closing, Parent shall set aside, or shall cause to be set aside sufficient funds to deliver to the Company to effect such redemption or satisfaction or discharge, (D) prior to the Company being required to take any of the actions described in clause (ii) above, Parent shall deliver to, or shall cause to be delivered to, the Company or a paying agent identified by the Company to Parent and reasonably acceptable to Parent sufficient funds to deliver to the Company to effect such redemption or satisfaction or discharge, and (E) any "Opinion of Counsel" required to be given under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Redemption shall be given by counsel to the Surviving Corporation. The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by the other in connection with the Debt Redemption.

 (c) Subject to _Section 5.12(a)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no Law, injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes to the Debt Offer other than as agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer requested by Parent that decreases the price per Senior Note payable in the Debt Offer or related consent solicitation or imposes conditions to the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation that are adverse to the holders of the Senior Notes, unless such change is previously approved by the Company in writing. 

  

 (d) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the Consent Solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consent of holders of the Senior Notes to authorize the Indenture Amendments (the " _Requisite Consent_ ") are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the indenture governing the Senior Notes, which supplemental indentures shall implement the Indenture Amendments and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer).

Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents and Redemption Notice. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Offer and Redemption Notice shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer, any information should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the Senior Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.12(e)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other applicable 

    ##### 

  

    

Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer
and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof. 

  

 (f) In connection with the Debt Offer and any Debt Redemption, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offer and any Debt Redemption upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the Debt Offer and any Debt Redemption promptly following the incurrence thereof. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors and each Person that controls the Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, a " _Company Person_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (excluding the out-of-pocket costs and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence) suffered or incurred by any Company Person, or to which any Company Person may become subject, that arises out of, or in any way in connection with, the Debt Offer, Debt Redemption, or any actions taken, or not taken by Company, or at the direction of Company, pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ or at the request of Parent.

On the Closing Date, subject to Parent making available the necessary funds to do so, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to, (i) repay all outstanding amounts under and terminate the Term Loan Agreement, or any other credit facility or instrument of Indebtedness that by its terms is prepayable or repayable at such time, specified by Parent to the Company no later than three days prior to Closing, and all related Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and (ii) to the extent the related facility is terminated pursuant to this _Section 5.13_, cause to be released, to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to do so at such time, any Liens on its assets relating to those facilities or instruments of Indebtedness. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with this _Section 5.13_ shall not be a condition to any Partys obligation to effect the Merger. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not settle or agree to settle any such litigation without Parents consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Exchange Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall either (i) cause Section 9.1 of the Exchange Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2007, as

The Company shall commence the identification of appropriate locations for the remaining cell sites that are contemplated to be built pursuant to the Companys network improvement plan and for which locations have not been identified. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure appropriate cell sites and obtain all necessary zoning and building permits for the build-out of the cell sites contemplated by the network improvement plan and to develop and approve the budget related to such build-out.

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.01(b)(i)_

 (ii) pursuant to _Section 4.03(c)(ii)_, subject to compliance with the provisions of _Section 4.03(c)_. 

   

 (d) By Parent, 

   #####

 (ii) if (A) a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred, (B) the Company shall have failed to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to stockholders of the Company, (C) the Company or its Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal or approve or recommend, or enter into or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by _Section 4.03(d)_), (D) the Company or its Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall authorize or publicly propose any of the foregoing, or (E) the Company shall have breached in any material respect any of its obligations under _Section 4.03_ or _5.01_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.01_ hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates hereunder, except (i) as set forth in this _Section 7.02_, the confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section 5.04(a)_, the reimbursement and indemnity obligations set forth in _Section 5.12_ and Article IX hereof, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from liability for any willful breach hereof or fraud prior to such termination. 

   

 (b) If this Agreement (i) is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ (other than in respect of clause (A) or clause (B) of _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_), then prior to or concurrently with such termination (or, in the case of a termination by Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within five Business Days), the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $48 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "), which payment shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent or (ii)(A) is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ (but only if, as of the End Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_ and  _Section 6.01(c)_ and _Section 6.02(a)_ and _Section 6.02(b)_ were satisfied) or _7.01(b)(iv)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(i)_ as a result of a willful breach by the Company of a representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein; (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iv)_) or the date of termination (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.01(d)(i)_), a bona fide, written Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known and shall not have been publicly withdrawn at least seven Business Days prior to the Company Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iv)_) or the date of termination (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.01(d)(i)_); and (C) within 12 months after such termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iv)_, 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.01(d)(i)_, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Alternative Proposal (whether or not the same as that
previously announced or made known), then the Company shall promptly pay
Parent the Termination Fee (minus any amount of expenses previously paid
in accordance with _Section 7.02(c)_), but in no event later than two
Business Days after the date of such execution or consummation, which payment
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent. For purposes of this _Section 7.02_, the term "Alternative Proposal"
shall read as if each reference to "20%" in the definition of such term
were a reference to "50%." 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iv)_ (or by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_,  _7.01(b)(ii)_ or _7.01(b)(iii)_ at any time when this Agreement is terminable pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iv)_), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the sum of Parents and Merger Subs reasonably documented expenses (not to exceed $10 million) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Parent, within two Business Days after the date of such termination; provided that the payment by the Company of such expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.02(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to any other provision of this _Section 7.02_. 

   

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that without these agreements Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay Parent the Termination Fee when due, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this _Section 7.02_ and shall pay interest on the amount of the Termination Fee, at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded daily, from the date such Termination Fee became due and owing through and including the date of payment. In addition, the Parties further agree that, if the Company fails to pay Parent any amount payable under this Agreement when due or Parent fails to pay the Company any amount payable under this Agreement when due (other than the amounts referred to in the prior sentence), the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay interest on such amount at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded daily, from the date such amount became due and owing through and including the date of payment. 

   

 Section 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Company and Parent pursuant to a writing adopted by action taken by each of them at any time before the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company no amendment may be made which under applicable law would require approval of such Partys stockholders without such approval. 

   

 Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the Company and Parent may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the others, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements 

    ##### 

  

    

or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only as against such Party and only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party.

 Section 9.04 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, then all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. 

   

 Section 9.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitute the entire agreement and, except as expressly set forth herein, supersedes any and all other prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except for _Section 1.08_ and _Section 1.09_ (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of the Shares (including Restricted Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) and _Section 5.07_ (which shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and, after the Effective Time their respective stockholders, any rights or remedies hereunder. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 9.07 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 Section 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. 

   

 Section 9.09 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.09_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

   

 Section 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER. 

   

 Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss, and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby waived. It is further agreed that, in the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the Party or Parties who are or are to be thereby aggrieved shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in
equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
waived. Any such action may be enforced in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). 

   

 Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

     ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
