Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof or any party
hereto, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) shares held in the Companys treasury or by
any of the Subsidiaries or by Parent and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in
_Section 3.3_)) shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the Per Share Merger Consideration, payable in cash
to the holder thereof, without interest thereon, together with any amounts
that may become payable in respect of such shares from the Escrow Fund as
provided in _Section 3.7_ and the Escrow Agreement, any amounts that may
become payable in respect of the post-closing adjustment as provided in
_Section 3.9(b)_, and any amounts received by Parent or its Affiliates on or
after the Closing with respect to the BP Claims, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein (the " _Additional Merger
Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing
such share, all in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(b) _Treasury Shares_. Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company or by any Subsidiary or by Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist as of the Effective
Time and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each share of capital stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any action on the part of Merger Sub, be converted into one
share of the corresponding class of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding award
of restricted stock (including any performance-based restricted stock awards)
in respect of shares of Common Stock granted under the Option Plan or
otherwise (each, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall fully vest (to the
extent unvested), all time-based restrictions shall lapse and all performance-
based vesting conditions will be deemed to have been satisfied in full. Upon
such vesting, each share of Common Stock underlying each Restricted Stock
Award shall be treated as Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement,
with any applicable taxes withheld in accordance with _Section 3.10_.

 



 

(e) _Holders of Certificates_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall
cease to have any rights

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to such Certificates, except the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without interest, with respect to each of the shares
represented thereby.

 



 

 **Section 3.2** **Exchange of Certificates**.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Procedures_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, in trust with an exchange agent
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to pay all sums to be paid pursuant to
_Section 3.1_, and to make the appropriate cash payments, if any, to holders
of Common Stock which cease to be Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 3.3_
hereof (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent (any
interest or other income resulting from such investment shall be paid to
Parent), but only in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or
obligations of an agency of the United States which are backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million
(based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise);
_provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable to Stockholders, and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders in
the amount of any such losses. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise
deliver to each record holder of Certificates a form of letter of transmittal
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") for return to the Paying Agent (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in such form as Parent shall reasonably
specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of any
Certificates, together with such duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the
holder of each such Certificate shall receive promptly from the Paying Agent
in exchange therefor, the applicable consideration set forth in _Section 3.1_
and each such Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. If payment or
delivery is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer, that the signatures on the Certificate or any
related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person
requesting such payment either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. All cash paid
upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this _Section 3.2_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock represented thereby.

 



 

(b) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate (other than any
Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an

 



      
 

 



 

affidavit of that fact by the registered holder of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate in form and substance acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect thereof in
the manner set forth in _Section 3.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may require the delivery of a
satisfactory indemnity.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the Stockholders for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. If Certificates are not surrendered
prior to the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time, unclaimed amounts
(including interest thereon) of the Per Share Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation and may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this _Section 3.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment for their claims
in the form and amounts to which such stockholders are entitled.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the fullest
extent permitted by the law, none of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided for,
and in accordance with, the provisions of this _Section 3.2_ and any post-
closing adjustment as provided in _Section 3.9(b)_.

 



 

 **Section 3.3** **Appraisal Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable as provided in _Section 3.2(a)_,
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. As of the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares
under Section 262 shall cease to exist and such Dissenting Shares shall be
converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the

 



      
 

 



 

Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.2(a)_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of its receipt of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and, subject to applicable law, direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. None of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

agreement), whether vested or unvested, to be cancelled and terminated as of
the Effective Time (each such cancelled and terminated Company Option, a "
_Cancelled Company Option_ ").

 



 

(ii) _Calculation of Closing Payment._ Pursuant to the cancellation and
termination of each Cancelled Company Option, each Optionholder shall be

Consideration _over_ (B) the applicable exercise price per share of Common
Stock issuable under such Cancelled Company Option (the " _Closing Option
Consideration_ "), together with such Optionholders Pro Rata Share of any
Additional Merger Consideration that may become payable in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, in each case less applicable taxes withheld in
accordance with _Section 3.10_.

than the second payroll payment date, after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Termination of Company Option Plan_. Prior to the Closing, the Company

effective at or prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
obtaining any necessary consents from the holder of a Company Option or
Restricted Stock Award. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Common Stock to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Restricted Stock Awards or Company Options
after the Effective Time.

Cash and Indebtedness, (ii) changes in Net Working Capital against the Target
Net Working Capital Amount and (iii) the Rental Fleet Sales and Rental Capital
Expenditures, and such processes (A) are not intended to permit the
introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the
purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheets or determining Cash,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Rental Fleet Sales or Rental Capital
Expenditures, or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at
any time by Parent or any other transaction entered into by Parent in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any of the plans, transactions, funding, payments or changes
which Parent initiates or makes or causes to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or
their business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Parent or any of its assets or liabilities, and (B) do not
reflect, directly or indirectly, any additional or increased reserve or
accrual that is not reflected in the Financial Statements. The Stockholder
Representative and its accountants and other representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records
and any work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement
and the adjustments contemplated hereby. If Parent fails to timely prepare and
deliver the Closing Statement, then, at the election of the Stockholder
Representative, the Closing Merger Consideration shall be final and binding
upon and not appealable or subject to further review by the Parties. The
Stockholder Representative and its accountants and other representatives may
make reasonable inquires of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective accountants regarding questions or disagreements concerning the
Preliminary Statement, and Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any such accountants to reasonably cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. At the request of the Stockholder Representative, the Surviving
Corporation shall permit any person who is employed by the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates after the Closing to advise and assist the
Stockholder Representative in its review of the Preliminary Statement and any
objections or disputes with respect thereto. If the Stockholder Representative
has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its
objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement
is not delivered to Parent within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the
Preliminary Statement to the Stockholder Representative, the Preliminary
Statement shall be final, binding and non appealable by the Parties hereto
provided that the Stockholder Representative has had at least ten (10) days to
review any papers or documents reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative or its

 



      
 

 



 

representatives during the forty-five (45) day review period; provided,
further, that in the event that Parent does not, or does not cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, make available to the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives documents, information or
personnel pursuant to this _Section 3.9(a)_ within five (5) days of a
reasonable request therefor (or such shorter period as may remain in the
review period), the review period shall be extended by one (1) day for each
additional day required for Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to fully respond to such request. If an
Objections Statement is timely delivered, the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections set forth
therein, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall engage a nationally recognized certified public accounting
firm as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (the " _Valuation Firm_ ") and submit such dispute to the
Valuation Firm. Any further submissions to the Valuation Firm must be written
and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Valuation Firm shall make a
final determination only of any objections contained in the Objections
Statement relating to the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, Rental Fleet Sales, Rental Capital Expenditures and Transaction
Expenses (it being understood and agreed that all other items which are not
the subject of objections in the Objections Statement shall be final, binding
and non-appealable by the Parties hereto), and the resulting Final Merger
Consideration calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such
amounts are in dispute, in each case in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement. The Parties will cooperate with the
Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement. If an Objections Statement
is delivered to the Valuation Firm for resolution, the determination of any
objections relating to the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, Rental Fleet Sales, Rental Capital Expenditures and Transaction
Expenses, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration calculated with
reference thereto, shall become final and binding on the Parties on the date
the Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Parties
(absent manifest error or fraud).

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Merger Consideration is
greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly (but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the
Final Merger Consideration) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent for
further payment to the Stockholders and the Optionholders, their Pro Rata
Share of the amount of such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent. If the Final
Merger Consideration is less than the Closing Merger Consideration, the
Stockholder Representative shall promptly (but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration)
pay on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders (on a pro rata basis
according to each Stockholders or Optionholders Pro Rata Share) to Parent
the absolute value of such difference (which shall be paid first, out of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount or, if the Adjustment Escrow Amount is less than the
amount payable to Parent under this _Section 3.9_, second, from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated in writing by Parent. If any funds remain in the
Adjustment Escrow Amount following such payment, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
3.9_, cause the Escrow Agent to deposit such remaining funds with the

 



      
 

 



 

Paying Agent for delivery to the Stockholders and Optionholders according to
their Pro Rata Shares.

 



 

(c) _Fees of the Valuation Firm_. The fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm
shall be paid by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if
the Stockholder Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
Parent, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Selling Stockholders) and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷
500) to Parent. In connection with its determination of Purchase Price, the
Accounting Firm shall also determine the allocation of its fees and expenses
between Parent and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Selling
Stockholders) pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.9(c)_. The Stockholder
Representative shall pay any fees and expenses to be borne by the Stockholders
pursuant to this _Section 3.9(c)_ from the Expense Reserve ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that, to the extent such fees and expenses are in excess of the
amounts remaining in the Expense Reserve, Parent shall have no liability with
respect to such excess amounts).

 



 

 **Section 3.10** **Withholding**. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (and
their respective successors) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the consideration payable Stockholders and Optionholders (or
any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or
change-in-control compensation to be paid to Stockholders or Optionholders as
a result of this Agreement) such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
(and their respective successors), as the case may be, are required to deduct
and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company (and their respective successors) or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the

own or lease its property and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction wherein the nature of its business or
the ownership of its assets makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not,

Adverse Effect. The Company has previously provided or made available to
Parent and Merger Sub true and complete copies of (a) its certificate of
incorporation and all amendments thereto or restatements thereof, (b) its by-
laws as currently in effect and (c) true and complete copies of the

are in full force and effect.

 



 

 **Section 4.2** **Authorization**. The Company has the corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each other Merger Document
to be executed by the Company in connection herewith and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, all of which have been duly authorized
by all requisite corporate action (other than the Stockholder Approval). This
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming that this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as the enforceability hereof may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or applicable
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

 **Section 4.3** **Non-contravention**.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other Merger
Document, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby nor the fulfillment of and the performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder will (a) contravene any provision contained in
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) conflict with, violate or
result in a breach (with or without the lapse of time, the giving of notice or
both) of, or constitute a default (with or without the lapse of time, the
giving of notice or both), or require any consent of any Person, under (i)
except as set forth in _Schedule 4.3_, any Contract or Material Lease, or
(ii) any Order or Law, in each case to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of
their respective assets or properties are subject, (c) except as expressly
contemplated herein or with respect to Liens granted to any lender at the
Closing in connection with any financing by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
of the assets or properties of the Company or the Subsidiaries, or (d) except
as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_, result in the acceleration of, or permit any
Person to terminate, modify, cancel, accelerate or declare due and payable
prior to its stated maturity, any obligation of the Company or any
Subsidiaries, which in the case of any of clauses (b) through (d) above,
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) No "fair price," "interested shareholder," "business combination" or
similar provision of any state takeover law is, or at the Effective Time will
be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

DGCL, (c) filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be
required under, and other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act, and (d) the

Authority is necessary for the execution, delivery or performance of this

Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any material Tax or penalty (civil or otherwise)
imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable law. There is no lawsuit or
audit by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened. All
contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any of its

or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in each case in all material respects.

States.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.13(g)_ , no Employee Benefit Plan nor
any other agreement, contract or arrangement with respect to any current or
former director or employee could result, separately or in combination with
any other event, in (i) the payment, acceleration or enhancement of any
compensation or benefit, (ii) the transfer or set aside of any assets to fund
any material benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) any material
liability under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iv) any restriction on the right

"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, in
each case as a result of the execution or approval of this Agreement or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement". Except as
set forth in _Schedule 4.13_ , neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligation to provide, and no Employee Benefit Plan or other agreement
provides any individual with the right to, a gross up, indemnification,
reimbursement or other payment for any excise or additional taxes, interest or
penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code or due
to the failure of any payment to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(h) _Schedule 4.13(h)_ lists any Multiemployer Plan that is maintained,
sponsored or contributed to or with respect to which any liability would
reasonably be expected to be borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any "withdrawal
liability" with respect to any Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied
in full. All contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to each Multiemployer Plan in respect of current
or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in each case in all material respects.

ERISA with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them or any ERISA Affiliate. No purpose of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is for the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any other entity to avoid liability arising out of
Title IV of ERISA.

relationships with its employees, customers and suppliers. This _Section
6.1(a)_ shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to permit any access
to or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is reasonably likely to violate any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or any Contract to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof or cause any privilege
(including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or its Subsidiaries
would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information,
(ii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, any information that is reasonably pertinent
thereto, (iii) any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or third parties, or (iv)
any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is reasonably likely to violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company or such of its Subsidiaries shall
have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such disclosure; _provided_ , that in the case of _clause (i)_
above, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to find a way to
allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in
the reasonable belief of the Company or such of its Subsidiaries (after
consultation with counsel)) be reasonably likely to result in the violation of
any such applicable Law or Contract or be reasonably likely to cause such
privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably be managed (in the reasonable belief of the Company or such of its
Subsidiaries (after consultation with counsel)) through the use of customary
"clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee representatives of
Parent and Merger Sub could be provided access to such information.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All information disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub (or their
representatives or affiliates), whether before or after the date hereof,

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including _Section 6.4(d)_ below, the Company, Parent and Merger

Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as

documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) in

 



      
 

 



 

the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other Order is
entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that
would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or
delay consummation of any such transaction, using reasonable best efforts to
take any and all steps necessary to resist, prevent, eliminate, vacate,
modify, reverse, remove or suspend such Order so as to permit such
consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall discuss with and permit the other
Party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views and comments of the other in connection with any proposed filing,
written materials or communication to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other as promptly as

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the performance of each
Partys respective obligations pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ and _Section
6.4(d)_ below, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may, as each determines is
reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive material provided to
the other pursuant to this _Section 6.4(b)_ as " _Outside Counsel Only_."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials,
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.4_, materials
provided to the other Party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Authority, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall keep the
others apprised of the status of matters relating to approvals of or
investigations by any Governmental Authority of the transactions contemplated

the other Party of any material or substantive oral communication between that

respective Affiliates, and any Governmental Authority with respect to such
filings, approvals or investigations. Neither the Company nor Parent or Merger
Sub shall permit any of its Affiliates, officers or any other representatives
to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call, or discussion with
any Governmental Authority either in respect of any filings, investigation or
other inquiry with or of Governmental Authorities with respect to Antitrust
Laws in each case in connection with the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement or other Merger Documents, unless it consults
with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

 



 

(d) _Antitrust Commitments_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant
to this _Section 6.4_ each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and Parent and Merger Sub agree to take or cause to be
taken the following actions:

(ii) Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Company shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any inquires received from, and provide to each and
every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any antitrust law (a " _Governmental
Antitrust Authority_ ") any additional non-privileged information and
documents requested by any such Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection
with obtaining any such approval of such Governmental Antitrust Authority that
is necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly as reasonably practicable complying
with or modifying any requests for additional information (including any
"second request" or equivalent) by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(iii) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, directly or
indirectly, enter or agree to enter into any agreement to acquire, whether by
merger, consolidation, business combination, the purchase of assets or equity
or otherwise, any business or Person if such transaction could reasonably be
expected to materially delay or impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section 6.4_, shall require,
or be construed to require, Parent to agree or be required to sell, divest,
license, transfer, dispose of or encumber or hold separate and agree to sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, business or interest therein of
Parent or any of its respective Affiliates or to agree or be required to be
subject to any

 



      
 

 



 

changes or restrictions on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own,
operate or take any other actions with respect to any of such assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
until the Termination Date (as defined below) have the obligation, to defend
any Action brought by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Closing or to seek to cause to be lifted or rescinded

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require the Company or its Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations prior to the Closing unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing.

 



 

(h) Each party shall give prompt written notice to the other of (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure
would cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent and Merger
Sub, as the case may be, contained in the Merger Documents to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
Effective Time or that will result in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions specified in _ARTICLE VII_ and such written notice shall specify
the representation or warranty so breached and (ii) any failure of the Company
or Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
the Merger Documents; _provided_ that no such notice shall be deemed to cure
any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or have
any effect for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VII_.

 



 

 **Section 6.5** **Public Announcements**. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
(i) shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to any aspect of this Agreement or the Merger and (ii)
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation; _provided_ that each party hereto may make any such

") thereafter (i) base salary or wage rate, equity or equity based award
opportunities and incentive award opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rate, equity or equity
based award opportunities and incentive award opportunities, that such
employees received from the Company and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) employee benefit
and fringe benefits (excluding defined benefit plans), that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits and fringe benefits
(excluding defined benefit plans) provided to such employees by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under the applicable Employee Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall
require the employment of any employee for any specified period of time or

Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, from and after the Closing Date,

(ii) for purposes of vacation accrual under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement established or maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _Merger Sub Plans_ "), except
with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that such crediting would result in duplication of benefits. In
addition, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries
to waive all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work
requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any Merger Sub Plans to the extent waived
or satisfied by an employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing
Date, and (ii) any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by
any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing
Date under any applicable Merger Sub Plan for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs.

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that the Merger constitutes a "Change
of Control" as defined under the Option Plan and any and all severance,
"change of control" or other similar agreements to which the Company is a
party that are listed on _Schedule 4.13_. Parent and Merger Sub will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to satisfy and comply with the terms and
conditions of such plans and agreements (other than the Option Plan, which

period necessary to fulfill the Companys or its Subsidiaries obligations
thereunder.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor all employee

conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the
" _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), any payments that reasonably could constitute a
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _Parachute
Payment_ "), (2) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that at least seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the right
to any Parachute Payment shall have been irrevocably waived by each of the
applicable "disqualified

 



       
 

 



 

individuals" (as defined under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) and (3) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
true and complete copies of all disclosure and documents that comprise the
stockholder approval of each Parachute Payment in sufficient time to allow
Parent to comment thereon but no less than five Business Days prior to the
280G Stockholder Vote, and shall reflect all reasonable comments of Parent
thereon.

 



 

(f) If requested in writing by Parent least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate,
effective not later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing,

intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. In the event that Parent
requests that such plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such plan(s) has been terminated (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing.

 



 

(g) Prior to making any written or oral communications to any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or
other employment-related matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy

this _Section 6.6_ with respect to employees of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the Company, Merger Sub and
Parent and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any
Employee Benefit Plan or Merger Sub Plan. No provision of this Agreement shall
be construed as a limitation on the right of Parent or the Company to suspend,
amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement. Further, (x) no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as
an amendment to any employee benefit plan including any Employee Benefit Plan
and Merger Sub Plan and (y) no provision of this Agreement shall be construed
as limiting Parents or the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries discretion
and authority to interpret the respective employee benefit and compensation
plans, agreements arrangements, and programs including any Employee Benefit
Plan or Merger Sub Plan, in accordance with their terms and applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 6.7** **Indemnification of Directors and Officers**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses as incurred to,
in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_") against any costs, expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_
") incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, based on, arising
out of or related to such DandO Indemnified Parties service as a director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
Persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Person (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_"),
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or
any other indemnification or advancement right of any DandO Indemnified Party.
In addition, from and after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will advance to each DandO Indemnified Party all DandO Expenses incurred
in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances
where the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company has assumed the defense of such
claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. For the
purposes of this _Section 6.7(a)_, " _D andO Expenses_" will include reasonable
documented attorneys fees and all other documented costs, charges and
expenses actually paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim to the extent such costs, charges and expenses relate to
payments by or on behalf of a DandO Indemnified Party, but will exclude losses,
judgments and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in the
definition of Costs).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the managers,
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
managers, directors and officers insurance policies for the DandO Indemnified
Parties, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary and employment practices
liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six years from and after the Closing from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance
carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to managers, directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary and employment practices
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits, terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable
to the DandO Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies with respect
to any matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing (including
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub
be required to expend for such "tail" insurance policies pursuant to this
sentence an aggregate premium in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If Parent or Merger Sub for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing,
the Company shall, and Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Company to (at
Parent and Merger Subs expense), continue to maintain in effect for a period
of at least six years from and after the Closing, the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date of this Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage that are at least as

 



      
 

 



 

favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement, or the Company shall, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Company to (at Parent and Merger Subs expense), use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent and Merger Sub be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Company shall, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Company to (at Parent and Merger Subs expense), obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 



 

(c) If Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, who are

applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any DandO Indemnified Party as provided in the governing documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such DandO
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Closing and shall not be terminated, amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such DandO
Indemnified Party without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Party and each
Person entitled to insurance coverage under this _Section 6.7_, respectively,

with the ongoing business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries)

connection therewith) and the repayment of the indebtedness listed on

collateral at the Closing and (vii) assisting Parent in the satisfaction of
conditions precedent set forth in any debt financing to the extent the
satisfaction of such conditions requires the cooperation of or is within the
control of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company hereby consents to the
use of the logos of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
syndication or marketing of any debt financing, provided that such logos are
not used in a manner that would reasonably be expected to harm or disparage
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks.

 



 

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability prior to the

them, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from the
arrangement of any debt financing by Parent, any other cooperation pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_, and/or the provision of information utilized in
connection therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except
to the extent such Losses arise out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining debt financing is not a
condition to the Closing. In the event the Debt Financing has not been
obtained, Parent will continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_, to consummate the

 **Section 6.9** **Senior Notes Redemption**. On or prior to the Closing

retained under current retention policies for a period of at least seven (7)
years from the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Closing

the research and support of the BP Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be required to settle or compromise the BP Claims to the
extent any proposed

 



      
 

 



 

settlement or compromise would restrict the future activity or conduct of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), and the
Stockholder Representative shall consider in good faith the views of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation with respect to any proposed settlement or
compromise.

accordance with each Stockholders or Optionholders, as the case may be,
respective Pro Rata Share. The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant

If any such Tax Return reports any Stockholders Taxes, (i) at least forty
five (45) days prior to filing any such Tax Return, Parent shall submit, or
caused to be submitted, a copy of such proposed Tax Return (and such
additional information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably be
requested by Stockholder Representative) to Stockholder Representative for
Stockholder Representatives review and Parent shall consider, or cause to be
considered, in good faith any reasonable comments of the Stockholder
Representative to such Tax Returns; and (ii) the Stockholders shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent any Stockholders Taxes reported on such Tax
Return at least five (5) Business Days before payment of Taxes (including
estimated Taxes) is due to the applicable Governmental Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as required by Law, Parent shall not, and shall not allow the
Company (or the Surviving Corporation) or any of their Subsidiaries, to amend
any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period or otherwise initiate (or agree to) any other matter
relating to Stockholders Taxes without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative; such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

(d) No election under Section 338(g) of the Code shall be made with respect to
the acquisition of the Company contemplated by this Agreement **.**

 



 

(e) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed
to be: (i) in the case of all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the
taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(f) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) (i) cooperate and assist
each other in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii)
cooperate and assist each other in any audit or other Proceeding with respect

or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries (including copies
of Tax Returns and related work papers) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period; and (iv) provide certificates or forms, and timely execute
any Tax Returns, that are necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption
for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax **.**

 



 

 **Section 9.3** **Tax Proceeding**. If any Governmental Authority issues to
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (A) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct any
other proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Straddle Period or with respect to Taxes that
are or could be Stockholders Taxes, (B) a notice of deficiency for such Tax
periods or Stockholders Taxes, Parent shall notify the Stockholder
Representative of the receipt of such communication from the Governmental
Authority within ten (10) days of receipt and provide copies of all
correspondence and other documents received from the Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay of Parent to give notice to
the Stockholder Representative as provided in this _Section 9.3_ shall not
relieve the Stockholders or Optionholders of their obligations hereunder
except to the extent the Stockholders or Optionholders shall have been
actually prejudiced by such failure. At its election, the Stockholder
Representative shall control any Tax Proceeding relating solely to
Stockholders Taxes in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant
to this Agreement. Parent shall control all other Tax Proceedings with respect
to the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation or the Company. The Parties shall consult with each
other regarding any Tax Proceeding that could relate to Stockholders Taxes,
provide each other with information and documents related thereto, permit the
non-controlling party and its representative and advisors to attend any such
Tax Proceeding, and not settle any such issue without the consent of the non-
controlling party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

 **Section 9.4** **Transfer Taxes**. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne
equally by Parent on one hand and the Stockholders and Optionholders, on the
other hand. Such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the party legally responsible

responsible to pay the tax its share of such tax at least five (5) Business

 **Section 10.4** **Direct Claims**.

deemed to refer to the Stockholder Representative (except for the avoidance of
doubt any provisions relating to an obligation to make payments or incur any
liability), and (ii) if Parent comprises the Indemnitor, any references to the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholder Representative.
Any payment received by Stockholder Representative as the Indemnified Party
shall be distributed to the Stockholders and Optionholders in accordance with
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Other than with respect to a Third Party Claim, any Party hereto seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver to the
Party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which shall be delivered
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days), after the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party acquires actual knowledge of the basis for a claim of
indemnification hereunder and which shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such claim, and shall include in such Claim Notice (if
then known) the amount, or the method of computation of the amount, of such
claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith
upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or
delay of the Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice promptly to the
Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been materially and actually
prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(c) After the timely delivery of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section
10.4(a)_, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be determined (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures**.

 



 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall notify
the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Person Claim
within fifteen (15) Business Days (or reasonably more promptly dependent upon
the circumstances) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of such Third Person Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnitor, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitor relating to such Third Person Claim (a " _Third
Person Claim Notice_ "). Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
refer to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based and
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the facts giving rise to
an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of such Third Person Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to give notice
to the Indemnitor as provided in this _Section 10.5_ shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor
shall have been actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor shall have
thirty (30) Business Days (or such lesser number of days as set forth in the
Third Person Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event
of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Third Person Claim Notice (the "
_Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend
the Indemnified Party against such Third Person Claim.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third
Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the
receipt of notice, at its option and at its

 



      
 

 



 

own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Person Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any
such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or
continue control of the defense of any Third Person Claim if (i) the Third
Person Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
regulatory proceeding, (ii) based on the advice of outside legal counsel to
the Indemnified Party, a conflict (including the availability of different or
additional defenses) exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor
in connection with such Third Person Claim or conduct of claim by the
Indemnitor would compromise any legal privilege or similar doctrine with
respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iii) the Third
Person Claim primarily seeks (x) an injunction against the Indemnified Party
or (y) where the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, equitable
relief requiring the taking of action or the refraining from taking actions by
Parent. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully and in good faith with
the Indemnitor in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any Third Person Claim. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such
Third Person Claim by written notice to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party may retain counsel at the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such
proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in addition to any local counsel who may need to be
retained. The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third Person Claim on a basis that would not include an unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party and would (i) exceed the balance of the Indemnitors
indemnity obligations hereunder if the Indemnified Party is a Stockholder, or
exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if the Indemnified Party is a Parent
Indemnified Party, (ii) result in the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) result in a finding or
admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) impose ongoing
obligations on the Indemnified Party following the date of such settlement or
compromise.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnitor (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a
Third Person Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice
of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming the defense of
a Third Person Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Person Claim within ten (10) days after receiving
written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnitor
has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to assume its own defense; _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Person Claim shall
not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Person Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Person Claim seeking money
damages without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Person Claim,
including by providing access to each others relevant business records and
other documents and employees; _it_ _being_

 



      
 

 



 

 _understood_ that the reasonable documented costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party relating thereto shall constitute Losses.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall use reasonable best efforts
to avoid production or other disclosure of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Person Claim
to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges.

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **Determination of Indemnification Amounts**.

 



 

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_ARTICLE X_, Losses recoverable under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, tax benefits (net of tax detriments), contribution payments or
reimbursements, in each case to the extent actually received (net of costs of
enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any available coverage under any
"occurrence" based Company insurance policies or from other third parties,
including, without limitation, pursuant to indemnification obligations of
third parties in favor of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries. If
Parent and the Surviving Corporation fail to pursue recoveries under any
"occurrence" based Company insurance policies or from third parties,
including, without limitation, pursuant to indemnification obligations of
third parties in favor of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, then
the Stockholder Representative shall have the right of subrogation to pursue
such insurance policies or third parties on behalf of the Stockholders and may
take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of subrogation in
the name of the party from whom subrogation is obtained; _provided_ that the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party has received payment with respect to any
Losses under such Claim (whether from the Indemnity Escrow Account or the
Stockholders). In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third
Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor
has indemnified it pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_
shall constitute an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes
and shall be treated as such by the Parties hereto for Tax purposes to the
greatest extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder
for any Losses arising from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth herein (and the amount of any Losses incurred in
respect of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of any
limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

such Losses are included in the calculation of Net Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(d) In connection with the matters covered by this _ARTICLE X_, no
Stockholder shall have (i) any right to indemnity or contribution from the
Company or (ii) any right of subrogation against the Company with respect to
any indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Parties by reason of any
indemnification provided in _Section 10.2_, it being agreed and acknowledged
that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company
herein are solely for the benefit of Parent and the Parent Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** **Mitigation** **. **Each Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
all Losses after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith. In the event that an Indemnified Party
shall fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any
claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
indemnify any Person for any portion of the Losses that could have been
avoided if such party had made such efforts.

Optionholder might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that the Stockholder Representative may lawfully do or cause to be done by
virtue hereof. Each Stockholder and Optionholder further acknowledges and
agrees that, upon execution of this Agreement, with respect to any delivery by
the Stockholder Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement,
certificate or other documents executed by the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, such Stockholder or Optionholder shall be bound by
such documents as fully as if such Stockholder or Optionholder had executed
and delivered such documents itself. After the Closing, the Stockholder
Representative shall have no authority or power to act on behalf of any party
to this Agreement, other than the Stockholders and Optionholders.

 



 

 **Section 11.2** **Actions by Stockholders and Optionholders**. Each
Stockholder and Optionholder agrees that, notwithstanding _Section 11.1_, at
the request of the Stockholder Representative, such Stockholder or
Optionholder shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the

Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Stockholder or Optionholder. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or
Optionholder for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder or under any other document contemplated hereby, or in connection
therewith, except that the Stockholder Representative shall not be relieved of
any liability imposed by Law for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or
Optionholder for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Stockholder or
Optionholder to which payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from

to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of

in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Merger Document has been unconditionally authorized by the Stockholders
and Optionholders to be taken, omitted to be taken, or executed on their
behalf so that they will be legally bound thereby, and each Stockholder and
Optionholder agrees not to institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other
proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation alleging
that Diamond Castle Holdings, LLC did not have the authority to act as the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders in
connection with any such action, omission or execution. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this _ARTICLE XI_ shall in no way impose any
obligations on Parent or any of its Affiliates. In particular, notwithstanding
any notice received by Parent or its Affiliates to the contrary, Parent and
its Affiliates shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled
to rely upon, and shall have no Liability to any Stockholder or Optionholder
with respect to actions, decisions or determinations of the Stockholder
Representative. Parent and its Affiliates shall be entitled to assume that all
actions, decisions and determinations of the Stockholder Representative are

such time and distribute to each Stockholder and Optionholder its Pro Rata
Share of any

 



      
 

 



 

remaining portion of the Expense Reserve, _it being understood_ and agreed
that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility of the Representative
only and that neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving Company shall have any
obligation to ensure that such distribution is, or distributions are, made. If
the Expense Reserve is insufficient to reimburse the Stockholder
Representative in full, the Stockholder Representative may instruct Parent,
when making any deposits with the Paying Agent for further payment to the
Stockholders pursuant to _ARTICLE III_, to direct to the Stockholder

 **Section 12.2** **Exhibits and Schedules**. All exhibits and schedules
hereto, or documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in full in this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, any matter
that is clearly disclosed in a Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been included in such other Schedules for which applicability of such
matter is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the omission of an
appropriate cross reference thereto. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule or in the data room shall not necessarily mean that such fact or item
is material to the Company or its Subsidiaries individually or taken as a
whole. There may have been included in a Schedule or in the data room and may
be included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not "material", and
such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an agreement by the Company that such
items are "material" or to further define the meaning of such term for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.3** **Time of the Essence; Computation of Time**. Time is of
the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last
day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder
shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or any date on which banks in New York
City, New York are authorized to be closed, the party having such privilege or
duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding
day which is a regular business day.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 12.4** **Expenses**. Regardless of whether the transactions
provided for in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided
herein, each party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. Parent and Merger Sub
understand and acknowledge that all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
or to be incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be paid by the Company in cash at or prior to the
Closing.

 



 

 **Section 12.5** **Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction**

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without reference to the choice of law
or conflicts of law principles thereof that would apply the law of another
jurisdiction, except that the consummation and effectiveness of the Merger and
other matters relating to the requirement of the DGCL as applicable to the
Merger and this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by any other Party or
its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any New York
State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New
York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate
New York State or federal court) or any Illinois State or federal court
sitting in the Northern District of Illinois, Cook County, or the City of
Chicago (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any
appropriate Illinois State or federal court), and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and
with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to
any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts). Each of the
Parties further agrees to accept service of process in any manner permitted by
such courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure lawfully to serve process, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such
suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

 **Section 12.6** **Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party
Rights**. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and
void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
permitted assigns and

 



      
 

 



 

legal representatives. Except as expressly provided in _Section 6.7_ and
_Section 12.14_ of this Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective heirs, successors, permitted
assigns and legal representatives and is not intended, nor shall be construed,
to give any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the
Effective Time, each holder of Common Stock or Company Options shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions of _ARTICLE II_ to the extent necessary
to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _ARTICLE III_.

 



 

 **Section 12.7** **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts for the convenience of the Parties hereto, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a mutually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.8** **Titles and Headings**. The titles, captions and table of
contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in
any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.9** **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, including the
Schedules attached thereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the matters covered hereby
and supersede all previous written, oral or implied understandings among them
with respect to such matters.

 



 

 **Section 12.10** **Severability**. The invalidity of any portion hereof
shall not affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions
hereof. If it is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to
permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction
shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

 



 

 **Section 12.11** **No Strict Construction**. The Parties have participated
jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.12** **Waiver of Jury Trial**. Each of the Parties hereto
waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation
based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any
course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of
any Party hereto.

 



 

 **Section 12.13** **Failure or Indulgence not Waiver**. At any time prior
to the Effective Time, the Parties may, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors or similar governing body, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other Parties contained in this Agreement or any

 



      
 

 



 

document delivered pursuant hereto or (b) subject to applicable law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such Party. No failure or
delay on the part of any Party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

 



 

 **Section 12.14** **Legal Representation; Waiver of Conflicts**.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) covenants and agrees that, following the Closing, Jenner and Block
LLP ( " _Prior Company Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to the Stockholders
and their Affiliates, in connection with any matters arising under or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including with respect to any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, notwithstanding any representation by the Prior Company Counsel
prior to the Closing Date of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby
irrevocably (i) waive any claim they have or may have that Prior Company
Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in
such representation and (ii) covenant and agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Stockholder or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Prior Company Counsel may represent
the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or its Subsidiaries and even though Prior Company Counsel may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such dispute.

 



 

(c) All communications between the Stockholders, the Company or its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior
Company Counsel, on the other hand, related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to such Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (excluding
the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the " _Seller Pre-Closing Communications_
"). Accordingly, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have access to any
such Seller Pre-Closing Communications or to the files of Prior Company
Counsel relating to such engagement from and after the Closing, and all books,
records and other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any medium
(including electronic copies) containing or reflecting any of the Seller Pre-
Closing Communications or the work product of legal counsel with respect
thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses, and all rights
with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby assigned and transferred as
designated by the Stockholders effective as of the Closing (collectively, the
" _Seller Privileged Materials_ "). From and after the Closing, Parent, Merger
Sub, its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of the Seller Privileged
Materials. From and after the Closing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, their
Affiliates, the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective

 



      
 

 



 

representatives shall access or in any way, directly or indirectly, use or
rely upon any Seller Privileged Materials. To the extent that any Seller
Privileged Materials are not delivered to the Stockholders, the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) agrees not to assert a waiver of any
applicable privilege or protection, and will deliver all such Seller
Privileged Materials to the Stockholders promptly upon discovery thereof,
without retaining copies thereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) the Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be
the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Seller
Privileged Materials, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be a
holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Prior Company Counsel in
respect of Seller Privileged Materials constitute property of the client, only
the Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (excluding the Company and
its Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (c) Prior Company
Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Seller
Privileged Materials to the Company or its Subsidiaries by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Prior Company Counsel and the Company or
its Subsidiaries, or otherwise. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledges and confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and
obtain adequate information regarding the significance and risks of the
waivers and other terms and conditions of this _Section 12.14_, including the
opportunity to discuss with counsel such matters and reasonable alternatives
to such terms. The covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section
12.14_ shall survive for ten (10) years following the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 12.14_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Stockholders and Prior Company Counsel,
who are third party beneficiaries of this _Section 12.14_.

 



 

 **Section 12.15** **Amendments**. This Agreement may be amended, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, by action taken by the respective boards of
directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement (including the
provisions of this _Section 11.1_) may not be amended or modified except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the Parties required
pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided, however, that, after the
adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders, no amendment shall be made
except as allowed under applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 12.16** **Release**. Effective as of the Closing Date (but only if
the Closing actually occurs), except for any rights or obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Merger Documents, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, on
behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries and its past, present or future
officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, stockholders, equity holders, controlling
Persons, representatives or Affiliates, or any heir, executor, administrator,
successor or assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Releasing
Parties_ "), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever
discharges the Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (excluding the
Company and its Subsidiaries), and each of the foregoings respective past,
present or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited
partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders, equity
holders, controlling Persons, representatives or Affiliates, or any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Released_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Parties_ ") of and from any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds,
contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and claims and demands
whatsoever whether in law or in equity (whether based upon contract, tort or
otherwise) which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released
Parties, now or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or
thing relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or any actions taken or
failed to be taken by any of the Released Parties relating to any Released
Partys capacity as (i) a direct or indirect equityholder of the Company or
(ii) a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case
for any actions taken or failed to be taken by any Released Party occurring or
arising on or prior to the date of this Agreement, but only to the extent that
such cause, matter or thing does not otherwise constitute fraud. The
provisions of this _Section 12.16_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Released Parties, who are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 12.16_.

 



 

 **Section 12.17** **Limitation on Recourse**. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, no claim arising in whole or in
part out of or related to this Agreement, the negotiation, interpretation,
construction, validity or enforcement of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise) shall be brought or maintained by or on behalf of any Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or their respective
successors or permitted assigns against any Person not a Party. Without
limitation of the foregoing, no claim described in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be brought or maintained against any past, present or future
officer, director, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
management company, member, stockholder, equity holder, controlling Person,
representative or Affiliate, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor
or assign of any of the foregoing, of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
(including its Subsidiaries) or the Stockholders, unless such Person is a
Party, and no recourse shall be had against any of them in respect of any such
claim, including in connection with any alleged misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in or breach of or omission in any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of any Party set forth or contained in
this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 12.18** **Enforcement**. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
all such actions as are necessary or required of them hereunder to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _ARTICLE VIII_, (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement
or at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the
other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance

 



      
 

 



 

is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (the "
_Prohibited Defenses_ "). The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 12.18_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy. To the extent
any Party brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to specifically
enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement)
when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
20th Business Day following the resolution of such action, or (ii) such other
time period established by the arbiter (or court) presiding over such action.

 

        
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement and Plan of
Merger to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

ARTICLE I _ 

_

 

 _Stockholders_

 



 

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within
or without the State of Delaware, or may not be held at any place, but may
instead be held solely by means of remote communication, as may be designated
by the Board of Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be
transacted at the annual meeting.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, the
Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, the President or the Board, to be held
at such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware,
or may not be held at any place, but may instead be held by means of remote
communication, as may be stated in the notice of the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the
meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given
not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to
each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. In addition, if
stockholders have consented to receive notices by a form of electronic
transmission, then such notice, by facsimile telecommunication, or by
electronic mail, shall be deemed to be given when directed to a number or an
electronic mail address, respectively, at which the stockholder has consented
to receive notice. If such notice is transmitted by a posting on an electronic
network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific
posting, such notice shall be deemed to be given upon the later of (i) such
posting, and (ii) the giving of such separate notice. If such notice is
transmitted by any other form of electronic transmission, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when directed to the stockholder. Notice shall be deemed to
have been given to all stockholders of record who

      
 

 



 

share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding"
rules set forth in Section 233 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. For
purposes of these by-laws, "electronic transmission" means any form of
communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that
creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient
thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form through an
automated process.

 



 

Section 1.4. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time,
place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any,
thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the
adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these by-
laws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to
vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any
class of stock entitled to vote on a matter, either (i) the holders of such
class so present or represented may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting of
such class from time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these
by-laws until a quorum of such class shall be so present or represented or
(ii), the Chairperson of the meeting may on his or her own motion adjourn the
meeting from time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these by-
laws until a quorum of such class shall be so present and represented without
the approval of the stockholders who are present in person or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting to the Corporation or
to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to
its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or in the absence of the
Chairperson of the Board by the Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in
the absence of the Vice Chairperson of the Board by the President, or in the
absence of the President by a Vice President, or in the absence of the
foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board, or in the absence
of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The Corporate
Secretary, or in the absence of the Corporate Secretary an Assistant
Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the
Corporate Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairperson of the meeting
may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the
chairperson of the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting shall have the
right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation,
restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the
commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls, for each
item on which a vote is to be taken. In addition to the foregoing, the
chairperson shall have the authority to recess each such meeting for such
length of time as he or she believes is reasonably necessary for the purpose
of promoting the successful completion of the items of business of the
meeting.

 



 

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking
the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the
Corporate Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written
ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all
classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by
proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. In all other
matters, unless otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of
incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and
which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before
the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also
be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date,
that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record
date for determining

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix the
record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the
same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.8 at the adjourned meeting.

 



 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and
which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date
has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action by the Board is required by law, shall be the first date on which
a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be
taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in
the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent
of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings
of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by
the Board is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution
taking such prior action.

 



 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Corporate
Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the meeting date,
the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day
before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. Nothing in this Section shall require the Corporation to
include electronic

 



      
 

 



 

mail addresses or other electronic content information on such list. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to
the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and
kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and
may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be
held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation or by law, any action required by
law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a)
its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified mail or
registered mail, return receipt requested, (b) its principal place of
business, or (c) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the
book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every
written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs
the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated
consent delivered in the manner required by this by-law to the Corporation,
written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its registered office in the
State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, (b) its principal place of business, or (c) an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded.

 



 

A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action
to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder, member or proxyholder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder, member or proxyholder,
shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this
Section 1.10, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
Corporation can determine (a) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission was transmitted by the stockholder, member or proxyholder or by a
person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder, member or proxyholder
and (b) the date on which such stockholder, member or

 



      
 

 



 

proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its registered office in the
State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, (b) its principal place of business, or (c) an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders or members are recorded. Notwithstanding the foregoing
limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission, may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of
business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders or
members are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by
resolution of the Board of Directors, these by-laws or certificate of
incorporation. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent
in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any
and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that
such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing.

 



 

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10.

resignation shall take effect at the time it is delivered unless the
resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined
upon the happening of an event or events. Unless otherwise specified therein
no acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. Any
director or

 



      
 

 



 

the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these by-
laws, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in
the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having
the right to vote as a single class or from any other cause may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by
the sole remaining director. Any director elected or appointed to fill a
vacancy shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders
and his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier
resignation or removal.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such
times as the Board may from time to time determine, and if so determined
notice thereof need not be given.

may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware
whenever called by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, by the Vice
Chairperson of the Board, if any, by the President or by any two directors.
Reasonable notice thereof shall be given by the person or persons calling the
meeting.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone Permitted_.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-
laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the
Board, may participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee, as the
case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of the
Board of Directors one-third of the entire Board shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present
at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board unless
the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall require a vote of a
greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board a quorum shall not be
present, the members of the Board present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum shall be present.

Section 2.8. _Action by Directors Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or
of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the
Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form.

certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the Board of Directors shall
have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.

 



 

ARTICLE III _ 

_

 

 _Committees_

 



 

Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member
of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board or in these
by-laws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board
in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may
authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may
require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in
reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending
to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal
of directors) expressly required by law to be submitted to stockholders for
approval, (ii) adopting, amending or repealing these by-laws or (iii)
indemnifying directors.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
provides, each committee designated by the Board may adopt, amend and repeal
rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by the
Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of
the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then
present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts
its business pursuant to Article II of these by-laws.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE IV _ 

_

 

 _Officers_

 



 

Section 4.1. _Officers; Election_. As soon as practicable after the annual
meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall elect a
Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Financial Officer, a Treasurer
and a Corporate Secretary. The Board may also elect one or more Vice
Presidents, one or more Executive Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant
Secretaries, and one or more Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as
the Board may deem desirable or appropriate and may give any of them such
further designations or alternate titles as it considers desirable. Any number
of offices may be held by the same person unless the certificate of
incorporation or these by-laws otherwise provide.

 



 

Section 4.2. _Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Unless
otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing any
officer, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer
may resign at any time upon written notice or electronic transmission to the
Board or to the President or the Corporate Secretary. Such resignation shall
take effect at the time it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a
later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an
event or events. Unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such
resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may remove any
officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall be without
prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the
Corporation, but the election of an officer shall not of itself create
contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise, may be filled by the Board at any
regular or special meeting.

 



 

Section 4.3. _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall have
such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be stated
in these by-laws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is not
inconsistent with these by-laws and, to the extent not so stated, as generally
pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the Board. The
Corporate Secretary shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the
meetings of the stockholders, the Board and any committees in a book to be
kept for that purpose. The Board may require any officer, agent or employee to
give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

 



 

ARTICLE V _ 

_

 

 _Stock_

 



 

Section 5.1. _Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of
stock in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that
the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or
all of any or all classes or series of the Corporations stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall

 



      
 

 



 

not apply to shares represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such
certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock
represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by
or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson of
the Board, if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer
or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary, of the Corporation, representing the number of shares of stock
registered in certificate form owned by such holder. If such certificate is
manually signed by one officer or manually countersigned by a transfer agent
or by a registrar, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be
such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person
were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The
Corporation may not issue stock certificates in bearer form.

 



 

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of
the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall
be identical.

 



 

Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or
uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by
it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such
owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

Section 6.2. _Seal_. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall
have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form
as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. The corporate
seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or
affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

 



 

Section 6.3. _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to

 



       
 

 



 

notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or
any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of
incorporation or these by-laws.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. Except as provided
in this by-law, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitees to the full extent
permitted by Delaware law. Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in
defending any action, suit, or proceeding, as described in this by-law, shall
be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation promptly upon receipt by it of an
undertaking of Indemnitee to repay such Expenses if it shall ultimately be
determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation. Indemnitees obligation to reimburse the Corporation shall be
unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.

 



 

No claim for indemnification shall be paid by the Corporation unless the
Corporation has determined that Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of
the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Unless
ordered by a court, such determinations shall be made by (1) a majority vote
of the directors who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding for
which indemnification or advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses is
sought, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such
directors designated by a majority vote of directors, even though less than a
quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by stockholders.

 



 

Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing upon the sooner of
(a) becoming aware of an action, suit or proceeding where indemnification or
the advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses may be sought or (b) being
served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment,
information or other document relating to any matter which may be subject to
indemnification or the advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses covered
hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Corporation shall not
relieve the Corporation of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee
pursuant to this by-law. No claim for indemnification or the advance payment
or reimbursement of Expenses shall be made by Indemnitee or paid by the
Corporation unless the Indemnitee gives notice to the Corporation in writing
of such claim for indemnification within six months after the Indemnitee
received notice of the claim, action, suit or proceeding arose under this
bylaw.

 



 

As a condition to indemnification or the advance payment or reimbursement of
Expenses, any demand for payment by Indemnitee hereunder shall be in writing
and shall provide reasonable accounting by Indemnitees legal counsel for the
Expenses to be paid by the Corporation.

made or threatened to be made a party, or otherwise involved in any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding by reason

services by, such director, officer or employee with respect to an employee
benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and action by a person with

by-law, penalties and all other disbursements or expenses of the types
customarily incurred in connection with defending, preparing to defend, or
investigating an actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding (including
Indemnitees counterclaims that directly respond to and negate the affirmative
claim made against Indemnitee ("Permitted Counterclaims") in such action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, but
shall exclude the costs of (a) any of Indemnitees counterclaims, other than
Permitted Counterclaims or (b) the fees and costs of enforcing a right to
indemnification or advance payment or reimbursement under this by-law.

 



 

Any action, suit or proceeding regarding indemnification or advance payment or
reimbursement of Expenses arising out of the by-laws or otherwise shall only
be brought and heard in Delaware Court of Chancery. In the event of any
payment under this by-law, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent
of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee (under any
insurance policy or otherwise), who shall execute all papers required and
shall do everything necessary to secure such rights, including the execution
of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation to effectively bring
suit to enforce such rights. Except as required by law or as otherwise becomes
public, Indemnitee will keep confidential any information that arises in
connection with this by-law, including but not limited to, claims for
indemnification or the advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses, amounts
paid or payable under this by-law and any communications between the parties.
No amendment of this by-law shall impair the rights of any Indemnitee arising
at any time with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.5. _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction
between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable
solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present
at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because such
directors or officers votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the
material facts as to directors or officers relationship or interest and as
to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the
committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(2) the material facts as to directors or officers relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation
in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of
account and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form
of, any information storage device, or method, provided that the records so
kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable
time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of
any person entitled to inspect such records in accordance with law.

 



 

Section 6.7. _Amendment of By-Laws_. These by-laws may be amended or
repealed, and new by-laws adopted, by the Board of Directors, but the
stockholders entitled to vote may adopt additional by-laws and may amend or
repeal any by-law whether or not adopted by them.
