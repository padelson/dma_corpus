   ##### 

  

    

for protection, and in accordance with procedures customarily used in the
industry to protect rights of like importance. To the Companys Knowledge,
there has been no unauthorized use or disclosure of any Intellectual Property
of the Company Group. All former and current officers, directors, employees,
personnel, consultants, advisors, agents, and independent contractors of the
members of the Company Group, and each of their predecessors, who have
contributed to or participated in the conception and development of
Intellectual Property material to or necessary for the conduct of the
Business as now conducted for any member of the Company Group have
entered into valid and binding proprietary rights agreements with the

 (a) Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate Tax authorities all material Tax Returns that are required to be filed by them. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries which are due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been timely paid. All material Taxes which the Buyer or its Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, independent contractor, service provider, creditor, stockholder or other Person have been withheld and timely paid to the proper Tax authorities. No claim has ever been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where a member of the Company Group does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to Tax by that jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) The unpaid Taxes of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). Since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with customary practice for similarly situated companies, excluding any Taxes that may arise as a result of the Mergers. 

   

 (c) No deficiencies for material Taxes with respect to the Buyer or its Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Tax authority. No issues relating to material Taxes of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period. 

   

 (d) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers, from qualifying as reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

   ##### 

  

    

Date will be: (i) in the case of Taxes other than income, sales and use and
withholding Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire

prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law or
regulation and (III) all Liabilities for Taxes of any Person (other than any
member of the Company Group) imposed on any member of the Company Group as a
transferee or successor, by Contract, by Law, or otherwise, in each case in
this clause (III), as a result of actions taken or failed to be taken or
Contracts entered into by any member of the Company Group on or prior to the
Closing Date; (iv) any payment of consideration in exchange for
any Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL, to the extent such payment is in
excess of the aggregate amount of the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration was attributable to the Dissenting Shares, and any Damages
incurred by the Buyer Group in connection with any litigation or
settlement relating to treatment of any Dissenting Shares; or (v) any and all
Excluded Liabilities, without duplication; and (b) any and all Damages
incurred by the Buyer Group based upon, relating to or arising out of (i) any
breach of any covenant of the Stockholder Representative contained in
this Agreement and (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Stockholder
Representatives representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
on the date hereof or on the Closing Date as though such representations and
warranties were made on and as of the date hereof and the Closing Date.
Except as otherwise set forth herein with respect to the Tier I Reps, the
Buyer Group will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Sections
10.1(a)(ii) _and  _(b)(ii)_ exclusively from the Indemnification Escrow
Account. So long as there are any Indemnification Escrow Shares and
Indemnification Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account, all Damages
indemnified under this _Article X_ shall be allocated among the
Indemnification Escrow Funds and the Indemnification Escrow Shares
attributable to each Selling Stockholder severally and not jointly with such
amounts to be allocated _pro rata_ in the same proportion used to pay the net
proceeds of the Merger Consideration (including pursuant to the Employee
Bonus Liquidity Plan). 

  

 Section 10.2. __General Indemnification for the Stockholder Group__. Following the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Selling Stockholder, their respective Affiliates (other than the Company Group) and each of their respective employees, directors, officers, agents, members and partners (collectively, the " _Stockholder Group_ ") from and against, any and all Damages incurred by any member of the Stockholder Group based upon, relating to, or arising out of: (a) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement; or (b) any breach of Buyers, Merger Sub 1s or Merger Sub 2s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement on the date hereof or on the Closing Date (except for such representations and warranties which by their express provisions are made as of an earlier date) as though such representations and warranties were made on and as of the date hereof and the Closing Date or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Sections 4.8(b)(v)_. Any party providing indemnification 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to this  _Article X_ is referred to herein as an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ", and any member of the Buyer Group or the Stockholder Group seeking
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ is referred to herein as an "
_Indemnified Party_." 

   

 Section 10.3. __Certain Limitations__. 

   

 (a) The (i) maximum aggregate Liability pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_ and  _10.1(b)(ii)_ , in the aggregate, of the Selling Stockholders, other than with respect to the Tier I Reps, shall in no event exceed the value of the consideration in the Indemnification Escrow Account and (ii) maximum aggregate Liability pursuant to _Article X_ of Buyer shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the net proceeds of the Merger Consideration actually paid to the Selling Stockholders. The maximum aggregate Liability, in the aggregate, of the Selling Stockholders together as a group, to the Buyer Group shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration actually paid to the Selling Stockholders and each individual Selling Stockholders indemnification obligation shall be several and not joint and in no event shall any Selling Stockholder be liable for Damages, in the aggregate, in an amount greater than the amount of the Merger Consideration, taken as a dollar amount with each share of the stock portion thereof being valued at the Buyer Common Stock Per Share Price, to be received by such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including, as applicable, amounts received pursuant to the Employee Bonus Liquidity Plan). For the avoidance of doubt, all liability of the Selling Stockholders shall be several and not joint and the maximum Liability of any Selling Stockholder in respect of any particular item of Damage for which indemnification is sought by any member of the Buyer Group in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement after the distribution of all of the Indemnification Escrow Shares and Indemnification Escrow Funds held by or for the account of such Selling Stockholder shall not exceed the result obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate monetary amount of such item of Damage by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate Merger Consideration issued or paid to such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to the Employee Bonus Liquidity Plan) and the denominator of which is the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Except with respect to Damages arising out of a breach of the Tier I Reps and the representations and warranties contained in _Sections_ _6.1_ , _6.2_ and  _6.6_ (and the certificates referred to above insofar as they relate to such Sections) (the " _Non-Threshold Damages_ "), notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no indemnification payment shall be made to the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_ or  _10.1(b)(ii)_ or to the Stockholder Group pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_, unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages sustained by the Buyer Group or the Stockholder Group, as the case may be, exceeds on a cumulative basis $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), at which time the full aggregate amount of the Damages sustained (including the full amount of Damages that were aggregated in calculating whether the Threshold had been reached) by the Buyer Group or the Stockholder Group, as the case may be, shall be paid. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed among the Parties that Non-Threshold Damages shall not be taken into account in determining whether the Threshold has been met for purposes of this _Section 10.3(b)_. 

   

 (c) Each and every representation and warranty of the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Sections  _4.8(a)(ii)_ , _4.8(a)(iii)_ and _4.8(b)(iii)_ shall survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of this _Article X_ until, and will expire upon, the conclusion of the Escrow Period, and 

   ##### 

  

 

no member of the Buyer Group or the Stockholder Group shall have any
Liability whatsoever with respect to any such representations and warranties
thereafter, except with respect to claims made in accordance with the terms
hereof prior to the conclusion of the Escrow Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Tier I Reps shall survive the Closing Date solely for
purposes of this _Article X_ until, and will expire on, the date that is the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, other than with respect to claims made
prior to such expiration. Each and every covenant contained in this Agreement
will survive the Closing Date until, and will expire when, in each case, the
applicable statute of limitations has expired. 

    

 (d) The obligations of each Party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and other Persons pursuant to this _Agreement (including, without limitation, this Article X)_ shall terminate (other than with respect to claims made prior to expiration) with respect to _Sections 10.1_ and _10.2_ upon the expiration of the applicable survival periods as set forth in _Section 10.3(c)_. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations hereunder shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Damages. Any amounts payable to the Buyer Group as Damages pursuant to this Agreement shall first be paid from the Escrow Account, to the extent available, and shall thereafter be paid directly (severally and not jointly) by the Selling Stockholders in accordance with the limitations set forth in  _Section 10.3(a)_. In calculating Damages for purposes of this Article X, any materiality qualifiers (including Material Adverse Effect) contained in the applicable representation and warranty shall be deemed to be deleted and shall be given no force or effect. 

   

 (f) The amount of any Damages with respect to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall be net of the amount of any insurance proceeds or contributions from third parties actually recovered by such Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages; _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Person shall have any obligation or duty to seek to recover any such insurance proceeds of contributions from third parties. 

   

 (g) The Parties agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment of the Merger Consideration for Tax and, if applicable, other purposes and to take no position contrary thereto on Tax Returns, unless otherwise required by Law. 

  

 Section 10.4. __Indemnification Procedures__. (a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party with respect to any matter, or any Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of an assertion or of a potential claim, by any Person who is not a Party (or an Affiliate thereof) (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, then the Indemnified Party shall as promptly as practicable send notice in writing and in reasonable detail of the Third Party Claim (including the factual basis for the Third Party Claim, and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim) to (i) the Stockholder Representative, in the event the Indemnifying Party is a member of the Stockholder Group, or (ii) Buyer, in the event the Indemnifying Party is a member of the Buyer Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any 

   ##### 

  

 

obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof; it being understood and
agreed that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party prior to settling a Third Party Claim (whether by paying a
claim or executing a binding settlement agreement with respect thereto) or
the entry of a judgment or issuance of an award with respect to a Third Party
Claim shall constitute actual prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys ability
to defend against such Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
will deliver to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received or transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party
Claim. 

    

 (b) The Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in or to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). Should the Indemnified Party elect not to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense of such claim, and will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if an Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after having elected not to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, that a conflict of interest exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel to represent such Indemnified Party and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate counsel and local counsel for all Indemnified Parties) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that the Indemnified Party will control such defense. 

   

 (c) The Stockholder Representative will not admit any Liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the applicable member of the Buyer Group that is the Indemnified Party, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer will not admit any Liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (d) If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the Parties will cooperate fully and in good faith in the defense thereof (with the Indemnifying Party being responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Party in connection with such cooperation), which cooperation will include (except where a conflict exists) the provision to the Indemnified Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnified Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third Party 

   ##### 

  

    

Claim, the Indemnified Partys obligations of information and cooperation
under this _Section 10.4 (d)_ shall apply to the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (e) Any claim on account of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (f) If there is any conflict between the provisions of this _Section 10.4_ and the provisions of _Section 8.3_ with respect to Tax Contests, the provisions of _Section 8.3_ shall govern with respect to Tax Contests. 

  

 Section 10.5. __Exclusive Remedy__. The remedies set forth in this _Article X_ and  _Section 7.8_ shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy with respect to any and all claims relating directly or indirectly hereto and/or the transactions contemplated herein other than claims for fraud; _provided_ _that_ nothing herein will limit equitable remedies for specific performance of the obligations hereunder and provided further that Buyers remedy in the case of claims for fraud shall be limited to the proceeds received by the Selling Stockholders severally and not jointly and any Selling Stockholder shall only be liable for amounts not to exceed the result obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate monetary amount of Damage caused by such fraud by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate Merger Consideration issued or paid to such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to the Employee Bonus Liquidity Plan) and the denominator of which is the Merger Consideration.. 

  

ARTICLE XI. 

   

 _TERMINATION_   

  

 Section 11.1. __Termination Events__. Subject to the terms hereof, without prejudice to other remedies which may be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: 

   

 (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer; 

   

 (b) by the Buyer or the Company, if the requisite approvals under the DGCL of the Buyer Stockholders or the stockholders of the Company are not obtained at the Buyer Stockholders Meeting or the Company Stockholders Meeting, respectively; 

   

 (c) by either the Company or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if the Closing shall not have occurred by January 9, 2009, unless extended by written agreement of the Company and Buyer; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (c) shall not be available to any Party whose failure or inability to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; 

   

 (d) by the Buyer upon a material breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.3_ hereof 

   ##### 

  

    

and such breach shall be incapable of being cured within sixty (60) days of
the occurrence thereof;  _provided, however,_ there shall be no right to
terminate if Buyer, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 is in material breach of its
representations and warranties under this Agreement or have failed in any
material respect to perform their obligations under this Agreement; 

   

 (e) by the Company upon a material breach by Buyer, Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.2_ hereof and such breach shall be incapable of being cured within sixty (60) days of the occurrence thereof; _provided, however,_ there shall be no right to terminate if the Company is in material breach of its representations and warranties under this Agreement or have failed in any material respect to perform their obligations under this Agreement; and 

   

 (f) by either the Company or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other Action shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable. 

  

 Section 11.2. __Effect of Termination__. In the event of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any Liability on the part of any Party or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates in respect thereof, except that (i) the obligations of Buyer, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company under _Section 7.2 _(Access to Information and Confidentiality), _Section 7.5_ (Public Announcements) and _Article XIII_ of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any Party of any Liability for any fraud, breach of an obligation or covenant or intentional breach of representation or warranty contained in this Agreement arising prior to termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and in no way in lieu of any other rights that any Party may have hereunder, in the event of a material breach of any of the terms hereof, the non-breaching Party shall have the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies against the breaching Party and their Affiliates.

 (a) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to any of the Selling Stockholders by Buyer pursuant hereto or to the Escrow Agreement or in connection herewith or therewith and to receive and accept service of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; 

   

 (b) Deliver to Buyer at the Closing all certificates to be delivered to Buyer by any of the Selling Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, together with any other certificates executed by any of the Selling Stockholders and deposited with the Stockholder Representative for such purpose; 

   

 (c) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors for any of the Selling Stockholders and incur such other expenses on behalf of any of the Selling Stockholders in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Stockholder Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate;

 All actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Selling Stockholders and no Selling Stockholder shall have any claim or cause of action against the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to any Selling Stockholder, for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the Escrow Agreement, or this Agreement, except in the case of his own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

   ##### 

  

 

Stockholder Representatives consenting to, compromising or settling any Buyer
Indemnity Claims hereof be deemed to constitute an adverse change in the
Merger Consideration, so long as such consent, compromise or settlement does
not treat a Selling Stockholder in a manner different from other Selling
Stockholders.. 

   

 Section 12.5. __Buyer s Reliance__. Buyer shall not be obliged to inquire into the authority of the Stockholder Representative, and Buyer shall be fully protected in dealing with the Stockholder Representative in good faith.

 Section 13.1. __Parties in Interest__. Except as provided in _Article X_ with respect to the rights of the members of Buyer Group or the Stockholder Group to receive indemnification hereunder and _Section 7.7_ of this Agreement which is for the benefit of the officers and directors of the Company nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy, claim or benefit under or in respect of this Agreement.

This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (including by waiver) except in a written instrument executed by each of the Parties; provided, that the Parties shall not have the authority to amend or waive any provisions of this Agreement if such amendment or waiver shall (a) create further obligations of a Selling Stockholder under the terms of this Agreement, (b) adversely change the Merger Consideration due to a Selling Stockholder without the consent of the Selling Stockholder (including, without limitation, the requirement that registered tradable securities of Buyer, subject to the Lock-up Agreement, be delivered at the Closing of Merger 1) or (c) treat a Selling Stockholder in a manner different from other Selling Stockholders, in each case without the consent of the Selling Stockholder so affected; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Stockholder Representatives consenting to, compromising or settling any Buyer Indemnity Claims be deemed to constitute an adverse change in the Merger Consideration, so long as such consent, compromise or settlement does not treat a Selling Stockholder in a manner different from other Selling Stockholders. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

agrees that a final judgment in any Action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or
in any other manner provided in law or in equity.
