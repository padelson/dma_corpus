\- iii - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF AMALGAMATION

 

This Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of January 25, 2015, by and between Axis Capital Holdings
Limited, a Bermuda exempted company (" _Axis_ ") and PartnerRe Ltd., a Bermuda
exempted company (" _PRE_ " and, together with Axis, the " _parties_ ").

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Axis (the " _Axis Board_ ") and the Board
of Directors of PRE (the " _PRE Board_ ") have determined that a business
combination between Axis and PRE presents the opportunity for their respective
companies to achieve long-term financial and strategic benefits and
accordingly have determined to effect a business combination upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that PRE and Axis will amalgamate (the "
_Amalgamation_ ") and continue as a Bermuda exempted company (the "
_Amalgamated Company_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and a statutory amalgamation agreement in a form to be agreed
between the parties (the " _Amalgamation Agreement_ "), and in accordance with
the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the " _Companies Act_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Axis Board and the PRE Board have unanimously: (i) determined
that the Amalgamation is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
Axis and PRE, respectively; and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement, the
Amalgamation Agreement and the Transactions; and

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the
Amalgamation will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and
the regulations thereunder (the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), and that this
Agreement be, and be hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE AMALGAMATION

1.1 _The Amalgamation; Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, Axis
and PRE will cause an application for registration of the Amalgamated Company
(the " _Amalgamation Application_ ") to be prepared, executed and delivered to
the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under
S.108 of the Companies Act on or prior to the Closing Date and will cause the
Amalgamation to become effective pursuant to the Companies Act. The  Amalgamation shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of
amalgamation (the " _Certificate of Amalgamation_ ") by the Registrar or such
other time as the Certificate of Amalgamation may provide. The parties agree
that they will request the Registrar provide in the Certificate of
Amalgamation that the Effective Time will be 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Amalgamation (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the
offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York, at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ")
that is the third Business Day after the day on which the last of those
conditions (other than any conditions set forth in _Article VI_ that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement, or at such other place and time or on such other date as Axis and
PRE may agree in writing.

 

1.3 _Effects of the Amalgamation_. As of the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, Axis
shall be amalgamated with PRE and the Amalgamated Company shall continue after
the Amalgamation. The parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of
Bermuda Law: (i) the Amalgamation shall be effected so as to constitute
an "amalgamation" in accordance with S.104 of the Companies Act, and (ii) the
Amalgamated Company shall be deemed to be an "amalgamated company" as such
term is understood under the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, from and
after the Effective Time: (a) the Amalgamation of Axis and PRE and their
continuance as one company shall become effective; (b) the property of each of
Axis and PRE shall become the property of Amalgamated Company; (c)
Amalgamated Company shall continue to be liable for the obligations and
liabilities of each of Axis and PRE; (d) any existing cause of action, claim
or liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; (e) a civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding pending by or against Axis or PRE may be
continued to be prosecuted by or against Amalgamated Company; and (f) a
conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, Axis
or PRE may be enforced by or against Amalgamated Company.

1.4 _Amalgamated Company Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws_. The
memorandum of association and the bye-laws of the Amalgamated Company
(respectively, the " _Amalgamated Company Memorandum of Association_ " and the
" _Amalgamated Company Bye-Laws_ ") shall be in the form to be mutually agreed
by Axis and PRE no later than the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement ,
which shall contain the terms set forth on _Section 1.4_ of each partys
Disclosure Letter (as each may thereafter be amended or modified from time to
time after the date hereof and prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement by the mutual written agreement of the parties).

1.5 _Governance; Directors and Officers of Axis_.

(a) The parties shall take all actions necessary to cause the number of
directors constituting the full Amalgamated Company board of directors (the "
_Amalgamated Company Board_ ") as of the Effective Time to be 14 and comprised
of: (i) seven directors designated by Axis prior to the Closing (the " _Axis
Board Designees_ ") _provided_ ,  _that_ , one such Axis Board Designee shall
be Albert Benchimol and (ii) seven directors designated by PRE (the

 



2  " _PRE Board Designees_ "), _provided_ , _that_ , one such PRE Board
Designee shall be Jean-Paul Montupet (such directors, collectively, the "
_Post-Closing Directors_ "). The Post-Closing Directors will serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the
Amalgamated Company.

 

(b) The parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary so that,
immediately after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company Board
shall designate the following six committees: (i) Audit, (ii) Risk, (iii)
Nominating and Corporate Governance, (iv) Finance; (v) Compensation and (vi)
Executive. Each committee of the Amalgamated Company Board shall be composed
of Post-Closing Directors drawn equally from the Axis Board Designees and PRE
Board Designees who shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or
such other time that the Amalgamated Company Board after the Closing
determines to reconstitute or eliminate such committee, in each case in
accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Amalgamated Company. At the Effective
Time, the initial chairpersons of the Risk, Nominating and Corporate
Governance and Compensation committees of the Amalgamated Company Board shall
have been designated by the Axis Board in its sole discretion and the
chairpersons of the Audit, Finance and Executive committees of
the Amalgamated Company Board shall have been designated by the PRE Board in
its sole discretion, all such initial chairpersons to serve until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed or such other time that the Amalgamated Company Board
after the Closing determines to reconstitute or eliminate such committee, in
each case in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Amalgamated Company.

 

(c) The parties shall take all actions necessary so that immediately after the
Effective Time: (i) Albert Benchimol shall be appointed as the President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Amalgamated Company to serve until the earlier
of his resignation or removal in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the
Amalgamated Company, (ii) Jean-Paul Montupet shall be elected as the
chairman of the Amalgamated Company Board to serve until the earlier of his
resignation or removal in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Amalgamated
Company and (iii) the Bye-Laws of the Amalgamated Company shall provide (x)
that until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing, the affirmative vote
of 75% of the then Amalgamated Company Board (excluding interested directors,
employees and officers of the Amalgamated Company) will be required to remove
Mr. Benchimol or Mr. Montupet from such roles (y) that any amendments to the
provisions described in (x) above shall require the affirmative vote of 75% of
the then Amalgamated Company Board (excluding interested directors, employees
and officers of the Amalgamated Company) and (z) for a staggered board.

 



3 ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

2.1 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without
any action on the part of the holders of any share capital of Axis or PRE:

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each common share of: (i) PRE, par value $1.00 per
share (a " _PRE Common Share_ ") that is owned by PRE, Axis or by any
respective Subsidiary of PRE or Axis immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) Axis, par value $0.0125 per share (an " _Axis Common Share_ ") that
is owned by PRE, Axis or by any respective Subsidiary of PRE or Axis
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any PRE Common Shares
held by a wholly owned Subsidiary of PRE or Axis Common Shares held by a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Axis) (collectively (i) and (ii), the " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no PRE
Consideration or Axis Consideration shall be delivered in respect of the
Excluded Shares.

 

(b) _Conversion of PRE Common Shares_. Each PRE Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded
Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive 2.18 (the " _PRE Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable common shares of the Amalgamated Company, par value
$0.0125 per share (each, an " _Amalgamated Company Common Share_ "), together
with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section
2.2(g)_ (collectively, the " _PRE Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, all PRE Common Shares shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease
to exist and the holders of PRE Common Shares (the " _PRE Shareholders_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such PRE Common
Shares, except: (i) in the case of the PRE Common Shares (other than Excluded
Shares), the right to receive the PRE Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, and (ii) in the case of the PRE Dissenting Shares that are PRE
Common Shares, the right to receive the excess, if any, of the fair value
thereof as determined in accordance with (and subject to the terms and
conditions of) _Section 2.1(f)_ over the PRE Consideration.

 

(c) _Conversion of Axis Common Shares_. Each Axis Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded
Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive one Amalgamated Company Common Share (the " _Axis Exchange Ratio_ "),
together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2(g)_ (collectively, the " _Axis Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all Axis Common Shares shall be canceled automatically and
shall cease to exist and the holders of Axis Common Shares (the " _Axis
Shareholders_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Axis
Common Shares, except: (i) in the case of the Axis Common Shares (other than
the Excluded Shares), the right to receive the Axis Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.2_, and (ii) in the case of the Axis
Dissenting Shares that are Axis Common Shares, the additional right to receive
the excess, if any, of the fair value thereof as determined in accordance with
(and subject to the terms and conditions of) _Section 2.1(e)_ over the Axis
Consideration.

(d) _Certain Adjustments_. The Axis Consideration and the PRE Consideration
(collectively, the " _Consideration_ ") shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully and equitably the effect of any share split, reverse share
split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue, share
dividend (including any dividend or similar distribution of securities
convertible into Axis Common Shares or PRE Common Shares, as the case may be),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar
event that occurs between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
with respect to Axis Common Shares or PRE Common Shares in order to provide
the Axis Shareholders and the PRE Shareholders with the 

 



4  same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation
Agreement prior to any such event; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing in this
_Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit PRE or Axis to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement or the Amalgamation Agreement.

 

(e) _Shares of Axis Dissenting Holders_. At the Effective Time any Axis
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, and unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, be converted into the right to receive the Axis Consideration
as described in _Section 2.1(c)_ or, as the case may be, the preferred shares
of the Amalgamated Company described in _Section 2.1(g)_ and any Axis
Dissenting Holders, in the event that the fair value of an Axis Dissenting
Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda, under Section 106(6) of
the Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is greater than the Axis
Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from the Amalgamated
Company by payment within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is
finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. Axis shall give
PRE: (i) prompt notice of (A) any demands for appraisal of Axis Dissenting
Shares or withdrawals of such demands received by Axis and (B) to the extent
that Axis has Knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for
appraisal of the fair value of the Axis Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with Axis
in, and to be regularly consulted by Axis with respect to, any settlement
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any written demands for
appraisal under the Companies Act. Neither PRE nor Axis shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party (such written consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle, or offer to settle, any demands or applications for appraisal
pursuant to this _Article II_.

(f)  _Shares of PRE Dissenting Holders_. At the Effective Time any PRE
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, and unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, be converted into the right to receive the PRE Consideration
as described in  _Section 2.1(b)_ or, as the case may be, the preference
shares of the Amalgamated Company as described in _Section 2.1(g)_ and any
PRE Dissenting Holders, in the event that the Appraised Fair Value of a PRE
Dissenting Share is greater than the PRE Consideration, be entitled to
receive such difference from the Amalgamated Company by payment within thirty
(30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to
such appraisal procedure. PRE shall give Axis: (i) prompt notice of (A) any
demands for appraisal of PRE Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands
received by PRE and (B) to the extent that PRE has Knowledge, any applications
to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the PRE
Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
opportunity to participate with PRE in, and to be regularly consulted by PRE
with respect to, any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any written demands for appraisal under the Companies Act.

(g) _Preferred Shares_. Each share of the PRE Preferred Shares and Axis
Preferred Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as preferred shares of the Amalgamated Company and shall be
entitled to the same dividend and other relative rights,
preferences, limitations and restrictions as are now provided by the
respective certificate of designation, preferences and rights of such PRE
Preferred Shares or Axis Preferred Shares, respectively.

 



5 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
Axis and PRE shall jointly designate an exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of: (i) exchanging share certificates registered in
the name of a PRE Shareholder and representing PRE Common Shares (each, a "
_PRE Certificate_ ") or PRE Common Shares registered in the register of
shareholders of PRE (the " _PRE Share Register_ ") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Uncertificated PRE Common Shares_ "), and (ii)
exchanging share certificates registered in the name of an Axis Shareholder
and representing Axis Common Shares (each, an " _Axis Certificate_ ") or Axis
Common Shares registered in the register of shareholders of Axis (the " _Axis
Share Register_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Uncertificated Axis Common Shares_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this _Article II_
certificates or shares in book-entry form representing an aggregate number of
Amalgamated Company Common Shares to be exchanged in the Amalgamation pursuant
to _Sections 2.1(b)_ and _2.1(c)_. As may be necessary from time to time
following the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent any dividends or distributions to
which the PRE Shareholders and the Axis Shareholders may be entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.2(e)_ in an amount sufficient to pay such dividends or
distributions. Such Axis Consideration, PRE Consideration and other amounts so
deposited pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_ are hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit
of the respective holders of the PRE Certificates, Uncertificated PRE Common
Shares, Axis Certificates or Uncertificated Axis Common Shares on cash amounts
payable from the Exchange Fund pursuant to this  _Section 2.2_.

(c) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by the Amalgamated Company; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in either direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed
by, the United States of America or in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by an internationally recognized
credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to the Amalgamated
Company and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Sections
2.1(b)_ and _(c)_ shall be promptly returned to the Amalgamated Company. To
the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or
such cash in the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash payment of amounts under
_Sections 2.2(e)_ and(g), the Amalgamated Company shall promptly replace or
restore the cash to the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that there is
sufficient cash for the Exchange Agent to make all such payments.

(d) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than five Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Amalgamated
Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to: (1) each PRE Shareholder of
record of PRE Common Shares converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_: (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall be in form and substance as the parties
may reasonably specify at least three Business Days prior to the

 



6  Effective Time, including that delivery shall be effective upon the proper
delivery of the PRE Certificates or, in the case of Uncertificated PRE Common
Shares, pursuant to customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents" message in accordance with the instructions set forth therein), and
(ii) instructions to effect the surrender of PRE Certificates or
Uncertificated PRE Common Shares in exchange for the PRE Consideration, and
(2) each Axis Shareholder of record of Axis Common Shares converted pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in form and
substance as the parties may reasonably specify at least three Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, including that delivery shall be effective upon
the proper delivery of the Axis Certificates or, in the case of Uncertificated
Axis Common Shares, pursuant to customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agents" message in accordance with the instructions set forth
therein), and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of Axis Certificates
or Uncertificated Axis Common Shares in exchange for the Axis Consideration.
Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the PRE Common Shares
previously held by a PRE Shareholder in accordance with this _Section 2.2_,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, a PRE Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) a certificate or book-entry
representing that number of whole Axis Common Shares (rounded down) which such
PRE Shareholder has the right to receive as PRE Consideration payable in
respect thereof and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such
shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_, and any
PRE Certificate so surrendered shall be marked as cancelled immediately. In
the event that the PRE Consideration is to be paid to a Person that is not
registered in the transfer records of PRE, a certificate or book-entry
representing the PRE Consideration may be issued to such Person if: (i) the
PRE Certificate representing such PRE Common Shares (if any) is presented to
the Exchange Agent, (ii) all documents so required to evidence and effect such
transfer that are reasonably satisfactory to the Amalgamated Company are
presented to the Exchange Agent and (iii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Amalgamated Company is presented confirming that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender
of title to the Axis Common Shares previously held by an Axis Shareholder in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, an Axis Shareholder shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor: (A) a certificate or book-entry representing that number of
whole Axis Common Shares (rounded down) which such Axis Shareholder has the
right to receive as Axis Consideration payable in respect thereof and (B) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares that such shareholder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_, and any Axis Certificate so surrendered
shall be marked as cancelled immediately. In the event that the Axis
Consideration is to be paid to a Person that is not registered in the transfer
records of Axis, a certificate or book-entry representing the Axis
Consideration may be issued to such Person if: (1) the Axis Certificate as
applicable, representing such Axis Common Shares (if any) is presented to the
Exchange Agent, (2) all documents so required to evidence and effect such
transfer that are reasonably satisfactory to the Amalgamated Company
are presented to the Exchange Agent and (3) evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Amalgamated Company is presented confirming that any applicable share
transfer taxes have been paid.

 

(e) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Amalgamated Company Common
Shares with a record date on or following the Effective Time shall be paid to
any holder of any unexchanged

 



7  PRE Certificate, Uncertificated PRE Common Shares, unexchanged Axis
Certificate, or Uncertificated Axis Common Shares with respect to PRE Common
Shares or Axis Common Shares (as the case may be) represented thereby, nor
shall the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_, until such holder has exchanged such PRE
Certificate, Uncertificated PRE Common Shares, unexchanged Axis Certificate,
or Uncertificated Axis Common Shares in accordance with the instructions and
procedures set forth in this _Article II_. Following such exchange, such
former PRE Shareholder or Axis Shareholder (as the case may be) shall
be entitled to receive, in addition to their applicable Consideration,
without interest: (i) at the time of such exchange, any dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or following the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole Amalgamated Company Common
Shares and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole Amalgamated Company
Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to the date of the exchange.

(f) _No Further Rights in Common Shares_. All PRE Consideration or other cash
amounts received or paid upon the surrender of title to PRE Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such PRE
Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the PRE Share Register shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share
transfer books of the Amalgamated Company of the PRE Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any outstanding PRE Common Shares are presented to the Amalgamated
Company or the Exchange Agent, such Common Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged for PRE Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
provisions set forth, in this Article II. All Axis Consideration or other cash
amounts received or paid upon the surrender of title to the Axis Common Shares
in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Axis Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the Axis Share Register
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the share transfer books of the Amalgamated Company of the Axis Common Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any outstanding Axis Common Shares are presented to the
Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent, such Common Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged for Axis Consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the provisions set forth, in this Article II.

 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of an Amalgamated Company Common Share shall be issued
in connection with the Amalgamation. In lieu thereof, any PRE Shareholder or
Axis Shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of an
Amalgamated Company Common Share, shall be paid upon surrender of
their respective PRE Common Shares or Axis Common Shares for exchange (after
aggregating all PRE Common Shares or Axis Common Shares of such Person), cash
in an amount (without interest) equal to the difference of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Amalgamated Company Common Stock to be delivered to the
Exchange Agent by Amalgamated Company pursuant to Section 2.2(b) minus (ii)
the aggregate number of whole shares of Amalgamated Company Common Stock to be
distributed, in aggregate, to the Axis Shareholders and the PRE Shareholders
pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) and (c) (such excess being, the "Excess Shares").
The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of 

 



8  issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Amalgamated Company that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the
certificates representing shares of Amalgamated Company Common Stock that
would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at
then prevailing prices on the NYSE. Such sale of the Excess Shares by the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders that would otherwise receive
fractional shares, shall be executed on the NYSE at then-prevailing market
prices and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the respective PRE
Shareholders and Axis Shareholders (as the case may be), the Exchange Agent
shall hold such proceeds in trust for such shareholders (the "Common Share
Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall reasonably determine the portion of the
Common Share Trust to which the respective PRE Shareholders and Axis
Shareholders (as the case may be) shall be entitled on a pro rata basis.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any PRE Certificates or Axis
Certificates (as the case may be) have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed PRE Certificates or Axis Certificates (as the case may be), upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming to be the
holder thereof, the respective Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to this _Article II_ in respect thereof; 
_provided_ that the Amalgamated Company may, in its reasonable discretion,
require such Person to either deliver a bond in such sum as the Amalgamated
Company may reasonably direct or otherwise indemnify the Amalgamated Company
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Amalgamated Company against any
claim that may be made against the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the PRE Certificates or Axis Certificates (as the case may be)
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the respective PRE Shareholders or Axis Shareholders
for 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Amalgamated Company, upon demand. Any respective holder of PRE Common Shares
or Axis Common Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
II_ shall thereafter look only to the Amalgamated Company for payment of their
respective Consideration and any cash dividends or distributions with respect
to Axis Common Shares or PRE Common Shares payable pursuant to this _Article
II_.

(j) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable to any PRE
Shareholder or Axis Shareholder in accordance with this _Article II_ that
remains undistributed to the respective PRE Shareholder and Axis Shareholder
shall be delivered to and become the property of the Amalgamated Company on
the Business Day immediately prior to the day that such property is required
to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Neither the Amalgamated Company nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any respective PRE Shareholder or Axis
Shareholder for any such property delivered to the Amalgamated Company or to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. 

 



9 (k) _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent, Axis, PRE and the Amalgamated
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Consideration or
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any PRE Shareholder or
Axis Shareholder such amounts as may be required under the Code or any other
provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
respective PRE Shareholder or Axis Shareholder in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made.

2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

(a) _Treatment of PRE Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase PRE Common Shares under any PRE Share Plan (each, a " _PRE
Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with
the terms of the applicable grant or award agreement and PRE Share Plan and,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into an option to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such PRE Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of whole Amalgamated Company Common
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the number
of PRE Common Shares subject to such PRE Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the PRE Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
Amalgamated Company Common Share (rounded up to the nearest whole penny)
equal to the exercise price for each such PRE Common Share subject to such PRE
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the PRE Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , that in the case of any PRE Option to which Section 421
of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of Amalgamated
Company Common Shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

 

(b) _Treatment of PRE Share Appreciation Rights_. As of the Effective Time,
each outstanding share appreciation right under any PRE Share Plan (each, a "
_PRE SAR_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with
the terms of the applicable grant or award agreement and PRE Share Plan and,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a share appreciation right, on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such PRE SAR immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to the number of whole Amalgamated Company Common Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the number of PRE Common Shares
subject to such PRE SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the PRE Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per Amalgamated Company Common
Share (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the exercise price for
each such PRE Common Share subject to such PRE SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the PRE Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) _Treatment of PRE Other Company Share-Based Awards_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive PRE Common Shares (including restricted
share units and performance share units), other than PRE Options and PRE SARS
(each, a

 



10  " _PRE Other Share-Based Award_ "), which under the terms of the applicable
grant or award agreement and PRE Share Plan becomes fully vested and settled
effective as of the Effective Time shall vest and be settled in accordance
with its terms (and for the avoidance of doubt, all such performance share
units shall vest and settle as if the maximum performance were achieved) and
each PRE Common Share delivered in settlement thereof (after giving effect to
any required reduction in respect of withholding tax obligation due in respect
of such vesting and settlement), shall be eligible to receive the PRE
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, any PRE Other Share-Based Awards held by members of the
PRE Board who are not PRE Board Designees shall be treated as if such
individuals experienced a termination due to mandatory retirement effective as
of the Effective Time under the terms of the applicable grant or award
agreement and PRE Share Plan.

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each PRE Other Share-Based
Award which is not vested as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a right to receive a number of Amalgamated Company Common
Shares determined by multiplying the number of PRE Common Shares subject to
such PRE Other Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the PRE Exchange Ratio and rounding up or down to the nearest whole share,
and such Amalgamated Company Common Shares subject to a PRE Other Share-Based
Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements) as applied to such PRE Other Share-Based Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Treatment of Axis Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Axis Common Shares under any Axis Share Plan (each, an "
_Axis Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an
option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements) as applied to each such Axis Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the number of whole Amalgamated Company Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the number of Axis
Common Shares subject to such Axis Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Axis Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
Amalgamated Company Common Share (rounded up to the nearest whole
penny) equal to the exercise price for each such Axis Common Share subject to
such Axis Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Axis
Exchange Ratio; provided, that in the case of any Axis Option to which Section
421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of
Amalgamated Company Common Shares subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

(e) _Treatment of Axis Restricted Share Awards_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each award of Axis Common Shares that is subject to
restrictions pursuant to the terms of an Axis Share Plan, (each, an " _Axis
Restricted Share Award_ "), shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an award
covering a number of Amalgamated Company Common Shares determined by
multiplying the number of Axis Common Shares subject to such Axis
Restricted Share Award

 



11  immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Axis Exchange Ratio and
rounding down to the nearest whole share, and such Amalgamated Company Common
Shares shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such Axis Restricted Share
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the time-vesting Axis Restricted Share Awards specially granted in
February 2014 to assistant vice presidents and above, as converted pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(e)_ shall, and any Axis Restricted Share Awards issued
pursuant to _Section 5.1(c)(C)_, as converted pursuant to this  _Section
2.3(e)_, may at Axiss option, as of the Effective Time and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
exercisable with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the
Amalgamated Company Common Shares subject to such Axis Restricted Share
Awards.

(f) _Treatment of Axis Other Share-Based Awards._

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive Axis Common Shares (including restricted
share units and performance share units), other than Axis Options (each, an "
_Axis Other Share-Based Award_ "), shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a
right to receive a number of Amalgamated Company Common Shares determined by
multiplying the number of Axis Common Shares subject to such Axis Other Share-
Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Axis
Exchange Ratio and rounding up or down to the nearest whole share, and such
Amalgamated Company Common Shares subject to the Axis Other Share-Based Award
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements) as applied to such Axis Other Share-Based Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any adjustment
made pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)(ii)_ of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the time-vesting Axis Other Share-Based Awards specially
granted in February 2014 to assistant vice presidents and above, as converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)(i)_ shall, and any Axis Other Share-Based
Awards issued pursuant to _Section 5.1(c)(C)_, as converted pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(f)(i)_, may at Axiss option, as of the Effective Time and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully
vested and exercisable with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the
Amalgamated Company Common Shares subject to such Axis Other Share-Based
Awards.

(ii) Prior to, and effective as of and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time, the Axis Board shall equitably adjust the performance criteria
applicable to any equity-based award outstanding under any Axis Share Plan, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Axis Share Plan and any
applicable grant or award agreements, to reflect the consummation of the
Amalgamation and to prevent any dilution or enlargement of achievement
opportunity with respect to such equity-based awards.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the PRE Board, Axis Board and their
respective compensation committees, shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.3_.

 



12 2.4 _Amendment of Structure_. The parties shall amend this Agreement prior to
the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement to provide for a structure other than
an amalgamation (with Axis or PRE surviving or continuing or both surviving or
continuing as subsidiaries of a new holding company, as the case may be) if
the advantages (after taking into account any disadvantages) of such other
structure would be more favorable after the Closing to the shareholders of PRE
and Axis than in the Amalgamation.

Axis at the Axis Shareholder Meeting; and (iv) determined that the Axis Bye-
Law Amendment is in the best interests of Axis, and authorized and approved
the Axis Bye-Law Amendment.

3.5 _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
it and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of it, enforceable against it in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency

Laws or Orders applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of
its assets or those of any of its Subsidiaries (" _Party Assets_ ") are bound,
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations, filings and
notifications described in  _Section 3.8_ have been obtained or made or, if
not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

purposes under such Purchase Plan. PRE shall terminate each Purchase Plan in

such service was recognized as of the Effective Time under a comparable plan
of the applicable entity in which the Continuing Employee participated.

efforts to cause the PRE Common Shares and the Axis Common Shares to be de-

to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and to
cause their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and

consummation of the Financing; provided that: (i) such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of a party and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) no party or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any financial liability under the
Financing prior to the Effective Time unless any such liability is contingent
upon the occurrence of the Closing and otherwise not material to Axis, PRE and

under, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (including an

tender offer or exchange offer by its respective shareholders (including, for
these purposes, by taking no position or a neutral position in respect of the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which
shall be deemed to be a failure to recommend against the acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer) within five Business Days after commencement
thereof (or in the event of a change in the terms of the tender offer
or exchange offer, within five Business Days of the announcement of such
changes), or (iv) fail to include the Axis Board Recommendation (in the case

constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be likely to result

Acquisition Proposal if, prior to furnishing such information, such party
receives from the third party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with

Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement, shall be
permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation, if: (A) the Axis Board or the
PRE Board (as the case may be) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that: (i) failure to
make such Change of Recommendation would violate the respective fiduciary
duties of the Axis Board or the PRE Board (as the case may be) under

from the party receiving the Superior Proposal (the " _Superior Proposal
Notice_ ") that includes such partys reasons for the Change in
Recommendation and the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal

sources (if applicable), the most current version of the proposed agreement
relating thereto and any agreement relating to such financing) that is the
basis of the proposed Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed

form or allocation of consideration) of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new five Business Day period during which
PRE or Axis (as applicable) shall comply with the terms of this _Section
5.8_), (2) during such five Business Day period (x) the Axis Board or the PRE
Board, as applicable, shall have provided the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to make any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Transactions so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to be

Superior Proposal Notice, continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make such a Change in Recommendation would violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws, and (3) the PRE Board or the Axis Board, as the
case may be, which is effecting such Change in Recommendation has not
materially breached its obligations under this _Section 5.8_.

disclosure, announcement or submission to PRE or Axis of any Acquisition
Proposal, as the case may be, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any and all
accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to
such Change of Recommendation if and to the extent the PRE Board or the Axis
Board, as the case may be, determines after consultation with outside legal
counsel

such Acquisition Proposal including without limitation in connection with any
approvals, except as required by applicable Law.

practicable, (ii) immediately take all steps necessary (to the extent
reasonably possible) to terminate any approval under any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar provision that may have been heretofore given by Axis
or PRE to any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) take the
necessary steps to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries Representatives

inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of

because the Requisite PRE Vote has not been obtained (and, if Axis is the

such termination, enters into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or publicly
announces, a Business Combination or consummates a Business Combination, then
PRE will, prior to the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination
or execution of a definitive agreement with respect thereto, also pay to Axis
or its designee, in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account designated by Axis, the Termination Fee _less_ the No Approval Fee.

 

(e) If either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_

adjournment or postponement thereof) was not obtained, and (ii) Axis, within
12 months after the date of such termination, enters into a letter of intent,
agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with
respect to, or publicly announces, a Business Combination or consummates a
Business Combination, then Axis will, prior to the earlier of the
consummation of a Business Combination or execution of a definitive agreement
with respect thereto, also pay to PRE or its designee, in cash by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by PRE, the
Termination Fee _less_ the No Approval Fee.

(f) If this Agreement is terminated by PRE for any reason pursuant to

or disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal in respect of Axis or the intention
by any Person to make such an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within 12 months

7.1(c)_, Axis enters into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or
publicly announces, a Business Combination or consummates a Business
Combination, then Axis will, upon the earlier to occur of the entering into
such letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement and the consummation of such Business Combination, pay to
PRE or its designee, in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to an account designated by PRE, the Termination Fee.

 



56 (g) If this Agreement is terminated by Axis for any reason pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ (i) following the public announcement
or disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal in respect of PRE or the intention by

after the date of such termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section
7.1(c)_, PRE enters into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or publicly
announces, a Business Combination or consummates a Business Combination, then
PRE will, upon the earlier to occur of the entering into such letter of
intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement and the consummation of such Business Combination, pay to Axis or
its designee, in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Axis, the Termination Fee.

 

(h) For the purposes of this _Section 7.2_, " _Business Combination_ " means:
(i) a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or
similar transaction involving Axis, in the case of Axis, or PRE in the case of
PRE, as a result of which the shareholders of Axis or the shareholders of

more than 50% of the voting securities of the entity surviving or resulting

an equity interest (including by means of a tender or exchange offer)
representing an amount equal to or greater than a 50% voting or economic

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or PRE and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

(i) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall a party be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the event
the Termination Fee is paid to a party in accordance with this _Section 7.2_,
such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its
Subsidiaries, shareholders and Representatives against the other party or any
of its Subsidiaries, shareholders and Representatives with respect to the
termination, event or breach giving rise to that payment, except in the case
of fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

 

(j) Upon any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the
Termination Fee or the No Approval Fee is payable, the party liable to pay
the Termination Fee shall, in addition to payment of the Termination Fee
reimburse the other party and its Affiliates (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds), no later than three Business Days after such termination,
for 100% of their out-of-pocket fees, costs, obligations owed to third
parties and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel)
actually incurred by any of them in contemplation of, in connection with or in
any way relating to the consideration, negotiation or implementation of this
Agreement or the Transactions and other actions contemplated hereby in an
amount not to exceed $35,000,000.

 



57 Axis and PRE each acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the either Axis or PRE (the " _Defaulting Party_ ")
fails promptly to pay any amount due to the other pursuant to this _Section
7.2_, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by the other party in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against Defaulting Party for such amount, together with interest on
the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the rate per annum equal to
the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment
was required to be made, from the date such fee, cost or expense was required
to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

7.3 _Amendment_ _._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after receipt of the Requisite PRE Vote or the Requisite Axis Vote,
but after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires further approval or authorization by the shareholders of PRE or Axis
without such further approval or authorization. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed and delivered
by an authorized representative of each of the parties.

7.4 _Extension; Waiver_ _._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, Axis
(with respect to PRE) and PRE (with respect to Axis) by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent legally
allowed (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of such other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Any agreement by a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. No delay by any party
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right,
nor shall any waiver by any party of any such right nor any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any further exercise of such right or the
exercise of any other such right.

8.3 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Annex
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated to the contrary. The descriptive
Article and Section headings and the table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not intended to be part of
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement unless otherwise 

 



59  defined in such certificate or other document. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its
other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning. Any statute
defined or referred to in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to in this Agreement means such statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable
successor statutes. The parties have participated jointly in the drafting
and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if it is drafted
jointly by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "herewith" and
"hereby" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall be construed non-exclusively.
The phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be construed to be followed by
the phrase "consistent with past practice" regardless of whether such phrase
is expressed. The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and
words of similar import, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth on the
cover page of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the exercise of any
right or the discharge of any duty under this Agreement falls on a day other
than a Business Day, the party having such right or duty shall have until the
next Business Day to exercise such right or discharge such duty. Unless
otherwise indicated, the word "day" shall be interpreted as a calendar day. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by or on behalf of any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. References to "dollars" or
"$" are to United States dollars. Each section or subsection of a Disclosure
Letter qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or
covenant of the Agreement;  _provided_ that information disclosed in one
section or subsection of a Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be included in
each other section or subsection of such Disclosure Letter in which the
relevance of such information would be readily apparent on the face thereof.
Representations and warranties in _Article III_ that are made in reference to
a partys Disclosure Letter or "in the case of" or "with respect to" a certain
party and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates are being made only by that party.
Unless the context shall require otherwise, any Contracts, documents,
instruments or Laws defined or referred to in this Agreement shall be deemed
to mean or refer to such Contracts, documents, instruments or Laws as from
time to time may be amended, modified or supplemented, including (i) in the
case of Contracts, documents or instruments, by waiver or consent and (ii) in
the case of Laws, by succession of comparable successor statutes; provided
that, with respect to Contracts, such rule of construction shall only be
effective with respect to amendments, modification or supplements effected
prior to the date hereof. All references in this Agreement to any particular
Law shall be deemed to refer also to any rules and regulations promulgated
under that Law.

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which
together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The parties may execute
more than one copy of this Agreement, each of which shall constitute an
original. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission,
by electronic mail in "portable document format" ("pdf") form, or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



60 8.5 _Entire Agreement_ _._ This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Annexes
hereto), the Axis Disclosure Letter, the PRE Disclosure Letter, the
Amalgamation Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings or representations by or among the parties whether written and
oral with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
No representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition
not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the
parties to this Agreement. Each party hereby disclaims any other
representation, warranty or inducement, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any other information made by, or made available
by, itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in connection
with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement, the
Amalgamation Agreement or the Transactions.

8.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

8.7 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_ _._ Except for the Indemnified Parties
intended to benefit from the provisions of _Section 5.3_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to create any
third-party beneficiaries or confer upon any Person other than the parties any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
with regard to, in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, the Laws of the State of New York with respect to contracts performed
within that state, provided that any provisions of this Agreement which relate
to the exercise of a director or officers fiduciary duties, statutory
duties, obligations and/or statutory provisions, or which arise under, the
laws of Bermuda (including but not limited to amalgamations under the
Companies Act) shall be governed by and in accordance with the laws of
Bermuda.

8.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally consents, agrees and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Bermuda (and appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any
litigation, action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the subject
matter hereof. Each party agrees to commence any litigation, action, suit or
proceeding relating hereto only in the Supreme Court of Bermuda, or if such
litigation, action, suit or other proceeding may not be brought in such court
for reasons of

 



61  subject matter jurisdiction, in the other appellate courts therefrom or
other courts of Bermuda. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any litigation, action, suit or
proceeding with respect to the subject matter hereof in the Chosen Courts, and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party
further irrevocably and unconditionally consents to and grants any such court
jurisdiction over the Person of such parties and, to the extent
legally effective, over the subject matter of any such dispute and agrees
that mailing of process or other documents in connection with any such action
or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.2_ hereof or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such
litigation, action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached or violated, immediate and
irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy under applicable Law. Accordingly, each party agrees
that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each of
the parties is entitled to a decree of specific performance and shall further
be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of
posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any Legal Action
should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy under applicable Law.

 

8.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations arising under this Agreement shall be directly or indirectly
assigned, delegated sublicensed or transferred by any of the parties (whether
by operation of law or otherwise), in whole or in part, to any other Person
(including any bankruptcy trustee) without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

8.12 _Expenses_ _._ Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.2_, all costs and
expenses (including those payable to Representatives) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions and shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except that those expenses incurred in connection
with filing, printing and mailing the Registration Statement and the Joint
