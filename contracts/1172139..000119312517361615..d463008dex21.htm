(a) _Parent and Parent Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Parent Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the
holders of any securities of Parent or Parent Merger Sub:

 

(i) _Generally_. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Parent
Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(iii)_) shall be converted into the right to receive one (1) share of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable New Parent Common Stock (the "
_Parent Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Parent Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist and each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (" _Parent Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Parent Common
Stock (" _Parent Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, except the right
to receive the Parent Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(ii) _Parent Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of
Parent Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

thereof. The shares of Parent Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall
automatically be converted into such number of shares of common stock of
Parent Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such
Subsidiary in Parent Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _The Company and Rio Grande Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Rio Grande Merger and without any action on the part of any
party or the holders of any securities of the Company or Rio Grande Merger
Sub:

 

(i) _Generally_. All Company LLC Interests issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the aggregate, shall be converted
into the right to receive an aggregate of 100,000,000 validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of New Parent Common Stock (all such shares of
New Parent Common Stock collectively, the " _Rio Grande Merger Consideration_
"). All such Company LLC Interests that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and
each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Company LLC Interest or book-entry
interests which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
LLC Interests shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company LLC Interests or any Company Entity Organizational Document, except
the right to receive the Rio Grande Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(ii) _Rio Grande Merger Sub LLC Interests_. Each limited liability company
interest in Rio Grande Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall continue as a limited liability company interest of
Rio Grande Surviving Company, which shall constitute the only outstanding
limited liability company interests of Rio Grande Surviving Company.

(c) _C_ _er_ _t_ _a_ _in Adjustm_ _e_ _nts_. If, between the Execution
Date and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse
stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar Event shall
have occurred, then the Parent Merger Consideration and the Rio Grande Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ , however, that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party
hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

2.2 _Exchange of Parent Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to or concurrent with the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with a commercial bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of 

 



6  shares of Parent Common Stock book-entry interests (which, to the extent
subsequently requested, shall be exchanged for certificates), representing the
total number of shares of New Parent Common Stock issuable as Parent Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Parent Merger (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. New Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
promptly (and in any event no more than five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, mail to each holder of record of a Parent Certificate (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Parent
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Parent Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Parent Certificates in exchange for the Parent
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock
formerly represented by such Parent Certificates. Upon surrender of a Parent
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and deliver to the holder of such Parent
Certificate the number of whole shares of New Parent Common Stock (in the
form of book-entry interests, unless the holder of such Parent Certificate
expressly requests that such interests be delivered in certificated form) in
respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock formerly represented by such
Parent Certificate, and the Parent Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Parent
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Parent, the
Parent Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Parent
Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Parent Certificate formerly
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence, reasonably satisfactory to New Parent, that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Parent
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Parent Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock formerly represented
by such Parent Certificate and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Promptly (and in any event no more than two (2)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall issue and
deliver to each holder of Parent Book-Entry Shares the number of whole shares
of New Parent Common Stock (in the form of book-entry interests, unless the
holder of such shares of Parent Common Stock expressly requests that such
interests be delivered in certificated form) in respect of such shares of
Parent Common Stock, without such holder being required to deliver a Parent
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Shares of Parent
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect
of New Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Parent Certificate, unless and
until the holder of such Parent Certificate shall surrender such Parent
Certificate. Subject to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Parent Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of whole New Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore

 



7  paid with respect to such whole shares of New Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of New Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) _Further Rights in Parent Common Stock_. The Parent Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of a share of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
share of Parent Common Stock (other than the right to receive dividends
or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_).

(e) _Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by former stockholders of Parent entitled thereto one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Effective Time shall be returned to New Parent and such
former stockholders shall thereafter look only to New Parent for payment of
the Parent Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by such former stockholders
five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become the property of New Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Neither New Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Parent Common Stock for the Parent
Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable Law.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Parent Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Parent Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by New Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as New Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Parent Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Parent
Certificate the Parent Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Parent Common Stock formerly represented by such Parent Certificate and
any dividend or other distribution to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, in each case without any interest
thereon.

 

(h) _Withholding_. New Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
local, state, federal, or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld by New Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by New Parent or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be.

2.3 _ Issuance of Merger Consideration_. At the Closing, New Parent shall
deliver to Holdings the Rio Grande Merger Consideration, in book-entry form,
together with an executed

 



8  certificate of the transfer agent of New Parent Common Stock certifying as
to the book-entry issuance thereof or, if requested by Holdings, certificates
of the New Parent Common Stock representing the Rio Grande Merger
Consideration bearing customary legends noting that such securities constitute
restricted securities under the Securities Act; _provided, however_ , that in
the event any Company LLC Interests are certificated, New Parent shall have
no obligation to deliver the Rio Grande Merger Consideration to Holdings until
Holdings delivers the certificates representing its Company LLC Interests to
New Parent. No certificates or scrip representing fractional interests in New
Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same will be issued.

2.4 _Stock/LLC Interest Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
applicable transfer books of Parent and the Company shall be closed with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and Company LLC Interests and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Parent Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of Parent or of
transfers of Company LLC Interests on the records of the Company.

 

2.5 _ Parent Equity Awards_.

Parent Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
in respect of that number of whole shares of New Parent Common Stock equal to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Restricted
Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Parent Performance Unit Awards_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
award of performance units in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock (a "
_Parent Performance Unit Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior

Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Transactions.

the Securities Act.

in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (b)

by them), beneficially or of record with any applicable Governmental Entity
that (1) collectively entitles Parent Entities to receive (after satisfaction
of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced
from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas
Properties (other than decreases in connection with operations in which Parent
Entities may be a non-consenting co-owner, decreases resulting from reversion
of interests to co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners
elected not to consent, decreases resulting from the establishment of pools or
units, and decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make
up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries), (2)
obligates Parent Entities to collectively bear a percentage of the costs and
expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to,
such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on
the Parent Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than
increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting
or non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or Laws and
increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in the
net revenue interest of Parent Entities) and (3) is free and clear of all

(ii) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied by or on behalf of the
Parent Entities to the Parent Reserve Engineer relating to the Parent
Entities interests referred to in the Parent Reserve Reports and that was
material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable
to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Parent Entities in connection with the
preparation of the Parent Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided (or as
modified or amended prior to the issuance of the Parent Reserve Reports),
accurate in all material respects. To Parents Knowledge, any assumptions or
estimates provided by the Parent Entities to the Parent Reserve Engineer in
connection with their preparation of the Parent Reserve Reports were made in
good faith and on a reasonable basis based on the facts and circumstances in
existence and that were to known to Parent at the time such assumptions or
estimates were made. The estimates of proved oil and gas reserves provided by
the Parent Entities to the Parent Reserve Engineer in connection with the
preparation of the Parent Reserve Reports complied in all material respects
with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. Parents internal
proved reserve estimates prepared by management for the year ended December
31, 2016 were not, taken as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in
such Parent Reserve Reports. Except for changes generally affecting the oil
and gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no
material change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve
Reports that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material

Properties (to the extent operated by Parent or any Parent Entity) are being
held in suspense (by Parent, any Parent Entity, any third-party operator
thereof or any other Person or individual) for any reason other than awaiting
preparation and approval of division order title opinions for recently drilled
wells. Section 3.9(b)(iii)(C) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth all

that are scheduled to expire (in whole or in part) at any time in the twelve
(12)-month period immediately following the Execution Date.

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no Parent
Entity (and, to Parents Knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any

notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to
cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by any Parent Entity and no Parent Entity (or, to
Parents Knowledge, any third party operator) has received written notice from
any other party to any such Oil and Gas Lease (1) that any Parent Entity (or

completed in a manner that is not within the limits permitted by all
applicable Laws, Oil and Gas Leases or other instruments governing the Oil and
Gas Properties. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no
Parent Entity has elected not to participate in any operation or activity
proposed with respect to any of the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by it
(or them, as applicable)

Permitted Encumbrances), sufficient to allow it to conduct the Business as
currently being conducted.

 

(b) _Oil and Gas Properties_.

 

(i) Except for (A) property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business since the dates of the reserve reports prepared by
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (" _Company Reserve Engineer_ ")
relating to the Company Entity interests referred to therein as of December
31, 2016 (the " _Company Reserve Reports_ "), (B) property reflected in the
Company Reserve Reports as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of
the Execution Date or (C) matters that would not reasonably be expected to

Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve
Reports and in each case as attributable to interests owned by the Company
Entities, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible
title" means the collective title of Company Entities (as of the date

owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them), beneficially or of
record with any applicable Governmental Entity that (1) collectively entitles
Company Entities to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens
applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the
Company Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas
Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties (other than
decreases in connection with operations in which Company Entities may be a
non-consenting co-owner, decreases resulting from reversion of interests to
co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners elected not to
consent, decreases resulting from the establishment of pools or units,
and decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries), (2) obligates
Company Entities to collectively bear a percentage of the costs and expenses
for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil
and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the
Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than increases

31  defaulting or non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating agreements
or Laws and increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate
increase in the net revenue interest of Company Entities) and (3) is free and
clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company Entities in connection with the
preparation of the Company Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided (or as
modified or amended prior to the issuance of the Company Reserve Reports),
accurate in all material respects. To the Companys Knowledge, any
assumptions or estimates provided by the Company Entities to the Company
Reserve Engineer in connection with their preparation of the Company Reserve
Reports were made in good faith and on a reasonable basis based on the facts
and circumstances in existence and that were to known to the Company at the
time such assumptions or estimates were made. The estimates of proved oil and
gas reserves provided by the Company Entities to the Company Reserve Engineer

for the year ended December 31, 2016 were not, taken as a whole, materially
lower than the conclusions in such Company Reserve Reports. Except for
changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and

depletion by production, there has been no material change in respect of the
matters addressed in the Company Reserve Reports that would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

for any reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order
title opinions for recently drilled wells. Section 4.9(b)(iii) of the Company

such Parent Alternative Proposal, request, inquiry or proposal or any
Representative of such Person.

 

(d) Parent, directly or indirectly through one or more of its
Representatives, may:

 

(i) prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, engage in the
activities prohibited by  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)(_ _i_ _)_ or _6.1(a)(ii)_
solely with and to any Person who has made a bona fide written Parent
Alternative Proposal after the Execution Date that did not result from, or was
otherwise knowingly facilitated by, a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_;
_provided,_ _however_ , that (A) no non-public information may be furnished to
such Person until Parent receives an executed confidentiality agreement from
such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent that are no
less favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, further, that such confidentiality
agreement may not contain provisions that prohibit Parent from complying with
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and Parent provides the
Company (x) as promptly as practicable and prior to providing any nonpublic
information, a copy of such executed confidentiality agreement and (y)
substantially concurrently with providing it to any such other Person, any
non-public information (or access with respect thereto) to Parent and its
Subsidiaries furnished to such other Person which was not previously furnished
to the Company and (B) prior to taking any such actions, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
legal counsel, that (1) such Parent Alternative Proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal and (2) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response
to a bona fide written Parent Alternative Proposal received by Parent after
the Execution Date that did not result from, or was otherwise facilitated by,
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, the Parent Board may effect a Parent
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(f)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Parent Superior Proposal, if prior to taking such action the Parent Board
reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel that (A) such Parent Alternative Proposal
is a Parent Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
__provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that prior to effecting such Parent Change in
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, (A) Parent shall have given at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice to the Company that Parent has received such proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal (including a
copy of the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
Parent Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and any other material
documents (including financing commitments, if any) and correspondence in
respect thereof, including the identity of the Person making such

 



51  proposal), and, that Parent intends to take such action at the end of the
notice period, which notice shall specify the basis for such Parent
Recommendation Change (such notice being referred to herein as a " _Parent SP
Recommendation Change Notice_ "), (B) during the five (5) Business Day period
starting after the date on which such notice is received, if requested by the
Company, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to negotiate in good faith with the Company and the Companys
Representatives (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate), which may be
on a non-exclusive basis with respect to other negotiations or discussions
permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, to revise the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that it would cause the Parent Alternative Proposal to no
longer be a Parent Superior Proposal, and (C) following such five (5)
Business Day period, the Parent Board after taking into account in good faith
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by the
Company and, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Parent Alternative
Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; each time material modifications to the terms of a Parent
Alternative Proposal determined to be a Parent Superior Proposal are made a
new Parent SP Recommendation Change Notice shall be required, and in such
case, the time periods set forth in the foregoing _clauses (B)_ and (C) with
respect to the new notice shall be three (3) Business Days; and __

 

(iii) prior to the obtaining of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent
Board may make a Parent Recommendation Change of the type described in clause
(i) or (ii) of the definition thereof in response to a Parent Intervening
Event if prior to taking such action the Parent Board reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Parent Board to make such Parent
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that prior to effecting
such Parent Recommendation Change (A) Parent shall have given the Company at
least five (5) Business Days prior written notice informing the Company that
Parent has determined that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred or arisen
(which notice will reasonably describe such Parent Intervening Event) and
Parent intends to effect a Parent Recommendation Change at the end of the
notice period (such notice being referred to herein as a "
_Parent Recommendation Change Notice_ "), (B) during the five (5) Business
Day period starting after the date on which such Parent Recommendation Change
Notice is received, if requested by the Company, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with the
Company and the Companys Representatives (to the extent the Company wishes to
negotiate), which may be on a non-exclusive basis with respect to other
negotiations or discussions permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, to revise
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that a failure of the Parent
Board to effect such a Parent Recommendation Change in response to such
Parent Intervening Event would not be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (C) following such five (5)
Business Day period after the date of the Parent Recommendation
Change Notice, the Parent Board after taking into account in good faith any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company and, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have
reasonably determined in good faith that the failure to effect such a Parent
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 



52 (e) No Parent Recommendation Change shall change the approval of
this Agreement for purposes of DGCL, and in no event shall Parent or Parent
Board be permitted to rescind or amend the resolutions approving this
Agreement as in effect on the Execution Date.

 

6.2 _Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date, Parent and
New Parent, as applicable, shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC,
(i) a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in order to seek the Parent Stockholder
Approval and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4, to register the
issuance of the New Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Parent
Merger as Parent Merger Consideration (together with all amendments thereto,
the " _Registration Statement_ "), and in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Parent shall cause the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. The Company shall
(i) cooperate with Parent in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement; (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish the
information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to provide
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Parents
outside legal counsel in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. Each of
Parent and New Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective, including the execution of any
required undertaking to file post-effective amendments, and the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as is practicable after filing and
keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the Transactions, and each of Parent and New Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
holders of Parent Common Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Registration Statement shall have been declared effective and the Proxy
Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC. Each party shall also take any
action required to be taken and make any necessary filings under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the Transactions, this Agreement or the issuance of New Parent
Common Stock in the Transactions. All filings by the Company or Parent
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions and all mailings to the
stockholders of Parent in connection with the Transactions shall be subject to
the reasonable opportunity for prior review and comment by the other party,
which comments the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall consider in good
faith, acting reasonably.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
to use reasonable best efforts so that none of the information supplied or to
be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading and (ii) the Proxy

 



53  Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders and at the time of the Parent Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statement was made,
not misleading.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any party discovers any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement so that
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and
Parent shall promptly cause to be filed with the SEC an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminate such information to the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under
_Sections 6.2(a),_ _6.2(b)_ and _6.2(d)_.

 

(d) The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
correspondence, communications or comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with (i) copies of all
correspondence and a description of all material oral discussions between it
or any of its respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement,
the Registration Statement or the Transactions and (ii) copies of all orders
of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

 

6.3 _ Stockholders Meeting; Recommendations_. Parent shall take, in
accordance with the DGCL and its Organizational Documents, all actions
reasonably necessary to mail the Proxy Statement to Parents stockholders and
to establish a record date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholder Meeting_ ") as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
for the purpose of securing the Parent Stockholder Approval. Unless a Parent
Recommendation Change is effected in accordance with  _Section 6.1_ , the
Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Parent Board has unanimously (A)
approved this Agreement and the Transactions; (B) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of
Parent and its stockholders; and (C) include the Parent Recommendation; and
(ii) subject to the consent of the Parent Financial Advisor, which consent has
been obtained, include the Parent Fairness Opinion. Unless a Parent
Recommendation Change is effected in accordance with _Section 6.1_ , Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of Parent
votes in favor of the Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Parent
Recommendation Change, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders
of Parent at the Parent Stockholder Meeting and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation unless this Agreement has been
validly terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Parent
Alternative Proposal or other acquisition proposal other than the
Transactions. Anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
notwithstanding, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholder
Meeting (i) to the

 



54  extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement that Parent has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law is provided to
Parents stockholders, (ii) if, as of the time for which the meeting of
Parents stockholders is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such meeting or (iii) with the consent of the Company, to solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval;
_provided,_ _however_ , that no adjournment may be to a date on or after three
(3) Business Days prior to the End Date.

 

6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, Parent will provide and will cause Parents
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors, agents
and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to provide the
Company and its authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, such reasonable access to the offices,
employees, customers, suppliers, properties, books and records of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries) as the Company may reasonably
request (including for the purposes of conducting environmental due
diligence). Subject to applicable Law, the Company will provide and
will cause the Companys Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to provide Parent and its authorized Representatives, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such reasonable
access to the offices, employees, properties, books and records of the
Company Entities (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of any Company Entities) as Parent may reasonably request
(including for the purposes of planning the operation of New Parent after the
Effective Time and conducting environmental due diligence). No party shall
have access to personnel records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories
or other information that in such other partys good faith opinion the
disclosure of which could subject such other party or any of its Subsidiaries
to risk of liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no party shall be permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of any
environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other party
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of such other party,
which may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion.

(b) With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 6.4_ each of the Company and Parent shall comply with, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to comply with,
all of its obligations under the mutual nondisclosure and confidentiality
agreement, dated October 9, 2017, previously executed by the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No party shall be required to
provide access to or disclose any information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such party or any Subsidiary
of such party or contravene any Contract, Law or order (it being agreed that
the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such
jeopardy or contravention).

 



55 6.5 _Efforts to Consummate; Notification_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Holdings and the Parent Parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to

best efforts to, (i) cause the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_

approvals, permits, orders or authorizations (including the expiration or
termination of any waiting periods) from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and take all steps as may be necessary to avoid, or to have terminated, if
begun, any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity by the End Date, (iii) obtain
all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations
from third parties, (iv) defend any investigations or Proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, including seeking to avoid the entry of, or to have
reversed, terminated, lifted or vacated, any stay, temporary restraining order
or other injunctive relief or order entered by any Governmental Entity that
could prevent or delay the Transactions or the consummation of the
Transactions and (v) execute and deliver additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent,
Holdings, the Fund and the Company shall (i) if at any time the parties
determine that a filing is required under the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions by a party or any of its Affiliates, such party shall make or
cause to be made any such filings as promptly reasonably as
practicable thereafter, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after such determination, (ii) furnish to any other party as promptly as
reasonably practicable all information required for any application or other
filing to be made by the other party pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information or documentation that may
be requested by, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the
" _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or by any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such registrations, declarations and
filings or such transactions, (iv) promptly notify the other party of any
communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the
application of a Regulatory Law to any of the Transactions, (v) discuss with
and permit the other party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the other partys reasonable comments in connection
with, any proposed filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party
to any other Person, relating to any Regulatory Law or any investigation or
other Proceeding pursuant to any Regulatory Law in connection with the
Transactions, (vi) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting,
telephone call or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry relating to any
Regulatory Law or any investigation or other Proceeding pursuant to any
Regulatory Law in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by

 



56  such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, (vii) furnish
the other party promptly with copies of all correspondence and communications
relating to any Regulatory Law or any investigation or other Proceeding
pursuant to any Regulatory Law between them and their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, and (viii) act in good
faith and use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other party
in connection with any such registrations, declarations and filings and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such
agency or other Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory
Law with respect to any such registration, declaration and filing or any such
transaction. Anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_
notwithstanding, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel
may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent and
its Subsidiaries or the Company Entities or as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Holdings, the Fund and Parent agree not to extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not
to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. From and after the
Execution Date, the parties shall convene once every seven (7) days to
undertake an assessment of whether any filings are required of any party under
the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions (a " _Filing Determination_ ");
_provided_ , _that_ , once the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting is set
by Parent, the parties shall no longer be required to convene for a Filing
Determination so long as the date of the then-most-recent Filing
Determination is within fifty (50) days of the date of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall
require, or be construed to require, the Fund, Holdings or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to agree
to (i) sell, divest, discontinue, hold separate or limit any assets,
businesses or interests, (ii) terminate, modify, or create any ventures,
(iii) terminate or modify any existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations, (iv) effectuate any other changes or restructurings, (v) create
any contractual rights or obligations or firewalls, (vi) refrain from making
any investment or acquisition, or (vii) any conditions relating to, or changes
or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or
interests; provided, that this Section 6.5(c) does not apply to the Company
or its Subsidiaries.

6.6 _Certain Notices_. The Company and Parent shall each promptly advise
the other party of (a) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions or (b) upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent or approval is required
for consummation of the Transactions that causes such party to believe that
there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or approval will be
materially delayed.

6.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a release mutually agreed upon by
the Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall consult with
each other and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statements with

 



57  respect to the Transactions or this Agreement and shall not issue any such
other press release prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares
of either party on any securities exchange, in which case the party proposing
to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party and
provide the other party with an opportunity to review and comment on the
content of the proposed disclosure, which comments such party shall consider
in good faith, acting reasonable, before issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement; _provided, however_ , that (i) each of
the Company and Parent may make press releases or public announcements
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions that consist solely of
information previously disclosed in previous press releases or announcements
made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
and (ii) Parent may make any public statements in response to questions by the
press, analysts, investors or analysts or those participating in investor
calls or industry conferences, so long as such statements consist solely of
information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent and/or the Company in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

6.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, New Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each), in the same manner as
provided by the Company and Parent, as applicable, immediately prior to the
Execution Date, each present and former director, officer and employee of the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries (in all of their
capacities (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")), against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including with respect to acts or omissions by directors or officers of
Parent or its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such arising in connection
with the Transactions), and shall provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties, in all such cases to the same extent that such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the Execution Date by the Company pursuant to the Companys Organizational
Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, or by any one of the
Companys Subsidiaries pursuant to such Subsidiarys Organizational Documents
and indemnification agreements of any Subsidiary of the Company, if any, in
existence on the Execution Date.

(b) New Parent agrees that, until the six (6) year anniversary date of the
Effective Time, New Parents Organizational Documents shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification of the current and former
directors and officers of the Company or of Parent than are provided in the
New Parent Certificate and the New Parent Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of
the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or unless such
amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law.

 



58 (c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, New Parent shall maintain
in effect for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties an insurance and
indemnification policy with an insurer with the same or better credit rating
as the current carrier for Parent that provides coverage for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person covered by
the officers and directors liability insurance policy of the Company on
terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable in the
aggregate than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect on the Execution Date; _provided, however_ , that New Parent
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by Parent for such coverage; and
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if any annual premium for such
insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual premium, New Parent shall
obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding
such amount. New Parents obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ may
be satisfied by New Parent, or, with the approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) of the Company, Parent, purchasing a "tail" policy
from an insurer with substantially the same or better credit rating as the
current carrier for the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, (ii) covers each person covered by the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy in effect on the Execution Date or at the Effective
Time for actions and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, and
(iii) contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those of
the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the
Execution Date. If such "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, New Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder
to be honored by New Parent.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8,_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. New Parent shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to such indemnity.

 

(e) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, if New Parent,
or any of its successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of New
Parent honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.8_.

 

6.9 Employee Matters.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, New Parent
shall or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to provide employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who are employed as of the Effective Time and who
continue in the employ of New Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing Date ( the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with the following for so long
as they remain so employed compensation and benefits that are commensurate
with the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent.

 



59 (b) From and after the Closing, New Parent shall give each
Continuing Employee full credit for all purposes under any employee benefit
plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by New Parent or any of its
Affiliates for such Continuing Employees service with any Company Entity and
with any predecessor employer to the same extent recognized prior to the
Closing under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ that the
foregoing service recognition shall not apply (i) to the extent such credit
would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service,
(ii) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree welfare plan, or (iii) for purposes of any benefit plan that is frozen
or provides grandfathered benefits.

 

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, if Parent advises the
Company in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
that Parent desires to take assignment of any agreement on Section 6.9(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (which agreements constitute the only Company
Benefit Plans providing for any actual or contingent severance liability,
other than the New Severance Arrangements (as defined below)), Holdings shall
take all actions necessary to assign to the Company such agreement prior to
the Effective Time, such that the Company shall be able to enforce the
restrictive covenants thereunder (it being understood that such assignment
shall in no manner result in the Company assuming any obligations in respect
of Holdings incentive programs or in respect of any compensatory
arrangements other than the potential severance payments referenced in such
agreements). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled to adopt severance arrangements for employees of the
Company that provide for potential severance obligations of the Company to
such employees (the " _New Severance Arrangements_ "), provided that in no
event shall the potential costs (including payroll Taxes) of the New Severance
Arrangements exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate.

(d) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any employee
benefit plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any Person. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee (or spouse or dependent thereof) of Parent, New Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than the parties hereto and
their respective permitted successors and assigns), any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall give any employee or other service
provider of Parent, New Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Person any right to continued employment or service.

6.10  _ Section 16(b) Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause any disposition of equity
securities of Parent (including derivative securities with respect there) or
acquisition of equity securities of New Parent (including derivative
securities with respect thereto) resulting from the Transactions by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act 

 



60 with respect to Parent or who will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to New Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in no-
action letters issued by the SEC in similar transactions.

 

6.11 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Laws or any anti-takeover provision
or restriction on ownership in the Organizational Documents of Parent is or
may become applicable to the Transactions, Parent and the Parent Board shall
grant such approvals and take all such actions as are necessary or advisable
so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute, regulation or provision in Parents
Organizational Documents on such transactions.

 

6.12 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the New Parent Common Stock to be issued to Holdings and Parent
stockholders pursuant to the Mergers to be approved for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.13 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, New Parent, the Company and Holdings (i) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to together qualify, and shall
not take or knowingly fail to take (and shall cause any Subsidiaries and
Affiliates of such party not to take or knowingly fail to take) any action
that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers from
together qualifying, as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code and
(ii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Merger to
qualify, and shall not take or knowingly fail to take (and shall cause
any Subsidiaries or Affiliates of such party not to take or knowingly fail to
take) any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Parent Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Each of Parent, the Company and Holdings shall use its reasonable
best efforts and shall cooperate with one another to obtain the opinions of
counsel referred to in _Sections 7.2(d)_ and _7.3(d)_. Such opinions shall be
based, in part, on (i) a duly executed certificate substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C1 (the " _Company Tax Certificate_ "), (ii) a
duly executed certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C2 (the " _Holdings Tax Certificate_ "), (iii) a duly executed
certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C3 (the "
_Parent 351 Tax Certificate_ "), (iv) a duly executed certificate
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C4 (the " _Parent 368
Tax Certificate_ "), and (v) a duly executed certificate substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C5 (the " _New_ _Parent 368 Tax Certificate_
"), in each case, dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as
of the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC). Parent, New Parent, the Company and Holdings shall provide such other
information as reasonably requested by each of Company Tax Counsel and Parent
Tax Counsel for purposes of rendering the opinions described in _Sections
7.2(d)_ and _7.3(d)_ , as applicable. The Company (x) represents that it has
been advised by Company Tax Counsel that, absent a relevant change in law
prior to the Closing, the forms of tax certificates attached hereto as
Exhibit C1, Exhibit C2, and Exhibit C3, if duly executed and delivered to
Company Tax Counsel immediately prior to the Closing,

 



61  would be sufficient to enable Company Tax Counsel to deliver the opinion
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and (y) acknowledges and agrees that
nothing contained in such forms of tax certificates, if duly executed and
delivered to Company Tax Counsel immediately prior to the Closing, would cause
the opinion referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ to fail to be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. Parent (x) represents that it has been advised
by Parent Tax Counsel that, absent a relevant change in law prior to the
Closing, the forms of tax certificates attached hereto as Exhibit C1, Exhibit
C2, Exhibit C3, Exhibit C4 and Exhibit C5, if duly executed and delivered to
Parent Tax Counsel immediately prior to the Closing, would be sufficient to
enable Parent Tax Counsel to deliver the opinion referred to in _Section_ __ _
7.3(d)_ and (y) acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in such forms
of tax certificates, if duly executed and delivered to Parent Tax Counsel
immediately prior to the Closing, would cause the opinion referred to in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_ to fail to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(c) At Closing, Holdings shall deliver to Parent a certification of non-
foreign status duly executed by Holdings substantially in the form of the
applicable sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv), to the effect that Holdings is not a foreign person.

 

6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts
to provide to Parent all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with (x) any equity capital markets financing of Parent, and/or
(y) in connection with any amendments to, or consent solicitations or
exchange offers with respect to, Parents or the Companys existing
Indebtedness (any such transaction described in clause (x) or (y), a "
_Financing_ "); __provided__ _, _ _ _however__ , that anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14_ to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) in no event shall
the "reasonable best efforts" of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Company
Representatives be deemed or construed to require such Persons to, and such
Persons shall not be required, to provide such cooperation to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (2) neither the Companys board of
directors nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries boards of directors (or
equivalent bodies) shall be required to approve or adopt any Financing or
agreements related thereto (or any alternative financing) prior to the
Effective Time, and (3) neither the Company nor any of the Companys
Subsidiaries shall be required to execute or deliver any agreements,
certificates or instruments in connection with any Financing (or any
alternative financing) (other than customary representation letters and
authorization letters) that is not contingent on the Effective Time.

 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Companys
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm,
disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the

 



62  Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Financing (including any action taken
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information provided in writing by
the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
therewith), in each case, except to the extent any of the foregoing was
suffered or incurred as a result of bad faith, gross negligence, willful
misconduct or material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ by the Company,
any of the Companys Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives.

 

6.15 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, after the receipt of a request from Parent
to do so, deliver lien terminations and instruments of discharge (including a
customary payoff letter) with respect to the Existing Company Credit Agreement
to be delivered at the Closing and give any other notices requested by Parent
in order to facilitate repayment of the Existing Company Credit Agreement. In
addition, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to assist Parent, at
Parents request, in facilitating the termination, amendment, or assumption
of any Derivative Transactions of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

 

6.16 _ Stockholder Litigation_ _._ Each party shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other Transactions that is brought against such party, its
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors and shall keep the other
party informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status
thereof. Parent shall give (i) the Company the opportunity to participate, at
its expense and subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in the defense
or settlement of any such litigation, (ii) afford the Company a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on filings and responses related thereto,
which comments Parent shall consider and implement in good faith, acting
reasonably and (iii) keep the Company apprised of, and consult with
the Company with respect to, proposed strategy and any significant decisions
related thereto, and Parent shall not settle or offer to settle any such
litigation without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.17 _Parent Covenants._ Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to perform and comply with its obligations under, to enforce its rights
under, and to consummate or complete the transactions and matters contemplated
by the Section 6.17 Agreements.

83 11.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

11.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and

with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

11.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior

of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereunder, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other of any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

11.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is

following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the
period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. References
to any period of days will be deemed to be to the relevant number of calendar
days unless otherwise specified.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES

capitalized

 



86  terms used but not defined therein shall have the meanings assigned to them
in this Agreement; (b) the section numbers correspond to the section numbers

the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Each party agrees that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
provisions contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether

__ _ 8.4_) to seek and obtain a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such provisions, and an injunction

no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,

11.12 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a written instrument executed and delivered
by all the parties whether before or after approval of the Mergers or the
other Transactions; _provided, however_ , that, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made for which applicable Law or the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by stockholders or members without
such further approval.

been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that

party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not
be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Therefore,
the parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



87 11.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges that

virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that
no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise
be incurred by any of the Related Parties, as such, for any obligation or
liability of any Party under this Agreement or any documents or instruments
