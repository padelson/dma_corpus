AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February 25, 2008, is by and among SXC Health Solutions Corp. (" _Parent_ "), a corporation organized under the laws of Yukon Territory, Canada, SXC Health Solutions, Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _US Corp._ "), Comet Merger Corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), a newly-formed Delaware corporation that is wholly-owned by US Corp. and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and National Medical Health Card Systems, Inc. (the " _Company_ "), a Delaware corporation. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_ ") has determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company that the Company be acquired by Parent; 

  

 WHEREAS, Merger Sub has agreed to commence an exchange offer (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), in which Offer each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn would be exchanged for (a) $7.70 in cash, without interest and (b) such amount of a fully paid and non assessable common share of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (such amount of cash and Parent Common Stock, or any higher amount per share offered in Merger Subs sole and absolute discretion pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.1(i) or 1.1(j), the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub and the Company shall consummate a merger pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Second Step_ _Merger_ "), and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Second Step Merger, and each share of Company Common Stock that is not validly tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties have agreed that upon certain conditions, Merger Sub would terminate the Offer and the parties would instead seek to consummate the acquisition of the Company by Parent by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _One Step Merger_ ", the One Step Merger or the Second Step Merger are each sometimes referred to as the " _Merger_ ") whereby each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock as of the effective time of the One Step Merger would be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, following adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company, and has adopted and approved, and declared it advisable for the Company to enter into, this Agreement with Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub providing for the Offer, the Second Step Merger and the One Step Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (b) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer and adopt this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub have each adopted and approved and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, and simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, each of New Mountain Partners, L.P. and New Mountain Affiliated Investors, L.P. (each, a " _Stockholder Party_ ") is entering into an agreement in the form of Annex C (each, a " _Stockholder Agreement_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective covenants, agreements, representations and warranties herein contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1. _The Offer._  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_  

   

 (a) Provided that the Company shall have complied with its applicable obligations under Section 1.2 (other than clause (e)), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Merger Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer at the Offer Price no later than March 24, 2008 (and in any event as promptly as practicable after the date hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may consummate the Offer through Merger Sub, its indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary. 

   

 (b) The obligation of Merger Sub (and Parents obligation to cause Merger Sub) to accept for exchange, and exchange the Offer Price for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer (other than shares of Company Common Stock tendered by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred), prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, together with any shares of Company Common Stock then directly or indirectly owned by Merger Sub, represents more than 9,600,000 shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex B (the Minimum Condition and such other conditions collectively referred to herein as the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right in their sole and absolute discretion to waive any of the Offer Conditions and to modify the terms of the Offer; provided, that unless previously approved in writing by the Company in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, (i) the Minimum Condition may not be amended nor may it be waived if such waiver would result in Merger Sub purchasing less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (for purposes of this clause (i) treating each share of the Companys Series A 7% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _Company Convertible Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Stock_ "), as having been converted into a share of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designations), (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer or reduces the ratio of cash to Parent Common Stock, decreases the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, amends or adds to the Offer Conditions, or otherwise modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the stockholders of the Company, and (iii) except as set forth in Section 1.1(c), the Offer may not be extended nor may any change be made to the Offer that would require an extension of or delay in the then current expiration date of the Offer. Holders of shares of Company Common Stock will not be able to tender such shares by guaranteed delivery unless Merger Sub otherwise elects in its sole and absolute discretion to permit guaranteed delivery. For purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been met, the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Convertible Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn if the Tender 

   ##### 

  

   

Documents referred to in Section 2.1 of each of the Stockholder Agreements are
delivered to the depositary for the Offer in accordance with such Section 2.1
and not withdrawn. 

   

 (c) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the twenty-first (21st) business day (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial Offer Period_ "). Subject to the provisions of Section 1.5, and subject to the parties respective termination rights under Section 9 (if applicable), (i) if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any Offer Condition has not been satisfied in Parents reasonable discretion or waived (if such waiver is permitted hereunder), Merger Sub shall extend the Offer until the earlier to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver of all of the Offer Conditions and (y) the End Date, and (ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or the Nasdaq Market (including any successor exchange, " _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable Law. Following the expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may elect to provide one or more subsequent offering periods (each, a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act and in compliance with all other provisions of applicable Law. Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall as promptly as practicable following expiration of the Offer accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock (A) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and/or (B) validly tendered in any such Subsequent Offering Period. The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes. 

   

 (d) Subject to the foregoing and applicable Law and upon the terms of and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for payment, as promptly as permitted under applicable securities Law, and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), as promptly as practicable after the date on which Merger Sub first accepts shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer (the date and time of such first acceptance, regardless of whether Parent and Merger Sub elect to provide for one or more Subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, the " _Acceptance Date_ "), all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (e) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would have been received by such stockholder) shall, upon surrender of his or her Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (each as defined below), be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq on the Acceptance Date by (ii) the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 

   

 (f) The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC (i) a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") that shall contain the Preliminary Prospectus, an offer to exchange, a form of related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement in respect of the Offer (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the Registration Statement and such other ancillary documents as may be required, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) a registration statement on Form F-4 (or Form S-4) to register the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger (the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement will include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) of the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_ "). Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company, its directors, officers and affiliates as may be required by applicable securities Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement or the other Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the other Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with applicable securities laws and to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer and the Merger. Following the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, Parent shall file the final prospectus included therein under Rule 424(b) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the other Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Registration Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the other Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement or the other Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments or other communications, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). 

   

 (h) Parent and/or US Corp. shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds and shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (i) If, between the date hereof and the date on which any share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Stock are changed (or a record date for such change occurs) into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for such transaction. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (j) If, between the date hereof and the date on which any share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed (or a record date for such change occurs) into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for such transaction. 

   

 (k) Subject to Section 1.5, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, except that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto.

steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with (i) any comments

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, so long as Parent has timely provided to the Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or its stockholders (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates), officers, directors or employees, or of any right of the Company under this Agreement, any amendment of the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any amendment or change to or any other consent or action by the Company Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or in connection herewith shall only be effected if there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or by the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director). The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, to purchase that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1) share of Company Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the filing of the 

   ##### 

  

   

certificate of ownership and merger to effect the Second Step Merger (giving
effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares), at a price per share
equal to $11.00. 

   

 (b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any time on or following the Acceptance Date and prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the later of (i) the Acceptance Date or (ii) the expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Merger Sub agrees that it will exercise the Top Up Option if doing so would allow it to consummate the Merger pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL. The obligation of Merger Sub to exercise the Top Up Option and of the Company to deliver the Top Up Option Shares on the exercise of the Top Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) immediately prior to the filing of the certificate of ownership and merger to effect the Second Step Merger, the aggregate number of shares owned directly or indirectly by Merger Sub will constitute one (1) share of Company Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at such time (giving effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares) and (ii) the number of Top Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top Up Option does not exceed the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then authorized and unissued or held as treasury shares by the Company. 

   

 (c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top Up Option, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (the " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ "): (i) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that will be owned by Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares (provided the Company has provided Merger Sub with the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the applicable date), and (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, which may be the same day as, but shall not be more than five (5) business days after, delivery of such notice (the " _Top Up Closing_ "). At the Top Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares (calculated by multiplying the number of such Top Up Option Shares by $11.00) by wire transfer of same day funds to a bank designated by the Company in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the Top Up Option Shares and a promissory note, bearing interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum, for the balance of the purchase price, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing such Top Up Option Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top Up Option Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger Sub agrees that the Top Up Option and the Top Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 (e) Upon the delivery by Merger Sub to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in Section 1.4(c), Merger Sub shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed or refused to designate the bank account described in Section 1.4(c). 

   

 Section 1.5 _Change in Structure Event_. At the earlier to occur of (a) the parties so agreeing in writing or (b) unless a Change in Recommendation shall have occurred, the date ten (10) business days after the expiration of the Initial Offer Period (or such later date as the parties agree in writing) if the Minimum Condition or the Short Form Condition is not then satisfied (a " _Change in Structure Event_ "), (i) Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following such Change in Structure Event irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, (ii) Parent shall 

   ##### 

  

   

promptly amend the Registration Statement to reflect the Change in Structure
Event and file as soon as practicable with the SEC the amended Registration
Statement, (iii) the Company shall promptly prepare the Proxy Statement and
file as soon as practicable with the SEC the Proxy Statement and (iv) the
parties shall otherwise, upon the conditions and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, proceed to consummate a One Step Merger as contemplated by
this Agreement. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this Section
1.5 prior to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer,
Merger Sub shall promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Stock to the
tendering stockholders. 

   

 Section 2\. _The Merger_. 

  

 The Merger described in this Section 2 shall govern the Second Step Merger or, if a Change in Structure Event has occurred, the One Step Merger. The parties acknowledge that in the event of a Second Step Merger, the Company Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been converted into shares of Company Common Stock no later than immediately prior to the Acceptance Date and such shares of Company Common Stock, if the Stockholder Parties comply with the tendering procedures set forth in the Stockholder Agreements, shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn in connection with the Offer. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if following the Offer and any Subsequent Offering Period and the exercise, if any, of the Top Up Option, the requirements of Section 253 of the DGCL are satisfied such that the Merger may be effected without a vote of stockholders of the Company, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable on such basis and in any event within one (1) business day after the Acceptance Date.

 (a) _Conversion of Shares of Company Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Stock (other than shares of Company Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting Shares (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) $7.70 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.217 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ " provided that if the Offer Price is changed and shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, a corresponding change shall be made to the Merger Consideration). 

   

 (b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

All shares of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, the Company, or Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Dissenting Shares_  

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of shares of 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Stock who are entitled to demand and who have properly demanded and
perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the holders
thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262
of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders shares of Company Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the
right to receive, subject to Section 3.5 and Section 3.6, the Merger
Consideration as set forth in this Section 3. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any appraisal demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Company Options and Restricted Shares_. Except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

   

 (a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Options_ ") granted under the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the Amended and Restated 2000 Restricted Stock Grant Plan (collectively, the " _Equity Incentive Plans_ "), shall become fully vested and exercisable (without regard to whether the Company Options are then vested or exercisable) and (ii) at the Effective Time, all Company Options not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, converted into the right to receive a payment of the Merger Consideration calculated as follows: The excess, if any, of (A) the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (such sum, the " _Company Share Value_ ") over (B) the exercise price of a Company Option will be multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company Option and such product will be divided by the Company Share Value. Such quotient, rounded to the nearest whole number, is referred to herein as the " _Option Share Equivalent_." Each Option Share Equivalent shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Any Company Option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Company Share Value shall not receive any Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which was granted prior to the date hereof and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions. 

   

 (c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Equity Incentive Plans remain in full force and effect and (ii) no person shall have any right under the Equity Incentive Plans, except as set forth herein. 

   

 (d) At or promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver the applicable Merger Consideration to holders of Company Options without interest. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient funds and shares of Parent Common Stock to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Options in respect of the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3. 

   

 Section 3.4 _Exchange Procedures; Exchange Agent_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) Not less than three (3) business days prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Date and the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or shares of Company Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent and US Corp. shall or shall cause Merger Sub to deposit with the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement providing for the matters set forth in this Section 3.4 and such other matters as may be appropriate and the terms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount in cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to effect the conversion of each share of the Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares) into the Merger Consideration. In addition, Parent and US Corp. shall or shall cause Merger Sub to deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.8 and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(d). All cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent;  _provided however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Stock shall be entitled under this Section 3, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional cash and certificates with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. 

   

 (c) _Exchange of Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each (i) record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or (ii) holder, as of the Effective Time, of Book-Entry Shares, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time, shall contain instructions for wire transfer at the expense of such holder of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the duly executed transmittal materials, such other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent and, as applicable, any Certificates to the Exchange Agent). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or applicable book-entry shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by this Section 3.4(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 3. 

   

 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the shares of Company Stock shall be paid 

   ##### 

  

   

to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until
those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this
Section 3\. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to those shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to those shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after
the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
surrender. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate (subject to the provisions of Section 3.2) the Merger Consideration with respect thereto without interest. 

   

 (f) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock will be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall (subject to the provisions of Section 3.2) be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3 without interest. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.

 Section 5.16 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company (without giving effect to any qualifications as to knowledge of the Company, materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications or any disclosures in the Company SEC Reports or the Company Disclosure Schedule) as of the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing, immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation and Parent will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 5.16, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to the Surviving Corporation and Parent means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such terms are generally determined in accordance with the applicable Delaware, Canadian or federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become

 Section 5.17 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from GE Capital Corporation (the " _Lender_ ") to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Other than as permitted pursuant to Section 7.9, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and, as of the date hereof, the commitments contained in such letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "), and no Person has any right to impose, and none of Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept, (i) any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor (ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letter below an amount that when combined with Parents other cash and/or cash equivalents will be sufficient to pay the Transaction Amount on the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing (or any term or condition not included in the Debt Commitment Letter which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount under the Debt Commitment Letter below an amount that when combined with Parents other cash and/or cash equivalents will be sufficient to pay the Transaction Amount on the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing). Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if applicable, any alternative debt commitment letter entered into pursuant to Section 7.9) is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of US Corp. and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The Debt Commitment Letter may, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Effective Time by an instrument (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") replacing the existing Debt Commitment Letter, provided that the terms of the New Debt Commitment Letter shall not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (B) delay the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing or (C) reduce the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letter below an amount that when combined with Parents other cash and/or cash equivalents will be sufficient to pay the Transaction Amount on the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing (or include any term or condition not in the Debt Commitment Letter which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount under the Debt Commitment Letter below an amount that when combined with Parents other cash and/or cash equivalents will be sufficient to pay the Transaction Amount on the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Closing). In such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to be to the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3 and compliance with Section 6.1(b) in all material respects, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter together with Parents other cash and/or cash equivalents will in the aggregate be sufficient for Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate cash to be paid pursuant to the Offer, the Cash Consideration and any other payments contemplated in this Agreement to be paid by Parent on the Acceptance Date and the Closing Date and to pay all fees and expenses of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries related to the Debt Financing, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such amount, the " _Transaction Amount_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter, and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not 

    ##### 

  

     

have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to
Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub on the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the
Closing.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (substituting "seventy percent (70%) or more" for each reference to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the definition thereof) that the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) determines (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated and (ii) if consummated would result in a transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any written proposal from Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement). The Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in any event within the earlier of (i) one business day or (ii) 48 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer, proposal or inquiry that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or after any request for information is sought or initiated, notify Parent orally and in writing and disclose the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry, including the identity of the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry and provide a copy thereof if in writing and any related available material documentation or correspondence from such Person or Persons or any of their respective Representatives to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives and from the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives to such Person or Persons or their respective Representatives (it being understood that delivery of 

     ##### 

  

    

such notice to Parent in accordance with the notice provisions of this
Agreement, shall not, in and of itself, entitle Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1). The Company will keep Parent informed on
a prompt basis of the status and any material discussions, negotiations and
developments (including material amendments and proposed material
amendments) relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any such offer, proposal
or inquiry. The Company agrees that it will promptly request each Person that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential

 (c) Except as set forth in this subsection (c) or subsection (d), neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation of the Company Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, the Stockholder Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the Company Recommendation (any such action under this clause (i), a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve, recommend or adopt (or publicly propose to approve, recommend or adopt) any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, recommend, adopt or allow the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, option agreement or similar arrangement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than the confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing if after the date hereof and prior to the Relevant Date the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, then prior to the Relevant Date, (x) the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to make a Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action is or would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company may enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and/or recommend or approve such Acquisition Proposal, in the case of each of clause (x) and clause (y), if the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action is or would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement, making such Change in Recommendation or recommending or approving such Acquisition Proposal terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) and pays the applicable termination fee to Parent concurrently with such termination. The Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) or make a Change in Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or recommend or approve such Superior Proposal (A) until after the second (2nd) business day following the Companys delivery to Parent of a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action and providing Parent with a copy of all agreements and proposed agreements and all material correspondence and other documentation from such Person or Persons or any of their respective Representatives to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives and from the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives to such Person or Persons or their respective Representatives relating to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that (1) in determining whether to cause or permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement or take such other actions, the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in any written proposal in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, and (2) any material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that any amendment to the financial terms thereof is a material amendment) shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new two (2) business day period), (B) unless during the applicable notice period after providing the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) unless the Company has 

    ##### 

  

    

complied in all material respects with this Section 6.2 and (D) unless and
until the Company has paid, or concurrently pays, to Parent the termination
fee due Parent pursuant to Section 9.2. 

   

 (d) In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Relevant Date the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may, other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, make a Change in Recommendation if the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation is or would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, neither the Company Board of Directors (nor any committee thereof) shall be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has provided to Parent at least two business days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail. 

   

 (e) Any Change in Recommendation shall not change the approval of this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements or any other approval of the Company Board of Directors in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders, if in any such case the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that it is required to do so under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.2(f) nor the taking of any action in accordance with this Section 6.2 shall limit or modify in any way the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1;  _provided, further however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation, unless the Company Board of Directors expressly and concurrently with such disclosure (i) reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger and that they tender their shares in the Offer and (ii) rejects any other Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by a Change in Recommendation, (ii) in any case in which a Change in Recommendation occurs, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to a vote of its stockholders, and (iii) the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or propose to do so. 

   

 (h) If any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates takes any action that the Company is not permitted to take under this Section 6.2, it shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2 by the Company.

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated, (ii) provide each such Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements and (iii) to the extent that any Continuing Employee is allowed to participate in any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries following the Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and vacation and severance benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual under any other plan) to the extent of such service. 

   

 (c) Parent and Company acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 6.3 shall not interfere with the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Plan (subject to the provisions of Section 6.3(a) and (b) above) or to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason, subject to the terms of applicable Employment Agreements.

Prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party (provided that the Company has used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such other party to such Contract or establish a workaround to such prohibition) or as would be reasonably expected to violate the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any Subsidiary (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation), the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its directors, employees, representatives, financial advisors, lenders, legal counsel, accountants and other advisors and representatives, such access to the books and records, financial, operating and other data, assets, properties, facilities, plants, offices, auditors, authorized representatives, business and operations of the Company as is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Any investigation and examination by Parent shall be conducted at reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or impairment of the Companys business. In order that Parent may have a full opportunity to make such investigation and, provided such persons are bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, or have otherwise agreed to be bound by the provisions of such agreement applicable to representatives, the Company shall 

    #####

information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the
Company in the Companys possession as such representatives may reasonably
request. The information and documents provided pursuant to this Section 7.3

the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the execution and delivery or termination of this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make, and shall cause their affiliates or owners to use reasonable best efforts to make, all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications or submissions of other documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i) the filings identified on the Company Disclosure Schedule that are required to be made with a Governmental Entity, (ii) pre-merger notification reports to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice as required by the HSR Act (which filing shall be made as promptly as practicable), and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and any applicable state or provincial securities or "blue sky" laws, or any other applicable Laws or rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity relating to, and material to the consummation of, the Offer and the Merger. In the event the Company does not obtain a determination from the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance that the Company is either directly or indirectly or through its affiliates primarily engaged in a business other than the business of insurance (the " _Determination_ "), Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the date the Company has received notification from the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance that the Determination will not be granted, file a Form A application with the Delaware Department of Insurance. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity that requires a Form A application in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 (c) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions required by Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall notify the others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments or questions from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto, or pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to any applicable Laws, or for answers to any questions, or for the production of any documents, relating to an investigation of the Offer or the Merger by any Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 7.4(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other parties (or their respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Entity relating to the Offer or the Merger. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger shall include representatives of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company. Subject to applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in 

    ##### 

  

    

connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
regarding the Offer or the Merger by or on behalf of any party.

In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary actions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to take or accept or to cause its affiliates to take or accept (and the Company shall not agree to and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to agree to), any action or condition that, when taken together with all other actions or conditions, would in Parents good faith judgment result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No action taken by the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Representatives in compliance with the express terms of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 6.2, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4.

Until the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time (or until such later date as any claims then still pending shall have been resolved), Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of (i) the Company and the Surviving Corporation under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws and (ii) the Company pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Companys directors, officers, employees or agents existing at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

 (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and, from and after the earlier of the Acceptance Date or the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (x) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, agent or other fiduciary of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (y) any act or omission by an Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)) or (z) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened Action, investigation or inquiry with respect to which such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.5, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) shall, and Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) to, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, promptly (and in any event no later than twenty (20) days following any request therefor) advance to such Indemnified Party his or her reasonable legal expenses (including the reasonable cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith);  _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent then required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (c) Parent shall be entitled (but shall not be obligated) to control the defense of any such Action, investigation or inquiry with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without Parents written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification hereunder. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle any such Action, investigation or inquiry without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and (ii) includes only the payment of money. 

   

 (d) Parent shall provide and maintain in effect, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide and maintain in effect, for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, for the benefit of the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is at least as favorable (with respect to coverage, amounts, limits, deductibles and conditions) as the Companys existing policy; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (the " _Company s Current Premium_"). If such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of the Companys Current Premium, then Parent shall maintain the maximum amount of coverage under a policy having the same deductible as is available for such 250% of the Companys Current Premium. The Company represents 

    ##### 

  

 

and warrants to Parent that the Companys Current Premium is as set forth on
Section 7.5(d) or the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause coverage to
be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy, provided that the cost of such tail coverage does not exceed the
amount as set forth on Section 7.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If
Parent is unable to obtain such tail policy, Parent shall provide the Company
with notice thereof at least five business days prior to the earlier of the
Acceptance Date and the Closing. If the Company receives such notice from
Parent, the Company may purchase such tail policy, provided that the cost of
such tail coverage does not exceed the amount as set forth on Section 7.5(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such tail policy, whether purchased by
Parent or the Company, shall satisfy Parents and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this Section 7.5(d). Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their officers or directors, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.5 is not in substitution for
any such claims under such policies.

and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the
purpose of establishing collateral arrangements; provided, however, that such
access and information shall only be provided to the extent that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company such access or the provision of such
information would not violate applicable Law and (B) establish bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing, provided that such accounts, agreements and
arrangements will not become active or take effect until the Effective Time,

representation letter in respect of information provided by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in writing expressly for use in connection with the Debt
Financing or the syndication thereof, for the benefit of the arrangers of the
Debt Financing and lenders and proposed lenders to Parent, US Corp. and
Merger Sub in the Debt Financing; provided, that Parent, US Corp. and
Merger Sub may not place, and hereby disclaim, any reliance by either of them

Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or incur any other liability prior to the Effective Time or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing, unless such liability or indemnity is

terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation, provided that the Company furnish Parent

reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,

and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and   against any and all out of pocket losses and
expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with third-party claims
arising out of or resulting from the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
alternative financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
except for any matters arising out of or resulting from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of any such person. The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to

Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and be of no further force or effect, except for the last sentence of Section 7.3, Section 7.7, Section 7.9(b), Section 9, Section 10, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 23, 2008, between the Company and Parent (the " _Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof and survive any termination of this Agreement,  _provided, however_ , that, nothing herein shall relieve a party from liability for damages for any willful breach hereof occurring prior to such termination. If a party brings a claim after the termination of this Agreement for a willful breach hereof occurring prior to such termination, the party that is determined by a final and non appealable order to have lost such claim shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the other party. 

   

 (b) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $5,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company. 

   

 (c) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee no later than one business day following such termination. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b), and if (i) after the date hereof and prior to the End Date, an Acquisition Proposal was disclosed to the Company, is publicly announced or generally made known to the Companys stockholders, or any Person or group of Persons informs the Company or publicly announces or makes generally known to the Companys stockholders that it intends to make an Acquisition Proposal subject to this Agreement being terminated, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with the earlier of the entry into such definitive agreement or consummation of any Acquisition Proposal; _provided,_ that, solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(d), the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 6.2(a), except that all references to twenty percent (20%) or more therein shall be changed to a majority or more. 

   

 (e) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h), and if (i) after the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal was disclosed to the Company, is publicly announced or generally made known to the Companys stockholders, or any Person or group of Persons informs the Company or publicly announces or makes generally known to the Companys stockholders that it intends to make an Acquisition Proposal subject to this Agreement being terminated, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any 

    ##### 

  

    

Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with the earlier of the
entry into such definitive agreement or consummation of any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, that, solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(e), the
term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section
6.2(a), except that all references to twenty percent (20%) or more therein
shall be changed to a majority or more. 

   

 (f) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), and if (i) after the date hereof and prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal was disclosed to the Company, is publicly announced or generally made known to the Companys stockholders, or any Person or group of Persons informs the Company or publicly announces or makes generally known to the Companys stockholders that it intends to make an Acquisition Proposal subject to this Agreement being terminated, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with the earlier of the entry into such definitive agreement or consummation of any Acquisition Proposal; _provided,_ that, solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(f), the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 6.2(a), except that all references to twenty percent (20%) or more therein shall be changed to a majority or more. 

   

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(h) or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(g), then the Company shall reimburse Parent upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid by or on behalf of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent in connection with this Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby), the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of counsel, investment banking firms, accountants and consultants and lenders; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to make payments pursuant to this Section 9.2(g) in excess of $2,000,000.00; _provided, further_ , than any payments by the Company made pursuant to this Section 9.2(g) shall be credited against any Termination Fee that is or becomes payable. 

   

 (h) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.2(a) through 9.2(g), as applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a final non-appealable judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses actually incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of J.P. Morgan Chase N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was required to be made until the date such payment is actually made. All amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by Parent. 

   

 Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 7.5(b), Section 7.5(f), Section 7.9(b) and Section 9.2, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, including all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of, the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of the Company Stockholder Approval, 

    ##### 

  

 

regulatory filings and notices and all other matters related to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, but if the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, thereafter no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the Companys stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. In addition, following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement shall only be effected if there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or by the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director). 

   

 Section 9.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may, by action authorized by its Board of Directors, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any documents delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of any other party or any conditions to its own obligations; _provided,_ that any such extension or waiver shall be binding upon a party only if such extension or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such party;  _provided, further_ , that such extension or waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. In addition, following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or its stockholders (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates), officers, directors or employees shall only be effected if there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and such waiver is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or by the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director).

Company in Sections 1, 2, 3, 6.3 and 7.5 and those other covenants and

 (a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided,_ that Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub may assign any of its rights hereunder (but effective only if and when the Merger is consummated) to any of the lenders in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing.

Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement, or invalid or unenforceable portion thereof, with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision or portion thereof. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

   

 Section 10.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in such Delaware state or federal court. Each of the Company, Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT, US CORP. AND MERGER SUB WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 10.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury could be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to all other remedies available to it any other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction (without posting a bond or other undertaking) to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or to restrain any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement.

 Section 10.11 _No Waiver of Rights_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. 

   

 Section 10.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be acceptable and binding.

Whenever this Agreement requires any Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

permitted) by Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent and

of Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the

The obligations of the Stockholder specified in this Section 3.1(a) shall
apply whether or not the Offer, the Merger or any action described above is
recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company. Any such vote shall be
cast (or consent shall be given) by the Stockholder in accordance with such
procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including
for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1(a), in the event of a Change in Recommendation made in compliance with the Merger Agreement, the obligation of the Stockholder to vote (or cause to be voted), or to deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent with respect to, the Covered Shares in the manner set forth in this Section 3.1 shall, with respect to any combined vote of holders of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock, only apply to an aggregate number of Covered Shares entitled to vote in respect of such matter that is equal to 30% of the total vote of the shares of Company Stock entitled to vote in respect of such matter, and shall terminate, together with the authority of each of the proxies set forth in Section 3.3, with respect to the balance of the Covered Shares, and the Stockholder may vote (or cause to be voted), or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent with respect to, such balance of its Covered Shares as the Stockholder, in its sole discretion, determines. 

   

 3.2. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except for this Agreement or as set forth in Section 7 of the Certificate of Designations, and except as may be permitted by Section 5.4(b), it (a) has not entered into, and shall not enter into at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Covered Shares with respect to any of the matters described in Section 3.1(a)(ii) (the " _Section 3.1(a) Matters_"), (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while this Agreement remains in effect (except pursuant to Section 3.3), a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Covered Shares with respect to any of the Section 3.1(a) Matters and (c) has not knowingly taken and shall not knowingly take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling the Stockholder from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 3.3. _Proxy_. Without in any way limiting the Stockholders right to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion on any matters other than the Section 3.1(a) Matters that may be submitted to a stockholder vote, consent or other approval, the Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, Gordon Glenn and Jeffrey Park, pursuant to a proxy to be delivered to Parent substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex A, in their respective capacities as officers of Parent, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any such officer of Parent, and any other Person designated in writing by Parent (collectively, the " _Grantees_ "), each of them individually, with full power of substitution, to vote or execute written consents with respect to the Covered Shares as to which the Stockholder controls the right to vote in accordance with Section 3.1 (or, if applicable, only such portion of the Covered Shares as is provided in Section 3.1(b)) and, in the discretion of the Grantees, with respect to any proposed postponements or adjournments of any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which any of the Section 3.1(a) Matters was to be considered. This proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the earliest of (i) the Operative Date, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (iii) the termination of 

   ##### 

 

    

this Agreement in accordance with its terms, in which event this proxy shall
automatically be revoked without any further action by any party. The
Stockholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments
as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes
any proxy previously granted by it with respect to the Covered Shares with
respect to any of the Section 3.1(a) Matters. So long as the proxy granted
under this Section 3.3 is a valid uncontested proxy that is effective to
deliver the votes of the Covered Shares (or, if applicable, only such portion
of the Covered Shares as is provided in Section 3.1(b)), the Stockholder shall
be deemed to be fulfilling its obligations under Section 3.1. If Parent
believes that such proxy is not a valid proxy or if Parent otherwise does not
wish to utilize the proxy, Parent will so notify the Stockholder in writing
so that the Stockholder will be able to perform its obligations under Section
3.1.

Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. This Agreement is the product of negotiation by the parties having
the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the
parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one
party than with regard to the others. 

  

 6.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 6.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and, to the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto, embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written and oral, that may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

  

 6.8. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any appellate court of the State of Delaware) and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 6.8. 

   

 6.9. _Amendment; Waiver; Expenses_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Each party may waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by such party and delivered to Parent, the Company and the Stockholder. 

   

 (b) The Stockholder agrees that it is solely responsible (without reimbursement from the Company) for all costs and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Stockholder in connection with this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. 

   

 6.10. _Remedies_. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. 

  

 6.11. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner adverse to any party or its stockholders or partners, as applicable. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. 

  

 6.12. _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (by operation of law or otherwise), by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.13. _Stockholder Capacity_. The restrictions and covenants of the Stockholder hereunder shall not be binding, and shall have no effect, in any way with respect to any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such Persons capacity as such a director or officer, nor shall any action taken by any such director or officer in his or her capacity as such be deemed a breach by the Stockholder of this Agreement.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

IRREVOCABLE PROXY  

  

Dated as of February 25, 2008  

  

 The undersigned Stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of National Medical Health Card Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent permitted by law) appoints Gordon Glenn and Jeffrey Park, as the sole and exclusive attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with respect to all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are or hereafter may be beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all other shares or securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Covered Shares_ "), in accordance with the terms of this Proxy. The Covered Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholder as of the date of this Proxy are listed on the signature page of this Proxy, along with the number(s) of the stock certificate(s) representing such Covered Shares. Upon the Stockholders execution of this Proxy, any and all prior proxies given by the undersigned with respect to any Covered Shares are hereby revoked and terminated, and the Stockholder agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the Covered Shares, with respect to any of the matters referred to in any of clauses (a) through (c) below until after the Expiration Time (as defined below). 

  

 This Proxy is irrevocable (to the fullest extent permitted by law), is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain Stockholder Agreement of even date herewith (the " _Stockholder Agreement_ ") by and among SXC Health Solutions Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of Yukon Territory, Canada (" _Parent_ "), the Company and the undersigned Stockholder of the Company, and is granted in consideration of Parent entering into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may hereafter be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Parent, SXC Health Solutions, Inc., a Texas corporation (" _US Corp_."), Comet Merger Corporation, a newly-formed Delaware corporation that is wholly-owned by US Corp. and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will commence an exchange offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), and following the consummation of the Offer (or, subject to certain conditions, in lieu thereof), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the Stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration specified therein. The term " _Expiration Time_ ", as used in this Proxy, shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) the Operative Date, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the termination of the Stockholder Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby authorized and empowered by the Stockholder, at any time prior to the Expiration Time, to act as the Stockholders attorney and proxy to vote all of the Covered Shares (or, if applicable, only such portion of the Covered Shares as is provided in Section 3.1(b) of the Stockholder Agreement), and to exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with respect to all of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Covered Shares (or, if applicable, only such portion of the Covered Shares as
is provided in Section 3.1(b) of the Stockholder Agreement) (including,
without limitation, the power to execute and deliver written consents) at
every annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company (and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof), and in every written consent in lieu of
such meeting: 

  

 (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any related proposal in furtherance thereof, as reasonably requested by Parent, submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders; 

  

 (b) against any action or agreement submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders that the Stockholder knows is in opposition to, or competitive or materially inconsistent with, the Offer or the Merger or that the Stockholder knows would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the Stockholder contained in the Stockholder Agreement; and 

  

 (c) against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and against any other action, agreement or transaction submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders that the Stockholder knows would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, frustrate the purposes of or adversely affect the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Merger Agreement or by the Stockholder of its obligations under the Stockholder Agreement, including, but not limited to: (A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; (B) any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company (including capital stock or other equity interests in its Subsidiaries) or any subsidiary of the Company; (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; (D) any change in a majority of the board of directors of the Company; (E) any amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (except for any amendment to increase the authorized capital stock); and (F) any change in the capitalization of the Company or the Companys corporate structure. 

  

 Any term or provision of this Proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Stockholder agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Proxy shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Stockholder agrees to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with 

   ##### 

  

    

a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term. 

  

 The restrictions and covenants of the Stockholder hereunder shall not be binding, and shall have no effect, in any way with respect to any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such Persons capacity as such a director or officer, nor shall any action taken by any such director or officer in his or her capacity as such be deemed a breach by the Stockholder of this Proxy. 

  

 Any obligation of the Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Stockholder. 

  

 This Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and effect, automatically upon the Expiration Time.

The Company agrees that as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement it shall give such stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Company Stock and to legend the share certificates. The Company agrees that, (i) if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, then, promptly following the termination of this Agreement, (ii) if Merger Sub accepts the Covered Shares for payment pursuant to the terms of the Offer, then, concurrently with such acceptance (and in any event within such time as would not delay receipt by the Stockholder of the Offer Price), or (iii) if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are effected as a One Step Merger, then, immediately following the Closing (and in any event within such time as would not delay receipt by the Stockholder of the Merger Consideration), the Company will cause any stop transfer instructions imposed pursuant to this Section 6.2 to be lifted and any legended certificates delivered pursuant to this Section 6.2 to be replaced with certificates not bearing such legend. 

  

 (b) Each certificate representing Covered Shares held of record by the Stockholder shall bear the following legend on the face thereof: 

  

 "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING, TRANSFER AND CERTAIN OTHER LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THAT CERTAIN STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 25, 2008, AMONG SXC HEALTH SOLUTIONS CORP., NEW MOUNTAIN AFFILIATED INVESTORS, L.P. AND NATIONAL MEDICAL HEALTH CARD SYSTEMS, INC., AS THE SAME MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, COPIES OF WHICH STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT ARE ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF NATIONAL MEDICAL HEALTH CARD SYSTEMS, INC." 

  

 The Stockholder will cause all of its Existing Shares held of record by the Stockholder and any securities that become Covered Shares held of record by the Stockholder after the date hereof to be delivered to the Company for the purpose of applying such legend (if not so endorsed upon issuance). The Company shall return to the delivering party, as promptly as possible, any securities so delivered. The delivery of such securities by the delivering party shall not in any way affect such partys rights with respect to such securities. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.3. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder, and Parent shall have no authority to direct the Stockholder in the voting or disposition of any of the Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

 6.5. _Interpretation_. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement is the product of negotiation by the parties having the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one party than with regard to the others. 

  

 6.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 6.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and, to the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto, 

   ##### 

  

    

embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties,
written and oral, that may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way. 

  

 6.8. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any appellate court of the State of Delaware) and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 (b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 6.8. 

  

 6.9. _Amendment; Waiver; Expenses_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Each party may waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by such party and delivered to Parent, the Company and the Stockholder. 

  

 (b) The Stockholder agrees that it is solely responsible (without reimbursement from the Company) for all costs and expenses (including all fees and expenses of 

   ##### 

  

    

counsel) incurred by the Stockholder in connection with this Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement. 

  

 6.10. _Remedies_. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. 

  

 6.11. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner adverse to any party or its stockholders or partners, as applicable. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. 

  

 6.12. _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (by operation of law or otherwise), by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 6.13. _Stockholder Capacity_. The restrictions and covenants of the Stockholder hereunder shall not be binding, and shall have no effect, in any way with respect to any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such Persons capacity as such a director or officer, nor shall any action taken by any such director or officer in his or her capacity as such be deemed a breach by the Stockholder of this Agreement.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

IRREVOCABLE PROXY  

  

Dated as of February 25, 2008  

  

 The undersigned Stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of National Medical Health Card Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent permitted by law) appoints Gordon Glenn and Jeffrey Park, as the sole and exclusive attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with respect to all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are or hereafter may be beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all other shares or securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Covered Shares_ "), in accordance with the terms of this Proxy. The Covered Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholder as of the date of this Proxy are listed on the signature page of this Proxy, along with the number(s) of the stock certificate(s) representing such Covered Shares. Upon the Stockholders execution of this Proxy, any and all prior proxies given by the undersigned with respect to any Covered Shares are hereby revoked and terminated, and the Stockholder agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the Covered Shares, with respect to any of the matters referred to in any of clauses (a) through (c) below until after the Expiration Time (as defined below). 

  

 This Proxy is irrevocable (to the fullest extent permitted by law), is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain Stockholder Agreement of even date herewith (the " _Stockholder Agreement_ ") by and among SXC Health Solutions Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of Yukon Territory, Canada (" _Parent_ "), the Company and the undersigned Stockholder of the Company, and is granted in consideration of Parent entering into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may hereafter be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Parent, SXC Health Solutions, Inc., a Texas corporation (" _US Corp_."), Comet Merger Corporation, a newly-formed Delaware corporation that is wholly-owned by US Corp. and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will commence an exchange offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), and following the consummation of the Offer (or, subject to certain conditions, in lieu thereof), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the Stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration specified therein. The term " _Expiration Time_ ", as used in this Proxy, shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) the Operative Date, (ii) a Change in Recommendation, (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iv) the termination of the Stockholder Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby authorized and empowered by the Stockholder, at any time prior to the Expiration Time, to act as the Stockholders attorney and proxy to vote all of the Covered Shares, and to exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with respect to all of the Covered Shares 

   ##### 

  

 

(including, without limitation, the power to execute and deliver written
consents) at every annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company
(and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and in every written
consent in lieu of such meeting: 

   

 (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any related proposal in furtherance thereof, as reasonably requested by Parent, submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders; 

  

 (b) against any action or agreement submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders that the Stockholder knows is in opposition to, or competitive or materially inconsistent with, the Offer or the Merger or that the Stockholder knows would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the Stockholder contained in the Stockholder Agreement; and 

  

 (c) against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and against any other action, agreement or transaction submitted for the vote or written consent of stockholders that the Stockholder knows would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, frustrate the purposes of or adversely affect the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Merger Agreement or by the Stockholder of its obligations under the Stockholder Agreement, including, but not limited to: (A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; (B) any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company (including capital stock or other equity interests in its Subsidiaries) or any subsidiary of the Company; (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; (D) any change in a majority of the board of directors of the Company; (E) any amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (except for any amendment to increase the authorized capital stock); and (F) any change in the capitalization of the Company or the Companys corporate structure. 

  

 Any term or provision of this Proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Stockholder agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Proxy shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Stockholder agrees to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. 

   ##### 

  

  

 The restrictions and covenants of the Stockholder hereunder shall not be binding, and shall have no effect, in any way with respect to any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such Persons capacity as such a director or officer, nor shall any action taken by any such director or officer in his or her capacity as such be deemed a breach by the Stockholder of this Proxy. 

  

 Any obligation of the Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Stockholder. 

  

 This Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and effect, automatically upon the Expiration Time.

  _Certificate of Amendment_  

   

CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT OF 
 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF 
 SERIES A 7% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF 
 NATIONAL MEDICAL HEALTH CARD SYSTEMS, INC.  

  

(Pursuant to Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware)  

  

 



 

     

 National Medical Health Card Systems, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY: 

   

 1\. That by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") pursuant to Section 151(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and by a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights (the "Series A Certificate of Designations") filed in the office of the Secretary of the State of Delaware effective as of March 19, 2004, the Corporation authorized shares of Series A 7% Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.10 par value per share, of the Corporation (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and established the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights of the Series A Preferred Stock and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. 

   

 2\. That the Board deemed it advisable to amend the Series A Certificate of Designations as set forth herein (the "Amendment to the Series A Certificate of Designations"). 

   

 3\. That the stockholders of the Corporation adopted the Amendment to the Series A Certificate of Designations in accordance with the provisions of Sections 228 and 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

   

 4\. That the Series A Certificate of Designations is hereby amended as follows: 

    

 Section 3(a)(iii) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 

   

 (iii) Each such dividend shall be payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date to the holders of record of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, as they appear on the stock ledger of the Corporation at 

   ##### 

  

    

the close of business on the day immediately preceding such Dividend
Payment Date. Any dividend that is not otherwise paid in cash on the
applicable Dividend Payment Date (whether due to the Corporations inability
to pay such dividend in cash or otherwise) shall automatically, and without
any action on the part of the Corporation, accrue and compound and be added
to the Accrued Value on such Dividend Payment Date. Once such dividends have
been added to the Accrued Value, dividends shall accrue and accumulate
thereon in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 3(a), as
applicable, until such time, if any, as such dividends, together with all
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, are subsequently paid in cash by
the Corporation (at which time such dividends, to the extent paid as
aforesaid, shall be deducted from the Accrued Value). Dividends shall cease
to accrue and accumulate in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock on the
Optional Redemption Date, the Redemption Date or the Conversion Date for such
shares as the case may be, unless (1) in the case of the Optional Redemption
Date or the Redemption Date, the Corporation fails to pay any amount
necessary for such redemption (including any accrued but unpaid dividends
required to be paid at such time) when due in accordance with Section 4(c) or
Section 5(c) hereof, as applicable, or, (2) in the case of a Conversion Date,
the Corporation fails to deliver certificates representing the Common Stock
or other assets or securities issuable upon such conversion within three
Business Days of the Conversion Date; in the case of either clause (1) or (2)
above, dividends shall continue to accumulate and accrue from the Redemption
Date or the Conversion Date, as the case may be, at the rate indicated above,
or from the Optional Redemption Date as set forth in Section 4(f), until such
payment (and payment of such additional dividends) and/or delivery
(and delivery of such additional shares or money owed by reason of the
continued accumulation and accrual of dividends) is made. Any holder may
request in writing that the Corporation pay any dividend or all dividends
authorized with respect to any or all Dividend Payment Dates by means of wire
transfer to an account specified by the holder in such notice. Such notice
shall not apply to a Dividend Payment Date if received less than five days
prior thereto. 

   

 Section 6 is amended to add the following paragraph (e): 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, (i) neither the entry into the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements by the Corporation or any of the other parties thereto, nor the exercise by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their rights under the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, nor the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, shall constitute a Change in Control or Liquidation, and (ii) if shares are accepted for payment in the 

   ##### 

  

    

Offer in accordance with the terms of the Offer, any shares of Series
A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such acceptance for
payment shall, upon their conversion into shares of Common Stock, only have
the right to receive the Offer Price, or, if the One Step Merger is
consummated, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the One Step Merger shall be converted into the right to receive
only the Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 8 is amended to add the following paragraph (g): 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement until the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that convert into shares of Common Stock shall convert at a ratio of one share of Common Stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock and no adjustment shall be made to such ratio. 

   

 Section 11 is amended to add the following definitions: 

   

 "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

   

 "DGCL" means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

   

 "Merger" has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement.
