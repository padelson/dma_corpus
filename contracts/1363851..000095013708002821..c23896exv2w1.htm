shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (&#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;),
in which Offer each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn would
be exchanged for (a) $7.70 in cash, without interest and (b)&nbsp;such amount of a fully paid and non
assessable common share of Parent (&#147;<U>Parent Common Stock</U>&#148;) equal to the Exchange Ratio (such

and absolute discretion pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1(i) or 1.1(j), the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;), on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

of the Second Step Merger, and each share of Company Common Stock that is not validly tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the parties have agreed that upon certain conditions, Merger Sub would terminate the
Offer and the parties would instead seek to consummate the acquisition of the Company by Parent by
a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the &#147;<U>One Step Merger</U>&#148;, the One Step
Merger or the Second Step Merger are each sometimes referred to as the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;) whereby
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock as of the effective time of the One Step
Merger would be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, following adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, all on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein;

Section&nbsp;1.2 (other than clause (e)), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Merger
Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer at the Offer
Price no later than March&nbsp;24, 2008 (and in any event as promptly as practicable after the date

Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a
