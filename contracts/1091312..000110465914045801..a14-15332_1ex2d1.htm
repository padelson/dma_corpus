of the Holders for deposit into a separate account (the " **Indemnity Escrow
Account** ") and (iii) $1,000,000 (the " **Stockholders  Representative
Expense Fund Amount**," and together with the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Initial Indemnity Escrow Amount, the " **Escrow Amount** ") to
be delivered to the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Holders for deposit into a
separate account (the " **Stockholders  Representative Expense Fund
Account**," and together with the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and
the Indemnity Escrow Account, the " **Escrow Account** "), in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Stockholders Representative
Expense Fund Amount deposited with the Escrow Agent shall be applied by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to pay
amounts owing or payable, with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account, pursuant to Section 2.13, and with respect to the Indemnity Escrow
Account and the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Account, pursuant to
Section 2.13 or Article 9, with any remaining funds to be distributed to the
Holders in accordance with Section 2.05(b), Section 2.05(c) and Section 2.13.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity Escrow Amount and all interest
and other amounts earned thereon in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
On the Escrow Release Date (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next
Business Day thereafter), an amount equal to (x) the remaining funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account at such time _less_ (y) the aggregate amount of (i)
any amounts that have been properly claimed to be payable to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.13 that remain unpaid and (ii) any Damages subject to
indemnification by Holders under Section 9.02(a) with respect to any properly
made claims outstanding on the Escrow Release Date, shall, if such amount is a
positive number, be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account and distributed
to the Holders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, if at any time funds remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Account are no longer subject to a Claim, such funds
shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account for distribution to the
Holders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. Distributions of any funds from the Indemnity Escrow
Account shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund
Amount and all interest and other amounts earned thereon in escrow pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement. On the Escrow Release Date (or, if such day is not a
Business Day, the next Business Day thereafter), the remaining funds in the
Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Account (the " **Remaining Funds**
") at such time shall be released from the Stockholders Representative
Expense Fund Account for deposit into an account designated by the
Stockholders Representative. Thereafter, based solely on the Stockholders
Representatives discretion, the Stockholders Representative shall distribute
all or a portion of the Remaining Funds, together with all interest and other
amounts earned thereon (the " **Stockholders  Representative Expense Fund
Property**"), from time to time, to the Holders based on their Pro Rata Share.
Upon deposit into the account designated by the Stockholders Representative
as prescribed above, the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Property
shall be maintained by the Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to recover the Charges from the
Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Property. The Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any funds or
other assets otherwise payable out of the Stockholders Representative Expense
Fund Property to any Holder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
Stockholders Representative is required to deduct and withhold under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Stockholders
Representative so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holders in respect of
which the Stockholders Representative made such deductions and withholding.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall, on or prior to the Escrow Release Date, deliver to the Escrow
Agent, for deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Account, an amount equal to the
Closing Cash Amount. Such amount shall be considered part of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount. If Buyer fails to make the payment required by this Section
2.05(d) the Stockholders Representative and the Holders shall not make a
claim against Buyer and their sole remedy shall be for the Stockholders
Representative to exercise its rights under the Closing Cash Amount Limited
Guaranty.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment of Shares_. (a) Each Holder whose Shares
have been converted into the right to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.04
shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to Buyer of certificates
representing Shares (the " **Common Stock Certificates** ") together with a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, the Per Share Merger Consideration
for each such Share, which amounts

 



       
 

 



 

shall be paid to the Holders for purposes of this Section 2.06, in the manner
and at the times set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Until
so surrendered, each such Common Stock Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration to the Stockholders in the following manner:

 



 

(i) If any Stockholder surrenders its Common Stock Certificates together with
a properly completed Letter of Transmittal to Buyer prior to the determination
of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, then such Stockholder shall receive in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by such
Stockholder in respect of each Share represented thereby (A) payment at the
Closing of the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares, if surrendered at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
or, if surrendered after such date, within five Business Days after such
surrender, (B) any additional payments, if any, due in respect of such Shares
pursuant to Section 2.13 following determination of the Aggregate Purchase
Price and (C) any additional payment, if any, due in respect of such Shares
pursuant to Section 2.05 following the Escrow Release Date or the distribution
of the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Property.

 



 

(ii) If any Stockholder surrenders its Common Stock Certificates together with
a properly completed Letter of Transmittal to Buyer after the determination of
the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, then such Stockholder shall receive in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by such
Stockholder in respect of each Share represented thereby payment of an amount
equal to (A) the sum of the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration and any
additional payment due in respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 2.13,
within two Business Days after such surrender and (B) any additional payment,
if any, due in respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 2.05 following the
Escrow Release Date, or the distribution of the Stockholders Representative
Expense Fund Property.

 



 

No later than three Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall
send to each Stockholder who has not completed a Letter of Transmittal on or
prior to the date hereof the Letter of Transmittal for use in exchanging his,
her or its Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Stockholder shall be
entitled to any consideration hereunder in respect of his, her or its Shares
until such Stockholder has properly completed and delivered a Letter of
Transmittal to Buyer.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Common Stock
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Common Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Surviving Corporation any transfer or other

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Common Stock Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Common Stock
Certificates are presented to Buyer, they shall be cancelled and if
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, exchanged for the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration upon compliance with Section
2.06(b). For purposes of such exchange, the cancelled Common Stock Certificate
shall be deemed surrendered pursuant to Section 2.06(b) as of the date
presented to Buyer.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding Section 2.04, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Stockholder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL ("
**Appraisal Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, unless such Holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
Holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal,
such Appraisal Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, subject to the compliance by the Holder of such Shares with
Section 2.06. The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, Buyer shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
and the procedures set forth in Section 9.05 shall otherwise apply to any such
demand as though it were a Third-Party Claim.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Cancellation and Payment of Options_. At or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each Option then issued and outstanding (whether or not
vested) shall, without any action on the part of any party hereto or the
Holder thereof, be cancelled. Prior to Closing, the Company shall take all
action necessary to ensure that each such Option is cancelled in accordance
with this Section 2.08. With respect to each Vested Option, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each Option Holder (a) at the
Effective Time the Initial Option Consideration for such Vested Option, (b)
any additional payment, if any, due in respect of such Vested Option pursuant
to Section 2.13 following determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price
and (c) any additional payment, if any, due in respect of such Vested Option
pursuant to Section 2.05 following the Escrow Release Date or the distribution
of the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Property (collectively, the "
**Option Consideration** "). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if the per-Share exercise price of any Vested Option exceeds the
Initial Per Share Merger Consideration, the Holder of such Vested Option shall
not be entitled to receive any Initial Option Consideration in respect of such
Vested Option, and the product of such (1) excess amount _multiplied_ by (2)
the number of Shares underlying such Vested Option (the " **Option Shortfall
Amount** ") shall be deducted from any amount that would otherwise be payable
in respect of such Vested Option pursuant to clause (b) above (and if the
Option Shortfall Amount exceeds such amount that would otherwise be payable in
respect of clause (b), the excess

 



      
 

 



 

shall be deducted from any amount that would otherwise be payable in respect
of such Vested Option pursuant to clause (c) above).

 



 

Section 2.09. _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
capital stock, or stock dividend thereon, or any similar event relating to the
capital stock, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration and Option
Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall
be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder or Option Holder in respect
of which the Surviving Corporation made such deduction and withholding.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Lost Certificates_. If any Common Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Common Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the execution and surrender of the Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with Section 2.06, the Surviving Corporation will pay, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Common Stock Certificate, the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented
by such Common Stock Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 



 

Section 2.12. _Pre-Closing Estimate of the Aggregate Purchase Price_. No later
than three Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " **Closing Statement** ") which shall
be signed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company (in their capacity as officers of the Company, and not in their
personal capacity), setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of (a) the
Approved Acquisition Cash, (b) the Cost Report Cash, (c) the Closing Cash and
the Closing Cash Amount (the " **Estimated Closing Cash Amount** "), (d)
Closing Indebtedness, (e) Company Transaction Expenses, (f) the CapEx
Shortfall, if any, (g) Closing Working Capital, (h) any Approved Disposition
Payments accrued and payable, but unpaid, prior to the Closing, and (i) the
Ticking Fee Amount, if any ( _provided_ that Buyer shall provide the Company
with all information reasonably necessary to calculate such amount). The
Closing Statement shall also set forth (i) the Companys calculation, using
the other amounts set forth on the Closing Statement, of the estimated
Aggregate Purchase Price (the " **Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price** "),
(ii) a list of all Option Holders, the number of Shares subject to each Option
held thereby, the applicable exercise price per Share subject to such Option,
and the number of Vested Options held by each Option Holder as of the
Effective Time and a list of all Stockholders and the number of Shares owned
by each Stockholder as of the Effective Time (including Shares issuable in
exchange of all Exchangeable Notes under Article 10 of the Exchangeable Notes
Indenture), (iii) the principal amount of any Exchangeable Notes that have not
been validly exchanged for Shares as of the Effective Time, (iv) each Holders
Pro Rata Share,

 



      
 

 



 

(v) the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration, and (vi) the Initial Option
Consideration. To the extent requested by Buyer, the Company shall promptly
provide Buyer with access to such information used by the Company in its
calculation of such amounts as is reasonably necessary for Buyer to review
such amounts ( _provided_ that, absent manifest error unless otherwise agreed
by the parties, the payments made at Closing pursuant to Section 2.06 and
Section 2.08 shall be as set forth in the Closing Statement regardless of
Buyers review or verification thereof pursuant to this Section 2.12, and
absent manifest error Buyers sole remedy in the event of any disagreement as
to the amounts of such payments shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth
in Section 2.13).

 



 

Section 2.13. _Post-Closing Adjustment_. (a) No later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Stockholders Representative a statement (the " **Post-Closing Statement** ")
setting forth Buyers calculation of (i) the Approved Acquisition Cash, (ii)
the Cost Report Cash, (iii) the Closing Cash and the Closing Cash Amount, (iv)
Closing Indebtedness, (v) Company Transaction Expenses, (vi) the CapEx
Shortfall, if any, (vii) Closing Working Capital, (viii) any Approved
Disposition Payments accrued and payable, but unpaid, prior to the Closing and
(ix) the Ticking Fee Amount, if any. Buyer shall also deliver to the
Stockholders Representative its calculation, using the amounts set forth on
the Post-Closing Statement, of the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Closing
Cash Amount. To the extent requested by the Stockholders Representative,
Buyer shall promptly provide the Stockholders Representative with access to
such information used by Buyer in its calculation of such amounts as is
reasonably necessary for the Stockholders Representative to review such
amounts.

 



 

(b) If the Stockholders Representative disagrees with Buyers calculation of
any of the items set forth on the Post-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 2.13(a), the Stockholders Representative may, within 30 days after
receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing
with such calculation, specifying the Stockholders Representatives
calculation of such amount and, in reasonable detail, the Stockholders
Representatives grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which the
Stockholders Representative disagrees, and the Stockholders Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Post-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.13(a).

 



 

(c) If the Stockholders Representative delivers a notice of disagreement
pursuant to Section 2.13(b) within such 30 day period, Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative shall, during the 15 days after delivery thereof,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the Aggregate Purchase Price and the
Closing Cash Amount.

 



 

(d) If Buyer and the Stockholders Representative are unable to reach
agreement as to such amount during such period, the parties shall promptly
thereafter cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to promptly review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Aggregate
Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount. In making such calculation, such
independent accounting firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Post-Closing Statement as to which the Stockholders Representative has
disagreed and any other items or amounts that would change as a result of the

 



      
 

 



 

independent accounting firms resolution of any such item or amount. Such
independent accounting firm shall deliver to Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth its
calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative. The cost of such review and report shall be borne (i) by the
Holders, if the difference between the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and the
Closing Cash Amount and the Stockholders Representatives calculation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount delivered pursuant to
Section 2.13(b) is greater than the difference between the Final Aggregate
Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount and Buyers calculation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount delivered pursuant to
Section 2.13(a), (ii) by Buyer, if the first such difference is less than the
second such difference and (iii) otherwise, equally by Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Holders, on the other hand. Costs for which the Holders are
responsible in accordance with the prior sentence shall be paid from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account.

 



 

(e) The Stockholders Representative and Buyer agree that they shall, and
Buyer agrees to cause its and the Surviving Corporations respective
independent accountants and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount and in
the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.13, including making
available to the extent necessary books, records, work papers and personnel.

 



 

(f) If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is determined to be less than the
Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, then Buyer shall be entitled to payment of
an amount equal to such shortfall (i) first, from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, (ii) second, to the extent such shortfall exceeds
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and (iii) third, to the extent such shortfall exceeds the sum of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount, from
the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Account, and after the making of
such payment, any remaining amounts in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account shall be promptly released or made available to the Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is determined to be
greater than or equal to the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, then the
Holders shall be entitled to payment of their respective Pro Rata Shares of an
amount equal to such excess from Buyer, and all amounts held in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released or made available to the
Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.13(f)
shall be made within three Business Days after the date on which the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price has been determined, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by Buyer or the Escrow Agent (as directed by the parties), as
the case may be, to the applicable party or parties. Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent irrevocable
instructions giving effect to any payment or release provided for by this
Section 2.13(f) in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) " **Final Aggregate Purchase Price** " means the Aggregate Purchase Price
(i) as shown in Buyers calculation thereof set forth on the Post-Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.13(a), if the Stockholders
Representative does not deliver any notice of disagreement with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.13(b) within 30 days after delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement or (ii) if the Stockholders Representative does deliver
such a notice of disagreement within such 30 day period, as agreed by Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative pursuant to Section 2.13(c) or (iii) in
the absence of such agreement, as determined by the independent accounting
firm pursuant to Section 2.13(d); _provided_ that in no event shall the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price be more than the Stockholders Representatives
calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section
2.13(b) or less than Buyers calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price
delivered pursuant to Section 2.13(a).

 



 

Section 2.14. _Deferred Compensation_. When calculating Closing Cash and
Closing Working Capital, the parties will not include any Cash or other assets
(in each case, whose book value shall be calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles) held in reserve by the Company or any Company

delay Buyers and Merger Subs consummation of the transaction contemplated by
the Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 4.05. _Financing_. (a) Buyer has delivered to the Company true and
complete copies of a fully executed commitment letter, including all annexes,
exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the " **Debt Commitment
Letter** ") and the redacted version of the related fee letter (the " **Debt
Fee Letter** "), pursuant to which the lenders and other parties thereto have
agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide Buyer with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the "
**Debt Financing** ").

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, the other parties thereto. Assuming due and valid execution by each
other party thereto, the Debt Commitment Letter is enforceable against the
parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability hereof may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Applicable Law relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.
As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any respect, and the respective commitments contained therein have
not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under
the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Buyer is not aware of any
fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations and
warranties of Buyer in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material
respect; _provided_ , _however_ that Buyer is not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties in Article 3. There are no conditions precedent directly or
indirectly related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
(including pursuant to any flex provisions) other than the conditions
precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions contained in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 and the

 



       
 

 



 

commencement and completion of the Marketing Period, Buyer has no reason to
believe that it will not be able to satisfy any term or condition of closing
of the Debt Financing that is required to be satisfied as a condition of the
Debt Financing, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be made
available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Other than the Debt Commitment Letter
and Debt Fee Letter, there are no side letters or other written or oral
contracts, arrangements or understandings related to the Debt Financing to
which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party (except for customary fee
letters and engagement letters relating to the Debt Financing, a redacted copy
of each of which has been provided to the Company prior to the date hereof)
that could directly or indirectly affect the timing of the Closing or the
availability of the funding in full of the Debt Financing at the Closing.
Assuming the funding of the Debt Financing in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable, the proceeds of the Debt Financing, together
with the cash on hand of Buyer, are in an amount sufficient to (i) consummate
the Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay all
related fees and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives and
(iii) satisfy all other obligations of Buyer or Merger Sub under this
Agreement. Buyer has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment
fees and any and all other fees and expenses, in each case as are required to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the date
hereof.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Debt
Financing shall not be a condition to the obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 4.06. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
the obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing, (b) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article 3 of this Agreement, and (c) any estimates, projections or
forecasts prepared by the Company have been prepared in good faith upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable and, after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt
Financing, the payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price and the payment of all
related fees and expenses, the Company on a consolidated basis will be Solvent
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
For purposes of this Agreement, " **Solvent** " when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of its businesses and (iii) such Person will be able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities in the Ordinary
Course of Business, as they mature.

 



 

Section 4.07. _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has caused H.I.G. Bayside Debt and LBO Fund II, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the " **Limited Guarantor** ") to deliver to the
Company a duly

 



      
 

 



 

executed limited guaranty (the " **Limited Guaranty** ") of the Limited
Guarantor with respect to certain matters as, and on the terms, specified
therein. The execution, delivery and performance by the Limited Guarantor of
the Limited Guaranty and the consummation by the Limited Guarantor of the
transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary limited partnership action on the part of the Limited Guarantor. As
of the date hereof, the Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a
valid and binding obligation of the Limited Guarantor, enforceable against the
Limited Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Applicable Law relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity,
and, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the
Limited Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty.

 



 

Section 4.08. _Litigation; Orders_. There is no (a) action, suit or proceeding
pending against, or to the knowledge of Buyer or Merger Sub, any investigation
pending against, or any action, suit, proceeding or investigation threatened
against, Buyer or Merger Sub before any arbitrator or any Governmental
Authority or (b) injunction, order, decree, award or judgment issued by any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority, or settlement agreement, consent
agreement, memorandum of understanding or disciplinary agreement with any
Governmental Authority, to which Buyer or Merger Sub is subject, in the case
of each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), that seeks to prevent, enjoin,
impair, alter or delay the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

 



 

Section 4.09. _Finders  Fees_. There is no financial advisor, investment
banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates which is
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.10. _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Each of Buyer and
Merger Sub acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in Article 3 and in the other Transaction Documents, none
of the Holders, the Stockholders Representative, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any other Person acting on their behalf (including any
stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent or representative of any of
the foregoing, whether in any individual, corporate or other capacity) has
made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty of any
nature to Buyer or its Affiliates, at law or in equity, with respect to
matters relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, their respective
businesses or any other matter related to or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub agrees to
accept the Company and the Company Subsidiaries without reliance upon any
express or implied representations or warranties of any nature made by or on
behalf of or imputed to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other
Person (including any stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent or
representative of any of the foregoing, whether in any individual, corporate
or other capacity), except as expressly set forth in Article 3 and in the
other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledges that no representation or warranty
has been or is made with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

(a) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates of future revenues, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or the future business and operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or (b) any other information or documents made available
to Buyer or its Affiliates or its or their counsel, accountants or advisors
with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or operations, except in each case as expressly set forth in
Article 3 and the other Transaction Documents.

information obtained by Buyer, its financing sources or their respective
representatives will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the respective
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing for a
period of seven years from and after the Closing Date (or longer if required
by Applicable Law), and from and after the Effective Time Buyer agrees to
cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to afford
promptly to the Stockholders Representative and its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to
such books and records, employees and auditors relating to the period prior to
Closing, to the extent necessary to permit the Stockholders Representative to
determine any matter relating to its (or any Holders) rights and obligations
hereunder. Any access pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Stockholders Representative
agrees to hold, and will cause its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence,
and not to disclose to any third party unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law, all
confidential documents and information provided to it pursuant to this
Section, except to the extent that such documents or information can be shown
to have been (i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by the
Stockholders Representative, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of
the Stockholders Representative or (iii) later lawfully acquired by the
Stockholders Representative from sources other than Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Notices of Certain Events_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, each Party shall promptly notify the other parties of:

 



 

(a) any notice or other communication received by it from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such
consent is already contemplated by Section 5.03 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule **;**

 



 

(b) any notice or other communication received by it from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced relating to
such party that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.14 or Section 4.08, as
applicable; or

 



 

(d) to the knowledge of such Party, any event, fact or condition that
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or

 



       
 

 



 

agreement of such Party (i) in the case of Buyer or Merger Sub, to the extent
that such breach would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions
to the Companys obligation to close set forth in Article 8 not to be
satisfied, and (ii) in the case of the Company, to the extent that such breach
would reasonably be expected to (A) cause any of the conditions to Buyers
obligation to close set forth in Article 8 not to be satisfied or (B) result
in Damages in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_ that (1) the
Companys giving of any notice required by this clause (ii) shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that such event, fact, condition or
breach, either individually or in the aggregate with other events, facts,
conditions or breaches, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect, and (2) neither the Companys giving of such notice,
nor its good faith failure to give such notice, in respect of any event, fact,
condition or breach pursuant to this clause (ii) shall by itself give Buyer
the right not to consummate the Merger, absent the failure of one or more
conditions to Buyers and Merger Subs obligations to close set forth in
Article 8 otherwise to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Financing_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all such things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (taking into account the timing of the
Marketing Period) and in any event at Closing, on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the "flex" provisions
applicable thereto), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained therein
(including the exercise of "flex" provisions) or on other terms no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer, including with respect to
conditionality and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the
timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Buyer in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements for the Debt Financing that
are within its control and otherwise comply with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter (to the extent the failure to comply with such terms would
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the amount or timing of the Debt
Financing or the availability of the Debt Financing at Closing). Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debt Financing (including,
if all conditions to the Debt Financing have been satisfied, by instructing
the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Debt Financing, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein) and to enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter at Closing, _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that Buyer shall not be required
to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against the lenders or other
Persons providing the Debt Financing. Buyer shall provide the Company, upon
reasonable request, with such information and documentation as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of all Debt
Financing activities. Buyer shall furnish correct and complete copies of all
material definitive agreements entered into by Buyer after the date hereof in
relation to the Debt Commitment Letter to the Company promptly upon their
execution if prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Date ( _provided_ that any fee information and economics contained
therein may be redacted).

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Debt Commitment Letter
or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing and/or substitute
other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing
from the same or Alternative Financing sources, in each case, without the
Companys prior written consent to the extent such amendments, supplements,
modifications or waivers would either reduce the aggregate amount of cash
proceeds available from the Debt Financing to fund the amounts required to be
paid by Buyer under this Agreement (as compared to the amount of such
aggregate proceeds contemplated under the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect
on the date hereof) or impose new or additional conditions precedent that
would be reasonably expected to (i) prevent, impede or materially delay or
impair the availability of the Debt Financing or the ability of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner
or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders and other persons
under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of
an individual lender in accordance with the terms of the syndication
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the Debt Financing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer may (without
obtaining the Companys consent) amend, supplement or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay or
impair the availability of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon
any such amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter
in accordance with this Section 5.06(b), Buyer shall provide a copy thereof to
the Company and references to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under this
Section 5.06(b) and references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
supplemented or modified under this Section 5.06(b).

 



 

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter for any reason, Buyer shall promptly notify the Company and
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing
from alternative sources (the " **Alternative Financing** ") upon terms
(including any flex provisions) that are (x) economically and with respect to
conditionality no less favorable and (y) otherwise, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to Buyer than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (and the Debt Fee
Letter), in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event (and, in any event, no later than the Closing Date). In the event any
Alternative Financing is obtained

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with this Section 5.06(c), references to "Debt Financing," "Debt
Commitment Letter" and "Debt Fee Letter" (and other like term in this
Agreement) shall include such Alternative Financing, as applicable.

 



 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to
use their reasonable best efforts to, provide, at Buyers sole expense, all
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in a reasonable number
of meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations, "road shows" and sessions
with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to
furnish Buyer and its Debt Financing Sources with financial and other
customary pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including information customarily used in the preparation of one
or more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the syndication of
the Debt Financing by the Debt Financing Sources) that is reasonably available
to the Company and necessary for the satisfaction of the obligations and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the financial
statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required under
paragraph 3 of Exhibit E of the Debt Commitment Letter and historical
financial information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries reasonably
required for Buyer to prepare the pro forma financial statements required
under paragraph 4 of Exhibit E of the Debt Commitment Letter) (the information
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (iii) being referred to as
**"Required Information** "), (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
customary accountants comfort letters, (v) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Buyer
to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing, (vi) providing all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries at least five days prior to the Closing Date as shall
have been reasonably requested in writing by Buyer at least ten days prior to
the Closing Date that is required by regulatory authorities under applicable
"know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the Patriot Act, (vii) providing authorization letters to the Debt
Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of the information required to
be delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) to prospective lenders and
containing a customary representation that such information does not contain a
material misstatement or omission as to a material fact and a customary
representation to the Debt Financing Sources that the public-side versions of
such documents, if any, do not include material non-public information about
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their securities, (viii) using its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing
for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all
indebtedness of the Company and

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Subsidiaries contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid
off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date, and (ix) assisting in the
preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive financing documents,
including guaranty and collateral documents and customary closing certificates
as may be required by the Debt Financing; _provided_ that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to enter into any such document or
instrument contemplated by the foregoing clauses prior to the Effective Time;
_provided further_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 5.06, (A) nothing in this Section 5.06(d) shall require any
such cooperation to the extent that it would (1) require the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to
the Closing, or incur any liability or give any indemnities or otherwise
commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing, (2)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (3) require the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate any
Applicable Law or result in the violation or breach of any confidentiality
provision of a contract to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof, (4) require the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to execute (except in escrow), any definitive
financing documents prior to the Effective Time or (5) result in any officer
or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries incurring any
personal liability with respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing,
(B) no action, liability or obligation of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives under any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing
shall be effective until the Closing, (C) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that any portion of any road show, ratings
agency presentation, bank information memoranda or other offer document or
information prepared in connection with the Debt Financing which relates to
Buyers intended conduct of the Companys business and operations following
Closing remains the sole responsibility of Buyer and none of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
shall have any liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with
respect thereto or be required to provide any information or make any
presentations with respect to capital structure, the incurrence of the Debt
Financing or other pro forma information relating thereto, or the manner in
which Buyer intends to operate, or cause to be operated, the business of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing and (D) Buyer
shall reimburse the Company or cause the Company to be reimbursed for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable
attorneys fees of outside counsel) incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with the actions and cooperation pursuant
to this Section 5.06. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in complying with
their obligations in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(including as a result of any action taken by them in accordance with this
Section 5.06(d)) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than historical information relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or other information furnished by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) except to the extent such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest awards,
judgments and penalties resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or
gross negligence of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives. All non-public information regarding the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries provided to Buyer and its representatives and
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.06(d) shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company hereby consents to
the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided, however_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any material breach or
material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach or material default) by any party to any Debt Commitment
Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing of which Buyer
becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to any Debt Commitment Letter with respect to any
actual or threatened breach, default, withdrawal, termination or repudiation
by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related
to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (iii) of any material
written dispute or disagreement between or among Buyer or Merger Sub and any
of the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to materially
hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iv) if for any reason Buyer or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. Buyer shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with Section
5.06(c)) and provide to the Company copies of all material definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that any fee information
and economics contained therein may be redacted).

 



 

(f) In addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (or any alternative debt commitment letter entered into
in connection with an Alternative Financing), Buyer or Merger Sub reasonably
requests that the Company file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the
1934 Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, which Buyer or Merger Sub reasonably determines
to include (and the Company does not unreasonably object to including) in a
customary offering memorandum for the Debt Financing, then, upon the Companys
review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing, the Company shall file
such Current Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public
information; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the Company be required to file any Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to
this Section

 



      
 

 



 

5.06(f) if the Company Board determines in good faith that the making of such
filing or the disclosure of such material non-public information would not be
consistent with the best interests of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and the Managed Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

 



 

Section 5.07. _Public Announcements_. The Parties agree to consult with one
another before issuing any press release or making any public statement with

public statement without the prior written consent of the other party. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be entitled to communicate with the
Holders, and the Stockholders Representative to Crestview Partners and its
affiliated investment funds and investors and potential investors therein,
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
after the Closing, each Party shall be permitted to issue press releases and
make public announcements without the consent of the other Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 5.08. _280G Matters._ To the extent that (x) any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code)
of the Company (a " **Disqualified Individual** ") would be entitled to any
payment or benefit as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events) and (y) such payment or benefit would or could potentially constitute
a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of any excise Tax imposed under Section
4999 of the Code, the Company shall, prior to the Closing:

 



 

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a binding written waiver
by such Disqualified Individual (each, an " **Excess Parachute Waiver** ") of
any portion of such parachute payment as exceeds three times such individuals
"base amount" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code less one
dollar (collectively, the " **Excess Parachute Payments** ") to the extent
such Excess Parachute Payments are not subsequently approved pursuant to a
stockholder vote in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and Treasury Regulations § 1.280G-1 thereunder (the " **280G
Shareholder Approval Requirements** "); and

a manner that satisfies the 280G Shareholder Approval Requirements in respect
of the Excess Parachute Payments payable to all such Disqualified Individuals.

(unless required by Applicable Law), it being the intent of the Parties that
the officers and directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or other
Joint Venture prior to Closing shall continue to be entitled to the rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in such
Organizational Documents.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers

reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing

(c) If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or

any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its

be prepared and timely filed, all income Tax Returns of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods that

attributable to a Straddle Period will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period as if the Tax period ended on the Closing Date, with the balance of the
income Taxes and payroll Taxes attributable to such Straddle Period being
apportioned to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall promptly pay to Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), as and when realized, the amount of any refunds or credits of
Pre-Closing Taxes (net of any Taxes imposed thereon and any reasonable
expenses in obtaining such refund or credit), other than any such refund or
credit that was taken into account in calculating the Final Aggregate Purchase
Price or is attributable to the carryback of any net operating loss or other
Tax item from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a refund or credit of the
Taxes imposed on a Consolidated Joint Venture, such payment shall be made in
proportion to the Applicable Ownership Percentage associated with such
Consolidated Joint Venture immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent the Company or any Company Subsidiary has paid estimated income Taxes
for any Tax year ending on or including the Closing Date and the amount of the
estimated Taxes paid prior to the Closing Date exceeds the amount of the
income Tax liability with respect to the relevant Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Buyer shall seek prompt refund of any such overpayment.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent
to Taxes of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries until the
applicable period for assessment under Applicable Law (giving effect to any
extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, value added, registration
stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, transfer and similar Taxes
(collectively, " **Transfer Taxes** ") incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne one-half by the
Holders (to be paid out of the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund) and
one-half by Buyer. Buyer will, at its own expense, prepare and file all
necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and the Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to review and comment upon all such Tax
Returns prior to filing. If required by applicable law, the Company will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.03. _Survival_. The covenants and agreements contained in Section
6.01 shall survive the Closing until the applicable period for assessment
under Applicable Law (giving effect to any extensions or waivers) has expired.

including any employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary
thereof in any Employee Plan, or (b) to continued employment with the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Corporation. After the Effective
Time, nothing contained in this Section 7.04 shall interfere with the right of
Buyer, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan or other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement in accordance with its terms or to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason.

certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for such shorter period as

Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until, and any claim for
breach thereof may be made at any time prior to, the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations related thereto and (b) any claim for fraud
may be made at any time without limitation. Any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or
breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given in
accordance with Section 9.05 or Section 9.06 as applicable to the party
against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time, in which case it
will survive until resolution of the claim. Any claim for indemnification by
any Buyer Indemnified Person will be sufficiently delivered if it is delivered
to the Stockholders Representative and not to all the Holders.

 



 

Section 9.02. _Indemnification by the Holders_. (a) Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article 9, from and after the Effective Time, the Holders,
severally but not jointly, in accordance with each Holders Pro Rata Share,

Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, managers, employees, partners, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " **Buyer Indemnified Persons** ") against, and to hold
each of them harmless from any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses
((x) including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses in connection with any Claim and lost profits, solely if and
to the extent such lost profits are the reasonably foreseeable consequence of
the relevant misrepresentation or breach, and are proximately caused by such
misrepresentation or breach, and in any event measured relative to the
businesses of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures as they exist as of the Closing Date, but (y) excluding any
other special, consequential, punitive, incidental, indirect and speculative
damages, such as diminution of value or damages based on a multiple of
earnings, book value, cash flow or any other metric (other than, in each case,
any such damages or losses actually paid to a third party in respect of a
Third-Party Claim)) (collectively, " **Damages** ") to the extent actually
suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons and arising out of:

 



 

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the

payable to the Option Holders pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent not
included in the calculation of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price;

 



 

(vi) subject to Buyers compliance with its obligations under Article 7
hereof, 50% of Good Reason Severance Costs with respect to any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, but only to the extent that 50% of Good
Reason Severance Costs with respect to such employee were not included in the
calculation of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price;

 



 

(vii) any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty, or
breach of a covenant or agreement, in each case made or to be performed by any
Holder in or pursuant to such Holders Letter of Transmittal (" **Letter of
Transmittal Breaches** ");

 



 

(viii) the excess, if any, of (A) the aggregate amount of any amounts required
to be paid under any guaranties existing as of the Closing Date pursuant to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has guaranteed any Indebtedness of
any other Person, except to the extent that (1) such Indebtedness has been or
will be included in the calculation of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, or
(2) the requirement to pay any such amount was caused by any action or
intentional failure to take any action by any Buyer Indemnified Person (other
than any failure to contribute cash where not expressly required to do so by
the terms of such guaranty or other contract), over (B) the aggregate amount
of any recoveries by the Company or any such Company Subsidiary from any other
Persons alleged to be responsible for such draws, including the guaranteed
parties under such guaranties (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Buyer
Indemnified Persons obligations shall have an obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover such amounts from such Persons pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 9.08(e)), in each case in this clause (viii),
during the period from and after the Closing Date, to and including the Escrow
Release Date; _provided_ that a maximum of one and only one payment shall be
made to the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to this clause (viii),
immediately prior to the release of funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account to
the Holders on the Escrow Release Date; and _provided, further_ , that in the
case of any guaranty by any Company Subsidiary, the portion of any amount
required to be paid thereunder or any recovery from any other Persons alleged
to be responsible therefor that is included in the determination of the amount
of any indemnification due pursuant to this clause (viii) shall be the
Applicable Ownership Percentage associated with such Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(ix) (A) any Approved Disposition Payment actually made by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or Managed Unconsolidated Joint Venture after the Closing,
(B) if the Approved Disposition has not been consummated on or prior to the
Closing Date, any operating losses arising from the operation of the Worcester
Surgical Center for the Worcester Operation Period and (C) if the

 



      
 

 



 

Approved Disposition has not been consummated prior to the end of the
Worcester Operation Period, any reasonable costs or expenses arising from the
shutdown and closure of the Worcester Surgical Center; or

 



 

(x) any amount paid by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to any Stockholder in respect of
any Appraisal Share in excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration and any
reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any Buyer Indemnified
Person in connection with any appraisal demand (each, an " **Appraisal
Payment** ").

 



 

(b) With respect to indemnification by the Holders pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(i), (i) Holders shall not be liable for any individual matter unless
the Damages with respect thereto, together with any related matters arising
from the same breach or that arise from the same or similar occurrence, event
or set of facts, exceed $35,000 (the " **De Minimis Amount** ") and (ii) the
Holders shall not be liable for any Damages in respect of any matter unless
and until the aggregate amount of all Damages with respect thereto
(disregarding any Damages for which the Holders are not liable pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i) exceeds $3,500,000 (the " **Deductible** "), and then
only to the extent of such excess; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
foregoing limitations shall apply to (A) breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or the representation in the last sentence of Section 3.17, or
(B) claims based on fraud. For the avoidance of doubt references in this
Agreement to the Indemnity Escrow Account shall include amounts deposited in
the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to Section 2.05(c).

 



 

(c) With respect to indemnification by the Holders for all matters pursuant to
Section 9.02(a), Buyer hereby agrees that (i) the Holders maximum aggregate
liability shall be limited to the funds contained in the Indemnity Escrow
Account, (ii) the sole and exclusive recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Persons
in respect of all such matters shall be the right to seek payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and (iii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no
right to seek payment directly from the Holders in respect of any such
matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not
apply to (A) breaches of the Fundamental Representations, (B) claims in
respect of Appraisal Payments, (C) Letter of Transmittal Breaches or (D)
claims based on fraud.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Holder
shall be liable under Section 9.02(a)(vii) (or otherwise) for any Letter of
Transmittal Breach of any other Holder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
sole and exclusive recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Persons in respect of any
Letter of Transmittal Breach of any Holder shall be the right to seek payment
(i) directly from such Holder pursuant to Section 9.03, or (ii) from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that if the Buyer Indemnified Persons seek
payment from the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of any Letter of
Transmittal Breach of any Holder, (A) any payment made from the Indemnity
Escrow Account in respect of such Letter of Transmittal Breach shall in no
event exceed such Holders share of the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account prior to such payment, and (B) such Holders share of the
amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account after

 



      
 

 



 

such payment shall be reduced accordingly so that, upon release of any funds
from the Indemnity Escrow Account, no other Holder bears liability for any
Letter of Transmittal Breach of such Holder.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Indemnification by the Stockholders_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article 9, from and after the Effective Time,
(a) the Stockholder Participants, severally but not jointly, in accordance
with each Stockholder Participants Indemnification Share as of the time
indemnification is sought, agree by delivery of a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons against, and to hold
each of them harmless from any and all Damages to the extent actually suffered
or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons and arising out of (i) any breach
of the Fundamental Representations or (ii) any Appraisal Payment, and (b) each
Stockholder Participant, individually, with respect to the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in or pursuant to his, her or its own
Letter of Transmittal only, agrees to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons
against, and to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages to the
extent actually suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons and
arising out of any of such Stockholder Participants own Letter of Transmittal
Breaches; _provided_ that in no event shall (A) any Stockholder Participant be
required to make any payment pursuant to this Section 9.03 in respect of any
breach of the Fundamental Representations unless all of the funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account have been released (it being understood and agreed
that the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have the option, in their discretion,
to seek payment pursuant to this Section 9.03 in respect of Appraisal Payments
or Letter of Transmittal Breaches directly from the Holders or from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, without regard to whether all of the funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account have been released) or (B) any Stockholder
Participant be directly liable for Damages pursuant to this Section 9.03 in
excess of such Stockholder Participants Indemnification Share or the
aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration actually received by such
Stockholder Participant to date.

 



 

Section 9.04. _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article 9, from and after the Effective Time, Buyer hereby agrees to
indemnify each Holder and its Affiliates, directors, officers, managers,
employees, partners, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
**Holder Indemnified Persons** ") against, and to hold each of them harmless
from, any and all Damages to the extent actually suffered by the Holder
Indemnified Persons and arising out of:

 



 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty made by
Buyer or Merger Sub in this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Approved Disposition Receipt (it being acknowledged and agreed that
the full amount of any Approved Disposition Receipt shall be paid over to the
Stockholders Representative for further distribution to the Holders,
notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

fact that such amount does not constitute Damages to the Holder Indemnified
Persons); or

 



 

(d) the consummation of the Closing and the Merger notwithstanding the failure
to make or obtain any notice, approval, consent or other action by or in
respect of any Governmental Authority set forth on Section 8.01(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, if and to the extent that Buyer has exercised its
right to require the Company to waive the condition set forth in Section
8.01(d) (it being acknowledged and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if and to the extent that Buyer has exercised
its right to require the Company to waive such condition, then neither the
Holders nor the Stockholder Participants shall have any obligation to
indemnify or other liability hereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
any Damages arising as a result of or in connection with the consummation of
the Closing and the Merger without such notice, approval, consent or other
action of by or in respect of such Governmental Authority having been made or
obtained).

 



 

Section 9.05. _Third-Party Claim Procedures_. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 9.02(a), Section 9.03 or Section 9.04 (the "
**Indemnified Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party
against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third party (a " **Third-Party Claim** ") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail, to the extent then known, the facts and circumstances of such Third-
Party Claim and the basis for indemnification in respect thereof (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The
Indemnified Party shall also provide the Indemnifying Party with such
additional information with respect to such Third-Party Claim as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure of the Indemnified
Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party or provide such additional
information shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.05, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of its
choice for such defense, in each case at its own expense **.**

 



 

(c) In connection with any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
assume the control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to be the
lead counsel in connection with such defense within 30 days of its receipt of
notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that prior to the Indemnifying
Party assuming control of such defense, it shall (x) demonstrate to the
Indemnified Party in writing such Indemnifying Partys financial ability to
provide full indemnification to the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim (including the ability to post any bond required by the
court or adjudicative body before which such Third-Party Claim is taking
place), and (y) agree in writing to be fully responsible for all of the
Indemnified Partys Damages relating to such Third-Party Claim; _provided,
further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

assume the control of such defense if (i) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third-Party Claim giving
rise to such claim for indemnification would be materially detrimental to or
materially injure the Indemnified Partys business or would be likely to
establish a precedential practice or custom materially adverse to the
continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, (iii) such claim seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, there
is a reasonable possibility that such remedy will be granted and, if granted,
would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the
Indemnified Party, (iv) a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, or (v) the Indemnifying Party failed or is
failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed control of the defense in accordance with this
Section 9.05, it shall keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all material
developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third-Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim,
if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates or
representatives from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim or imposes injunctive or other equitable relief on the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or representatives. The Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim
and to employ separate counsel of its choice and at its own expense for such
purpose. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim without first consulting with the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 9.06. _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 9.02(a), Section 9.03 or Section 9.04
against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a "
**Direct Claim** "), the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice
thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail to the extent then known the facts and circumstances of such
Direct Claim and the basis for indemnification in respect thereof (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The
Indemnified Party shall also provide the Indemnifying Party with such
additional information with respect to such Direct Claim as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party or provide such additional information shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.07. _Escrow Procedures_. The parties hereto agree that (a) their
respective rights and obligations with respect to the Indemnity Escrow
Account, including the funding of the requisite amounts into the Indemnity
Escrow Account, the procedure for the making of claims against the amounts in
the Indemnity Escrow Account and the release of such amounts from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, shall be governed by, and subject to the terms and
provisions of, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (b) promptly after
the determination hereunder of any amounts due from or with respect to the
Indemnity Escrow Account, they shall deliver to the Escrow Agent irrevocable
instructions giving effect to the release of such amounts in accordance with
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.08. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 9.02(a), Section 9.03 or Section 9.04, as applicable, by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor (in each case net of any costs of
collection) and (ii) Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
(in cash or as a reduction in Tax otherwise due) in the taxable year in which
such Damages occur arising from the incurrence or payment of such Damages. If
the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
after the Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment in respect of
such Damages, and which amounts were not previously deducted from the Damages
payable by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining whether there has been any misrepresentation
or breach of a representation or warranty contained herein, and for purposes
of determining the amount of Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications
or exceptions in any representation or warranty using the terms "material,"
"materiality," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or any
similar term or phrase shall be disregarded (except for the use of such terms
or phrases in Section 3.11(a) or Section 3.12 or to the extent such terms or
phrases are used to qualify an affirmative requirement to list specified items
on the Company Disclosure Schedule). The right to indemnification, payment of
any Damages or other remedy based on the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations contained herein or breach thereof will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired), at any time on or prior to the date
hereof or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
The Holders hereby acknowledge that, regardless of any investigation made (or
not made) by or on behalf of Buyer, and regardless of the results of any such
investigation, Buyer has entered into this transaction in express reliance
upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 9.02, Section
9.03 or Section 9.04, as applicable, for any Damages relating to any matter to
the extent that

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for such Damages pursuant
to the Aggregate Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.13.

 



 

(d) Upon becoming aware that it has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement, each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in the Ordinary Course of Business or as otherwise required by
Applicable Law to mitigate any Damages for which such Indemnified Party may
seek indemnification under this Agreement, and no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to any Indemnified Party for any Damages to the extent arising from
such Indemnified Partys failure to mitigate such Damages in accordance with
the foregoing. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the
Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification
provision of this Agreement in respect of such Damages, and such mitigation
was not previously taken into account when calculating the Damages payable by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying
Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit
to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys
reasonable costs of mitigation) promptly after the benefit is received.

 



 

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with the Companys practices prior to the date hereof to collect
any amounts available under applicable insurance policies, and, in the case of
Section 9.02(a)(viii), from any other Persons alleged to be responsible, for
any Damages payable under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, as applicable.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Holders or the Stockholder Participants
become liable to any Consolidated Joint Venture as a Buyer Indemnified Person
hereunder, the Holders or the Stockholder Participants, as the case may be,
shall only be required to indemnify such Consolidated Joint Venture for a
portion of the Damages suffered by such Consolidated Joint Venture that is
proportionate to the lesser of (i) Buyers percentage equity interest in such
Consolidated Joint Venture at the time at which the Damages are incurred and
(ii) the Applicable Ownership Percentage associated with such Consolidated
Joint Venture immediately prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing shall not
limit the Holders or the Stockholder Participants obligation to indemnify
any other Buyer Indemnified Person for Damages, if any, suffered by such
Person (as distinct from the Damages suffered by the Consolidated Joint
Venture) arising from the same facts and circumstances.

 



 

Section 9.09. _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time, except
with respect to claims for fraud, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Holder
Indemnified Persons for any matter or claim arising out of this Agreement, the
subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
claim for breach of contract, misrepresentation or breach of warranty and
breach of covenant or other agreement) shall be as provided by this Article 9
or the Letters of Transmittal.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any amount paid under this Article 9 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the

 



      
 

 



 

consideration paid hereunder. Any amount payable by Buyer to the Holders under
this Article 9 shall be paid to the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Stockholders  Representative_. (a) Effective upon and by
virtue of the vote of the Stockholders approving and adopting this Agreement
and the Merger pursuant to the Written Consent, and without any further act of
any of the Stockholders, the Stockholders Representative shall be hereby
appointed as the representative of the Holders and as the attorney-in-fact and
agent for and on behalf of each such Holder for purposes of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and will take such actions to be taken by the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
such other actions on behalf of such Holders as it may deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including (i) taking all actions and making all filings on
behalf of such Holders with any Governmental Authority or other Person
necessary to effect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) agreeing to, negotiating, entering
into settlements and compromises of, complying with orders of courts with
respect to, and otherwise administering and handling any claims under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on behalf of such Holders, including
indemnifications claims, (iii) negotiating and executing any waivers or
amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement ( _provided_ that any
amendment that shall adversely and disproportionately affect the rights or
obligations of any Holder shall require the prior written consent of such
Holder) and (iv) taking all other actions that are either necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholders Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. The Stockholders Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts based on contact information available to the Stockholders
Representative to keep the Holders reasonably informed with respect to actions
of the Stockholders Representative pursuant to the authority granted the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement which actions have a
material impact on the amounts payable to the Holders. Each Holder shall
promptly provide written notice to the Stockholders Representative of any
change of address of such Holder.

 



 

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall be the only party entitled to
assert the rights of the Holders with respect to any matter contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Representative hereunder shall constitute a
decision, act, consent or instruction of all Holders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of such Holders, and the Escrow Agent and
Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every such Holder. The Escrow Agent and Buyer shall be
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to recover from, at
its sole discretion, the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account (but only after
and out of any disbursement from the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account to
Holders after the

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Release Date, and only to the extent the funds in the Stockholders
Representative Fund Account have been exhausted as of the Escrow Release
Date), the Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Account or the
Stockholders Representative Expense Fund Property, prior to any distribution
to the Holders, (i) the Stockholders Representatives reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in serving in that capacity and (ii) any amounts to
which it is entitled pursuant to the indemnification provision in Section
9.11(e) (each item in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.11(c) referred to
as a " **Charge** ," and collectively the " **Charges** "). In the event the
Indemnity Escrow Account funds so distributed, the Stockholders
Representative Expense Fund Account and the Stockholders Representative
Expense Fund Property (collectively, the " **Escrow Property** ") is
insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then each Holder will be obligated to pay
its Pro Rata Share of the Charges in excess of the Escrow Property.

 



 

(d) The Stockholders Representative will incur no liability with respect to
any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such
Stockholders Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the
proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity
thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Stockholders Representative. In all questions
arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders
Representative may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the
Stockholders Representative will not be liable to any Holder for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholders Representative
based on such advice.

 



 

(e) The Holders shall severally (each based on its Pro Rata Share) but not
jointly indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold the Stockholders
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or willful misconduct, on the part of the
Stockholders Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholders Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(f) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of Holders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as
the Stockholders Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written
consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of
Holders of a majority-in-interest of those Holders must be delivered to Buyer
and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less than ten days prior to such
appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Buyer and, if
applicable, the Escrow Agent. For the purposes of this Section 9.11, a
"majority-in-interest of the Holders" shall mean Holders representing in the
aggregate over 50% of the percentage interests in the Escrow Property.

 



 

(g) In the event that the Stockholders Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in his or its capacity as Stockholders Representative,
or if the Stockholders Representative resigns as a Stockholders
Representative, a majority-in-interest of the Holders may, by written consent,
appoint a new representative as the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of the Holders
of a majority-in-interest of the Holders must be delivered to Buyer and, if
applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective upon the
later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is
received by Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent.

10.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of

satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Company to complete
the Closing, set forth in Section 8.01 or Section 8.03;

 



 

(f) by the Company, if there has been a violation or breach by Buyer or Merger

Closing), (iii) the Company and the Stockholders Representative have notified
Buyer in writing that (A) all conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section
8.02 have been and are satisfied or waived other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at Closing and that those conditions are
capable of being satisfied at Closing, and (B) they are ready, willing and
able to consummate the Closing, (iv) neither the Company nor the Stockholders
Representative has revoked such notification and (v) Buyer fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three Business Days
after receiving such written notification.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
shall give notice of such termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 10.01, subject to the provisions of Section 10.03, such
termination shall be effective as against all the parties hereto and shall be
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
parties to this Agreement; _provided_ that the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for (i) fraud and (ii)
subject to Section 10.03(b), any willful and material breach of this
Agreement. The provisions of this Section 10.02 and Section 10.03, the expense
and cost reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 5.06(d) and
the provisions of Section 11.03, Section 11.05, Section 11.06 and Section
11.07 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.03. _Termination Fee and Related Matters_. (a) If this Agreement is
validly terminated by the Company pursuant to either (i) Section 10.01(b) and
the conditions set forth in Section 10.03(c) are satisfied, (ii) Section
10.01(f) or (iii) Section 10.01(g), then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Company $39,500,000 (the " **Buyer Termination Fee** ") within two
Business Days after such termination by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more bank accounts designated by the Company, it being
understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Buyer
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Company shall provide prompt
written notice of any such breach of this Agreement by Buyer, to the extent
within the Companys knowledge, and of its intent to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01(f); _provided_ that failure to give prompt notice
shall not affect the Companys right to receive the Buyer Termination Fee
except to the extent that Buyer is materially prejudiced by such failure. No
Buyer Termination Fee shall be payable if such written notice is delivered by
the Company less than five Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(b) If paid, the Buyer Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company,
the Holders, the Stockholders Representative and each of their Affiliates and
each of their respective former, current and future representatives,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
representative, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " **Seller Related Parties** ") in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter related thereto. The Companys
right to receive the Buyer Termination Fee in the circumstances described in
Section 10.03(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the
other Seller Related Parties against Buyer, Merger Sub, the Debt Financing
Sources and their respective former, current and future Affiliates, officers,
directors, managers, employees, equityholders, managers, members, partners,
agents, representatives or assigns (collectively, but excluding Buyer, the "
**Buyer Related Parties** ") for any loss or Damage suffered as a result of
the failure of the Closing to be consummated or for any breach or failure to
perform hereunder, and neither Buyer nor any Buyer Related Party shall have
any further or other liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer against any other
Buyer Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Applicable Law,
or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement
is terminated and the Buyer Termination Fee is payable under Section 10.03(a),
this Section 10.03(b) shall not limit the ability of the Company to recover
reimbursement for costs and expenses and indemnification under Section
5.06(d). For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee,
if paid in accordance with Section 10.03(a), is intended to serve as a cap on
the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer and the Buyer Related Parties under
this Agreement, including in the event Buyer fails to effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.02 of this Agreement or otherwise breaches this
Agreement or fails to perform hereunder; _provided, further_ , that the Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Fee shall not serve as a cap on any costs and expenses and
indemnification owed under Section 5.06(d), nor shall any such reimbursement
or indemnification amounts reduce the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee.
Nothing in this Section 10.03(b) shall restrict (x) the availability to the
Company of any remedies in connection with fraud, for which all applicable
legal and equitable remedies shall be available to the Company, (y) the
Companys right to indemnification in accordance with Section 9.04 or (z) the
Companys entitlement to seek and obtain specific performance as and to the
extent permitted by Section 11.14. Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, in no event shall the Company or any Seller Related Party seek or
permit to be sought on its behalf any Damages or any other recovery or
judgment of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
from Buyer, or any Buyer Related Party other than seeking the Buyer
Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to Section 10.03(a), and Buyer shall not
be liable to the Company or any Seller Related Party for Damages in excess of
the Buyer Termination Fee. The terms of this Section 10.03(b) shall not be
deemed to be superseded, amended or modified in any respect by the terms of
any other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b), (iii) all of the conditions in
Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 were satisfied as of the Outside Date or
irrevocably waived as of the Outside Date in writing by the party entitled to
waive such condition (other than the condition described in Section 8.01(b)
and other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, provided that each of which (other than the condition described in
Section 8.01(b)) was capable of being satisfied at the Outside Date), (iv)
within the two Business Days prior to the Outside Date the Company and the
Stockholders Representative notified Buyer in writing that (A) all conditions
set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 are satisfied or waived, other than
the condition described in Section 8.01(b) and other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing and that those conditions
(other than the condition described in Section 8.01(b)) are capable of being
satisfied at Closing, and (B) subject to satisfaction of the condition
described in Section 8.01(b), they are ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing, (v) neither the Company nor the Stockholders Representative
revokes such notification, (vi) after the date hereof an Associate (as defined
by 10 C.F.R. 801.1(d)(2)) of Buyer acquires a majority equity interest in a
Person that owns, directly or indirectly, (A) any establishment with
physicians and other medical staff primarily engaged in providing surgical
services on an outpatient basis in the United States, (B) any establishment
known and licensed as a surgical hospital primarily engaged in providing
surgical procedures on an outpatient or short-term inpatient basis (i.e. not
operating as a general acute care hospital) in the United States or (C) any
general acute care hospital located in Idaho Falls, Idaho; Great Falls,
Montana; Durango, Colorado; Lubbock, Texas; Austin, Texas; or Houma,
Louisiana, and (vii) the condition to closing set forth in Section 8.01(b) was
not satisfied as a result of an acquisition described in clause (vi), then the
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company the Buyer Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 10.03(a).

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 11.03. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

 



 

Section 11.04. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party hereto, and
any purported assignment, delegation or transfer of rights or obligations
under this Agreement in violation of this provision shall be null and void _ab
initio_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may, without the consent of the
other Parties hereto, assign its rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate
or, for collateral security purposes, to Persons providing financing to Buyer
or its Affiliates, but such assignment shall not release the assigning party
from its obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.05. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York; _provided_ that the terms of the
Merger shall be governed and construed in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 11.06. _Jurisdiction_. (a) Any action, suit or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or in respect of any claim or cause of action
referred to in Section 11.05, shall be brought in any federal or state court
of competent jurisdiction located within the County of New York, and the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
such federal or state court over any such action, suit or proceeding. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such action, suit
or proceeding. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

 



 

(b) Each Seller Related Party and each of the other parties hereby agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any

 



      
 

 



 

dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction
located within New York County, New York, whether a state or federal court,
and that the provisions of Section 11.07 relating to the waiver of jury trial
shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim.

 



 

Section 11.07. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST
ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE.

 



 

Section 11.08. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns except (a) with respect to Article 2, the
Holders, (b) with respect to Section 5.10, the Persons subject to
indemnification under such Section, (c) with respect to Article 9, the
Holders, (d) with respect to Section 11.12, Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP and
Waller Lansden Dortch and Davis, LLP, (e) with respect to Sections 2.05(d),
10.03(b), 11.06(b), 11.07, 11.08 and 11.09, the Debt Financing Sources and (f)
with respect to Sections 10.03(b), 11.07 and 11.08, the Buyer Related Parties.

 



 

Section 11.09. _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement may only be brought against the entities that are expressly
named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations
set forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named
party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not
otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any party hereto shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby (for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing Sources shall not be
deemed to be parties to this Agreement and this Agreement may not be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement shall not be brought against the Debt Financing
Sources); _provided_ that, for clarity, the foregoing shall not limit the
Companys right to seek specific performance against Buyer under Section
11.14(b).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents, the Limited Guaranty, the Closing Cash Amount
Limited Guaranty, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.12. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) Buyer and Merger Sub hereby waive and agree
not to assert, and each agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
its Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising
out of or relating to the representation, after the Effective Time (the "
**Post-Closing Representation** "), of the Stockholders Representative, any
Holder or any other director, officer or employee of the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation (any such Person, a "
**Designated Person** ") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
and Waller Lansden Dortch and Davis, LLP (the " **Current Representation** ").

 



 

(b) Buyer and Merger Sub hereby agree to not assert, and each agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries
to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel referenced in Section 11.12(a) and any Designated
Person to the extent related to the Current Representation in connection with
any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Buyer, and after the Effective Time, with the Surviving Corporation or any of
the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to
control such attorney-client privilege to the extent related to the Current
Representation shall be retained by such Designated Person; _provided_ that
the foregoing acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not related to this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, or to communications with any Person other
than the Designated Persons and their advisers.

 



 

Section 11.13. _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties (or covenants) would be reasonably apparent on
its face to a reasonable person who has read that reference and such
representations and warranties (or covenants). The parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Company Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and
(ii) the disclosure by the Company of any matter in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company
that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is material.

 



 

Section 11.14. _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that, subject to Section 11.14(b), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or, in the case of the Company, the Limited
Guaranty, or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof or thereof in any of the courts provided in Section 11.06,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
in accordance with the terms hereof (including the limitations set forth in
Section 11.14(e)). The pursuit of specific enforcement by any party hereto
will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such party
may be entitled (including monetary damages) in accordance with the terms
hereof (including the limitations set forth in Section 11.14(e)), and any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, subject to the terms hereof (including the limitations
set forth in Section 11.14(e)).

 



 

(b) It is acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance with
Section 2.02 hereof if and only if (i) all of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied or irrevocably
waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, can only be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at
the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing (or the Alternative Financing, if
Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.06) has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing, (iii) Buyer fails to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing would otherwise be required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof and (iv) the Company and the Stockholders
Representative have irrevocably confirmed in writing that if such specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing will
occur.

 



 

(c) Each party further agrees that, subject to Section 11.14(b) and Section
11.14(e), it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that any
other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any

 



      
 

 



 

reason at law or in equity. No party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(d) It is acknowledged and agreed that the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance under this Section 11.14 and the payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee and other amounts payable pursuant to Section 10.03,
_provided_ that in no event shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (i) a grant of specific performance that permits the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof and (ii) the Buyer Termination Fee and any other amounts payable
pursuant to Section 10.03.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the Company, the Stockholders Representative or any Seller Related
Party have the right to seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement
(whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from any
Buyer Related Party, other than (i) the Companys right to receive the Buyer
Termination Fee in the circumstances described in Section 10.03(a), (ii) in
the case of fraud or (iii) the Companys right to indemnification in
accordance with Section 5.06(d) and Section 9.04.
