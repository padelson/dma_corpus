As a result of the Merger and at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and purposes and be 

   ##### 

  

 

liable for all of the liabilities, obligations and penalties of Merger Sub in
accordance with the NYBCL.

The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, or at such other time, date or place agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the NY Dept. of State, or at such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each common share of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Company Common Share that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is owned directly by the Company as a treasury share, or by Parent or Merger Sub, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Company Common Share that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is owned directly by any Subsidiary of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. All Company Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Common Shares. As of the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Company Common Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such Company Common Shares. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in the 

   ##### 

  

    

Merger and to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by
Section 2.1(c) (the " _Paying Agent_ "). From time to time after the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for
the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) upon
surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or
income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be turned over to Parent (such funds being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate as of the Effective Time, ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and ( _ii_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each Company Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the share transfer books of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Section 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2. 

  

 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered before the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or the provision of other satisfactory indemnity in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable taxes required to be deducted and withheld by any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date that is nine ( _9_ ) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this Section 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Common Shares formerly represented thereby in accordance with Section 2.1, but only as general unsecured creditors thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in Section 4.1(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent would, upon advice of outside counsel, violate applicable Regulatory Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.2 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit or initiate or take any other action knowingly to facilitate or encourage, any Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or ( _ii_ ) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal except to notify such Person of the existence of this provision; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a bona fide unsolicited, written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and that did not result from a breach of this Section 4.2, provided the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with fulfilling its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and subject to compliance with Sections 4.2(c) and (d), and after providing Parent advance notice of the intention to take such actions ( _A_ ) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person (and its representatives) making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement no less restrictive on such Person than the confidentiality agreement in effect between the Company and Parent (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that all such information not previously provided to Parent is provided on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to Parent, except to the extent such information would be reasonably likely to result in competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or such disclosure is prohibited by applicable Governmental Entities or pursuant to applicable laws, in each case relating to the exchange of information (" _Prohibited Information_ "), and so long as no information is provided to the Person making such Takeover Proposal that would constitute Prohibited Information with respect to such Person, and ( _B_ ) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (and its representatives) making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.2(a) by the Company. As of the date hereof, the Company has, and has caused each of its Subsidiaries and each of the Representatives to have terminated all discussions or negotiations with all third parties regarding any Takeover Proposal and requested the 

   ##### 

  

    

prompt return or destruction of all confidential information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries previously furnished to each such third
party within the last year. The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or any of its
Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, restructuring, investment, liquidation, dissolution, or
similar transaction, of ( _x_ ) assets or businesses that constitute or
represent 15% or more of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or ( _y_ ) 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common
Shares. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall ( _i_ ) withdraw, withhold or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors of the Company or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend the approval or adoption of or, propose publicly to recommend the approval or adoption of, any Takeover Proposal or withdraw its approval of the Merger, or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of the Merger (each such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation_ "), or ( _ii_ ) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a Confidentiality Agreement referred to in Section 4.2(a) or a standstill agreement with respect to the Company). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it would be inconsistent with fulfilling its fiduciary duties under applicable law for it not to do so, in response to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) that did not result from a breach of Section 4.2(a), ( _x_ ) effect an Adverse Recommendation or ( _y_ ) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) and concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement to accept the Superior Proposal; _provided_ _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 7.1(g) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects with all the provisions of this Section 4.2, including the notification provisions in this Section 4.2, and with all applicable requirements of Section 5.6(b) (including the payment of the Company Termination Fee (as defined in Section 5.6(b)); and  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) until after the fifth Business Day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal and
stating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to exercise its
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) if such Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise) at the end of such five Business Day period
(it being understood and agreed that, prior to any such termination
taking effect, any amendment to the price or any other material term of a
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
three Business Day period). The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide offer that is not subject to any due diligence condition to either
partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the transaction made by a third party in
respect of a transaction that if consummated would result in such third party
(or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company
Common Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which transaction the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) (taking into account the Person making the offer, the consideration
offered, the likelihood of consummation (including the legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the offer) as well as any other factors deemed relevant
by the Board of Directors of the Company) to be more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company than the Merger, taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such Superior
Proposal or otherwise. 

  

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall promptly (and in any case within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, any request for information that the Company has reason to believe may lead to, or that contemplates, a Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company has reason to believe may lead to any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the Person making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and any action taken or proposed to be taken by the Company in response to any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to keep Parent informed of any material developments, discussions and negotiations related to such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from ( _i_ ) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or ( _ii_ ) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders if, in the good faith judgment 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with applicable law,  _provided_ that any disclosure other than
a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company) shall be deemed to be an
"Adverse Recommendation" unless the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors (i)
expressly rejects the applicable Takeover Proposal or (ii) expressly
reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of the Merger.

The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to materiality or material adverse effect set forth therein) at and as of the Effective Time as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect. 

  

 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partyÂ’s failure to comply with its obligations under Section 5.3, subject to the limitations and restrictions set forth therein. 

  

ARTICLE VII 

   

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  

  

 Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether 

   ##### 

  

 

before or, subject to the terms hereof, after the Company Shareholder Approval
has been obtained: 

   

 (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; 

   

 (b) by either Parent or the Company: ( _i_ ) if the Merger shall not have been consummated within six (6) months of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose willful and material breach of this Agreement has been a principal reason the Merger has not been consummated by such date; and _provided_ _further_ that, in the event that all of the conditions to closing set forth in Article VI, other than the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.1(c), have been satisfied or waived within the period specified in this Section 7.1(b)(i), at the election of either Parent or the Company, such period shall be extended for an additional period of three (3) months or until the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.1(c) have been satisfied or waived, whichever occurs earlier, or ( _ii_ ) if, upon a vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefore (or at any adjournment of postponement thereof) at which the required number of shares to adopt the Agreement were present and entitled to vote and the vote to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval is taken, the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained; 

  

 (c) by written notice of either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; 

  

 (d) by Parent in the event an Adverse Recommendation has occurred or the Company has breached in any material respect any obligations contained in Section 5.1(c); 

  

 (e) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach ( _i_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b), and ( _ii_ ) has not been or is incapable of being cured by the Company within 20 Business Days after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent; _provided_ that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would not be excused by any prior breach by the Company; 

  

 (f) by the Company if Parent shall have breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach ( _i_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b), and ( _ii_ ) has not been or is incapable of being cured by Parent within 20 Business Days after its receipt of written notice thereof from the Company; _provided_ that the Company is not then in material 

   ##### 

  

    

breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement that would not be excused by any prior breach by Parent; or 

  

 (g) by the Company in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 4.2(b). 

  

 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, except that Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, may have liability or obligations set forth in Section 5.6, this Section 7.2 and Section 8; _provided_ _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for a willful and material breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of such non-breaching party under this Agreement in the case of any such breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall apply to all information and material delivered by any party hereunder, in each case in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_   _however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by law or the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders; _provided_ _further_  that any amendment to this Agreement must be approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time and to the extent legally permitted, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ _however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained or the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, there shall be made no waiver that by law or the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall 

   ##### 

  

    

any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 Section 8.4 _Interpretation_. 

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or Subsection, such reference shall be to a Section or Subsection of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, except as otherwise specified herein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. 

  

 (b) Any matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of the specific Sections or Subsections of this Agreement to which such section relates and such other Sections or Subsections of this Agreement to the extent a matter is disclosed in such a way to make its relevance to the information called for by such other Section or Subsection readily apparent. If the same item is required to be disclosed in more than one section of the Company Disclosure Letter, such item may be fully described in the principal section to which such item relates and incorporated into another section by a specific cross-reference in such other section to the section in which such item is fully described. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated 

   ##### 

  

    

hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 Section 8.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed an original document and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). 

  

 Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except that the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in accordance with its terms, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.5 (and only in that case after the Effective Time), is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto (and their respective successors and assigns) any rights or remedies. For the avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Agreement, including Section 5.8 or any other provision relating to employee benefits or compensation, shall be deemed to confer third party beneficiary rights on any Person, notwithstanding any principle of contractual interpretation that would otherwise confer such rights. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related thereto or to the transactions contemplated thereby or to the inducement of any party to enter therein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, in each case without reference to any conflict of law rules that might lead to the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. 

  

 Section 8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part (except by operation of law), by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions or other appropriate equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New York State court sitting in New York County or, if subject matter jurisdiction exists, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive in any such proceeding the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or any other security related to such equitable relief. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of any New York State court sitting in New York County or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than any New York State court sitting in New York County or, if subject matter jurisdiction exists, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (d) irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first written above.
