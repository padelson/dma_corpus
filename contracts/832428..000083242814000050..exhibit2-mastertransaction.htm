that it is advisable and in the best interests of Journal and the Journal

"Broadcast Merger", and together with the Newspaper Mergers, the "Mergers");



WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties hereto that, for United States

of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code");



WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties hereto that, for United States
federal income tax purposes, the SMI Newspaper Distribution should qualify as
tax-free under Section 355(a) of the Code to Scripps and as tax-free to SMI
under Section 361(c) of the Code;



WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties hereto that, for United States

as set forth in Section 12.01 and Section 12.02.



Section 2.02 Timing of Scripps Newspaper Distribution. On the Closing Date,
Scripps and Scripps Spinco shall consummate the Scripps Newspaper Distribution
at the Distribution Time. As used herein, "Closing Date" means the date on
which the Distributions and the Mergers become effective, which date shall be
mutually agreed by Scripps and Journal and shall be a date occurring as soon
as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of all conditions set forth in Section 2.01(e), Section 3.01(b) and
Article 12 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on
the Closing Date and will in fact be satisfied on the Closing Date).



Section 2.03 Transfer of Assets; Assumption of Liabilities.



(a) Subject to Section 2.04, as of the Distribution Time, (i) the right, title
and interest in all Scripps Newspaper Assets will be owned, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), by the Scripps Newspaper Entities and
(ii) all Scripps Newspaper Liabilities will be the obligation of the Scripps
Newspaper Entities. Prior to the Distribution Time, subject to Section 2.04,
Scripps, SMI and the Scripps Newspaper Entities shall take all such actions as
are necessary or appropriate (including executing and delivering such bills of
sale, assignments, deeds, stock powers, certificates of title and instruments
of assumption) to cause (A) the Scripps Newspaper Entities to own all of the
Scripps Newspaper Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) and (B) the Scripps Newspaper Entities to assume and be subject to all
of the Scripps Newspaper Liabilities.



(b) Subject to Section 2.04, as of the Distribution Time, (i) the right, title
and interest in all Scripps Broadcast Assets will be owned and retained by
Scripps or the Scripps Broadcast Entities and (ii) all Scripps Broadcast
Liabilities will be the obligation of Scripps or the Scripps Broadcast
Entities. Prior to the Distribution Time, subject to Section 2.04, Scripps and
its Subsidiaries shall take all such actions as are necessary or appropriate
(including executing and delivering such bills of sale, stock powers,
certificates of title and instruments of assumption) to cause (A) Scripps or
the Scripps Broadcast Entities to own all of the Scripps Broadcast Assets and
(B) Scripps or the Scripps Broadcast Entities to assume and be subject to all
of the Scripps Broadcast Liabilities.



(c) In the event that at any time or from time to time (whether prior to or
after the Closing Date) any party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries) shall
receive or otherwise possess any Asset or be liable for any Liability that is
allocated to any other party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries) pursuant to
this Article 2, subject to Section 2.04, such party shall promptly transfer or
assign, or cause to be transferred or assigned, such Asset or Liability to the
party (or its applicable Subsidiary) so entitled thereto and the party (or its
applicable Subsidiary) so entitled shall accept such Asset or assume such
Liability. Prior to any such transfer, the parties shall comply, to the extent
applicable, with Section 2.04. 

Section 2.04 Governmental Approvals; Consents.



(a) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or
assignment to the Scripps Newspaper Entities of any Scripps Newspaper Assets
or to Scripps or the Scripps Broadcast Entities of any Scripps Broadcast
Assets as contemplated by Section 2.03 would be a violation of Applicable Law
or require any Consent or Governmental Approval, then the applicable transfer
or assignment shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported
transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal
impediments are removed and/or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have
been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the procurement
of any applicable Governmental Approval, including any required FCC Consent,
any such Asset shall be deemed an Asset of the transferee for purposes of
determining whether any Liability is a Liability of the transferee.



(b) If the transfer or assignment of any Asset intended to be transferred or
assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing Date, whether
as a result of the provisions of Section 2.04(a) or for any other reason,
then, subject to the procurement of any applicable Governmental Approval,
including any required FCC Consent, the Person retaining such Asset shall
thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably
possible, of the Person entitled thereto (at the expense of the Person
entitled thereto) and the Person retaining such Asset shall take such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to whom such Asset is to
be transferred in order to place such Person, insofar as reasonably possible,
in the same position as if such Asset had been transferred as contemplated
hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion,
control and command over such Asset, inure from and after the Closing Date to
the Person to whom such Asset is to be transferred. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any
required Consent and/or Governmental Approval, the Person to whom such Asset
is to be transferred shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the
management of any Asset not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section
and the parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto.



(c) If and when the Consents and/or Governmental Approvals, the absence of
which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset pursuant to Section
2.04(a), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Asset shall be effected
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



(d) The Person retaining an Asset due to the deferral of the transfer of such
Asset shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any
money unless the necessary funds are advanced by the Person entitled to the
Asset, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and
recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the
Person entitled to such Asset.

Section 2.05 Termination of Agreements.



(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.05(b), effective as of the Closing Date,
Scripps, for itself and the Scripps Broadcast Entities, on the one hand, and
Scripps Spinco, for itself and each other Scripps Newspaper Entity, on the
other hand, hereby terminate any and all Contracts or understandings, whether
or not in writing, between or among Scripps and/or any of the Scripps
Broadcast Entities, on the one hand, and Scripps Spinco and/or any other
Scripps Newspaper Entity, on the other hand. No such terminated Contract or
understanding (including any provision thereof that purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Closing Date.
Each of Scripps and Scripps Spinco shall, at the reasonable request of any
other party hereto, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing, including having its Subsidiaries execute
such additional instruments, if any, as shall be necessary to effect the
foregoing.



(b) The provisions of Section 2.05(a) shall not apply to any of the following
Contracts or understandings (or to any of the provisions thereof):



(i) the Transaction Agreements and each other agreement or instrument
expressly contemplated by any of the Transaction Agreements to be entered into
by the parties thereto or any of their Affiliates;



(ii) any Contract or understanding listed on Section 2.05(b)(ii) of the
Scripps Disclosure Schedule;



(iii) any intercompany accounts settled in accordance with Section 9.03; and



(iv) any Contracts or understandings that any of the Contracts listed in
clause (i) or (ii) expressly contemplates will survive the Closing Date.



Section 2.06 Scripps Newspaper Distribution.



(a) At the Distribution Time, Scripps will deliver to the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of holders of record of Scripps Common Shares (other than Scripps
Common Shares held by Scripps in its treasury or shares held by any Subsidiary
of Scripps) on the Record Date, a single stock certificate, endorsed by
Scripps in blank, representing the shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock
issuable in the Scripps Newspaper Distribution (which shall constitute all of
the shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock outstanding as of the Closing Date),
and shall cause the transfer agent for the shares of Scripps Spinco Common
Stock to instruct the Exchange Agent to hold in trust (pending conversion of
such shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock into shares of Newco Common Stock
pursuant to the Scripps Newspaper Merger) the appropriate number of such
shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock (as set forth in Section 2.06(b)) for
each such holder or designated transferee or transferees of such holder.



(b) Each holder of Scripps Common Shares on the Record Date will be entitled
to receive in the Scripps Newspaper Distribution a number of shares of Scripps
Spinco Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Scripps Common Shares
held by such holder on the Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, holders of
Scripps Class A Common Shares and Scripps Common Voting Shares shall be
entitled to receive one identical class of shares of Scripps Spinco Common
Stock.

(c) Scripps and Scripps Spinco, as the case may be, will provide to the
Exchange Agent any information reasonably required in order to complete the
Scripps Newspaper Distribution on the basis specified above.

as set forth in Section 12.01 and Section 12.03.



Section 3.02 Timing of Journal Newspaper Distribution. On the Closing Date,
Journal and Journal Spinco shall consummate the Journal Newspaper Distribution
at the Distribution Time.



Section 3.03 Transfer of Assets; Assumption of Liabilities.



(a) Subject to Section 3.04, as of the Distribution Time, (i) the right, title
and interest in all Journal Newspaper Assets will be owned, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), by the Journal Newspaper Entities and
(ii) all Journal Newspaper Liabilities will be the obligation of the Journal
Newspaper Entities. Prior to the Distribution Time, subject to Section 3.04,
Journal and the Journal Newspaper Entities shall take all such actions as are
necessary or appropriate (including executing and delivering such bills of
sale, assignments, deeds, stock powers, certificates of title and instruments
of assumption) to cause (A) the Journal Newspaper Entities to own all of the
Journal Newspaper Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) and (B) the Journal Newspaper Entities to have assumed and be subject
to all of the Journal Newspaper Liabilities.



(b) Subject to Section 3.04, as of the Distribution Time, (i) the right, title
and interest in all Journal Broadcast Assets will be owned and retained by
Journal or the Journal Broadcast Entities and (ii) all Journal Broadcast
Liabilities will be the obligation of Journal or the Journal Broadcast
Entities. Prior to the Distribution Time, subject to Section 3.04, Journal and
its Subsidiaries shall take all such actions as are necessary or appropriate
(including executing and delivering such bills of sale, stock powers,
certificates of title and instruments of assumption) to cause (A) Journal or
the Journal 

Broadcast Entities to own all of the Journal Broadcast Assets and (B) Journal
or the Journal Broadcast Entities to assume and be subject to all of the

(c) In the event that at any time or from time to time (whether prior to or
after the Closing Date) any party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries) shall
receive or otherwise possess any Asset or be liable for any Liability that is
allocated to any other party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries) pursuant to
this Article 3, subject to Section 3.04, such party shall promptly transfer or
assign, or cause to be transferred or assigned, such Asset or Liability to the
party (or its applicable Subsidiary) so entitled thereto and the party (or its
applicable Subsidiary) so entitled shall accept such Asset or assume such
Liability. Prior to any such transfer, the parties shall comply, to the extent
applicable, with Section 3.04.



Section 3.04 Governmental Approvals; Consents.



(a) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or
assignment to the Journal Newspaper Entities of any Journal Newspaper Assets
or to the Journal Broadcast Entities of any Journal Broadcast Assets as
contemplated by Section 3.03 would be a violation of Applicable Law or require
any Consent or Governmental Approval, then the applicable transfer or
assignment shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported
transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal
impediments are removed and/or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have
been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the procurement
of any applicable Governmental Approval, including any required FCC Consent,
any such Asset shall be deemed an Asset of the transferee for purposes of
determining whether any Liability is a Liability of the transferee.



(b) If the transfer or assignment of any Asset intended to be transferred or
assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing Date, whether
as a result of the provisions of Section 3.04(a) or for any other reason,
then, subject to the procurement of any applicable Governmental Approval,
including any required FCC Consent, the Person retaining such Asset shall
thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably
possible, of the Person entitled thereto (at the expense of the Person
entitled thereto) and the Person retaining such Asset shall take such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to whom such Asset is to
be transferred in order to place such Person, insofar as reasonably possible,
in the same position as if such Asset had been transferred as contemplated
hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion,
control and command over such Asset, inure from and after the Closing Date to
the Person to whom such Asset is to be transferred. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any
required Consent and/or Governmental Approval, the Person to whom such Asset
is to be transferred shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the
management of any Asset not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section
3.04(b) and the parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto.

(c) If and when the Consents and/or Governmental Approvals, the absence of
which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset pursuant to Section
3.04(a), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Asset shall be effected
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



(d) The Person retaining an Asset due to the deferral of the transfer of such
Asset shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any
money unless the necessary funds are advanced by the Person entitled to the
Asset, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and
recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the
Person entitled to such Asset.

foregoing.

shares (each, a "Certificate") and each uncertificated share represented by
book-entry (each, an "Uncertificated Share") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to Section 6.03.



Section 6.02 Newspaper Mergers Exchange Procedures.



(a) At or prior to the Newspaper Merger Effective Time, Newco shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Scripps
Spinco Common Stock and Journal Spinco Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article 6, through the Exchange Agent, the shares of
Newco Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 6.01(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock and Journal Spinco Common
Stock.



(b) At the Newspaper Merger Effective Time, Newco, Scripps and Journal shall

practicable after the Newspaper Merger Effective Time, the shares of Newco
Common Stock that each holder of Scripps Spinco Common Stock as of the Record
Date and each holder of Journal Spinco Common Stock as of the Record Date is
entitled to pursuant to this Article 6. Newco shall take all necessary actions
to adopt a book-entry stock transfer and registration system for Newco

a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by Applicable

Closing of Books.



(a) At or prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Scripps shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, Scripps Class A Common
Shares in an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares of Journal Common
Stock then issued and outstanding multiplied by the Per Share Broadcast Merger
Consideration (the "Broadcast Merger Fund"). Scripps shall bear all fees of
the Exchange Agent payable on the Closing Date.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, but
in no event more than one (1) Business Day following the Broadcast Merger
Effective Time, Scripps shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Journal Common Stock that have converted into
the right to receive Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by Scripps and Journal
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per
Share Broadcast Merger Consideration.



(c) Upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by Scripps and the Exchange Agent for
delivery of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered
and Uncertificated Shares so delivered shall forthwith be canceled. Scripps
Class A Common Shares issued as Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested or is otherwise required by Applicable Law.



(d) In the event any Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered
or the Uncertificated Shares so delivered are registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment of the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration in
respect thereof that such Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly
delivered for transfer and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Scripps that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, as
contemplated by this Section 6.03, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall be deemed at all times after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender or delivery, the Per
Share Broadcast Merger Consideration plus any dividend or other distribution
declared and paid on the Scripps Class A Common Shares following the Broadcast
Merger Effective Time. Any Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration paid or
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or the delivery of any
Uncertificated Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Uncertificated Share and the
shares formerly represented thereby.



(e) At the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Journal shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Journal Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Broadcast Merger Effective Time thereafter on the records of Journal. If,
after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to Scripps or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be marked canceled ("Canceled Securities") and exchanged as provided in
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 6.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an indemnity agreement by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such Person of an indemnity bond and payment of a handling fee, all
as may be required by Scripps in its discretion or as may be required by the
Exchange Agent under the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent will be
instructed to accept such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange
for the right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration.
Delivery of such affidavit and indemnity agreement and the posting of such
bond, together with any other deliverable Scripps or the Exchange Agent may
require, shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the
relevant shares of Journal Common Stock for purposes of this Article 6.



(g) Any portion of the Broadcast Merger Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares or holders of Canceled
Securities and other eligible Persons in accordance with this Article 6 for
twelve (12) months after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time shall be
delivered to Scripps upon demand, and any such holder who 

has not previously complied with this Article 6 shall thereafter look only to
Scripps, and Scripps shall remain liable, for payment of any such holder's
claim to the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration due to such holder. Any
portion of the Broadcast Merger Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares
or holders of Canceled Securities as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of Scripps free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. None of Scripps or the Exchange Agent or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any record or beneficial
owner of any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or holders of Canceled Securities for any such Canceled Securities, or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Applicable Law.



Section 6.04 Fractional Shares.



(a) Newspaper Mergers. No fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be
distributed to holders of shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock or Journal
Spinco Common Stock in the Newspaper Mergers. All fractional shares of Newco
Common Stock that a holder of shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock or Journal
Spinco Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the
Newspaper Mergers shall be aggregated, and if a fractional share results from
such aggregation, in lieu of receiving such fractional share, a shareholder
will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent and in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 6.04(a), a cash payment representing such
shareholder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be
made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent
shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such
shareholders of the aggregate of the fractional shares of Newco Common Stock
which otherwise would have been distributed to such shareholders (the "Excess
Newco Shares"). The sale of the Excess Newco Shares by the Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE,
the NASDAQ Stock Market or other nationally recognized stock exchange in the
United States and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to such
shareholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such
shareholders. Newco shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other
reasonable out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the reasonable expenses
and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale
of the Excess Newco Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash to be paid to such shareholders in lieu of any fractional
shares of Newco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such shareholders without interest.

(b) Broadcast Merger. No fractional Scripps Class A Common Shares shall be
distributed to Journal Shareholders in the Broadcast Merger. All fractional
Scripps Class A Common Shares that a Journal Shareholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to the Broadcast Merger shall be aggregated, and
if a fractional share results from such aggregation, in lieu of receiving such
fractional share, such shareholder will be entitled to receive, from the
Exchange Agent and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.04(b),
a cash payment representing such shareholder's proportionate interest in the
net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions
(which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on
such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion)
on behalf of all such shareholders of the aggregate of the fractional Scripps
Class A Common Shares which otherwise would have been issued to such
shareholders (the "Excess Scripps Class A Common Shares"). The sale of the
Excess Scripps Class A Common Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed
in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale
or sales have been distributed to such shareholders, the Exchange Agent will
hold such proceeds in trust for such shareholders. Scripps shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other reasonable out-of-pocket transaction
costs, including the reasonable expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Scripps Class A
Common Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash to be paid to such shareholders in lieu of any fractional Scripps Class A
Common Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
shareholders without interest.



Section 6.05 Dissenting Shares (Broadcast Merger). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Journal Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time and that
are held by any Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands,
payment of the fair value of such shares of Journal Common Stock pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of
the WBCL (such Shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 6.01(b), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL (and, at the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL and any declared but unpaid
dividends having a record date prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time);
provided that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the dissenters' rights under Sections 180.1301 through
180.1331 of the 

WBCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Per Share
Broadcast Merger Consideration (without interest thereon, but including any
dividend or other distribution declared and paid on the Scripps Class A Common
Shares following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time) as provided in Section
6.01(b). Journal shall notify Scripps as promptly as reasonably practicable of
any demands received by Journal for payment of the fair value of any shares of
Journal Common Stock, and Scripps shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Journal shall not, without the prior written
consent of Scripps (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of
the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration held in the Broadcast Merger Fund
in respect of share consideration or other payments made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 6.03(a) or otherwise to pay for Dissenting
Shares shall be returned to Scripps upon demand.

Section 6.06 Withholding Rights. Each of Scripps, Journal and the Exchange
Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list for each of the Scripps
Newspaper Business and the Scripps Broadcast Business separately of all (i)
registrations or applications for registration included in the Owned Scripps
Intellectual Property and (ii) all agreements (excluding licenses for

nondiscriminatory pricing terms which have an aggregate acquisition cost of
$1,000,000 or less) to which Scripps or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound that are material to either the Scripps Newspaper Business or
the Scripps Broadcast Business and pursuant to which Scripps or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) obtains the right to use any Intellectual Property and/or (B)
grants the right to use any Intellectual Property.



(c) To the Knowledge of Scripps, the conduct of its businesses as currently
conducted does not infringe, violate or constitute a misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property of any Third Party in any material respect. Since
January 1, 2012, neither Scripps nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written claim or notice alleging any such material infringement, violation or
misappropriation, and there is no claim, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding currently pending against, or, to the Knowledge of Scripps,
threatened against Scripps or any of its Subsidiaries (i) based upon, or
challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the rights of Scripps or its
Subsidiaries in any material portion of the Scripps Intellectual Property,
(ii) alleging that the use of the Scripps Intellectual Property or any
services provided, processes used or products manufactured, used, imported,
offered for sale or sold by Scripps or its Subsidiaries do or may conflict
with, misappropriate, infringe or otherwise materially violate any
Intellectual Property of any Third Party or (iii) alleging that Scripps or any
of its Subsidiaries have materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property of any Third Party.



(d) None of the Scripps Intellectual Property has been adjudged invalid or
unenforceable in whole or part, and, to the Knowledge of Scripps, all such
Scripps Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. To the Knowledge of
Scripps, no Third Party is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of
the Scripps Intellectual Property in any material respect. 



(e) With respect to each Website, to the Knowledge of Scripps, Scripps has
taken commercially reasonable steps to: (i) maintain what it believes are
adequate computer resources to help ensure that no service outages will occur
due to insufficient data-storage, memory, server response levels or other
related reasons (except outages which are at industry acceptable levels); (ii)
protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of such Websites against
any unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or corruption, as the
case may be; (iii) obtain consent for its acquisition, storage, transfer and
use of personal information as required by Applicable Law; and (iv) put in
place policies and procedures to limit the liability of Scripps as a host of
user-generated content. To the Knowledge of Scripps, all material proprietary
Intellectual Property produced or otherwise exclusively generated by or for
Scripps, whether by assignment, work made for hire or otherwise, including any
content posted on the Websites and which material Intellectual Property is
produced solely by or for the benefit of Scripps, is owned exclusively or
validly licensed by Scripps. Scripps has taken reasonable steps to ensure that
all Persons (including current and former employees of Scripps and any
independent contractors) who create or contribute to material proprietary
Intellectual Property owned or used by Scripps in the conduct of its
businesses have assigned to Scripps in writing all of their rights therein
that did not initially vest with Scripps by operation of law.

Entities or as the owner and operator of the Journal Stations. Scripps is in
compliance with Section 310(b) of the Communications Laws and the FCC's rules
governing alien ownership. Except as set out on Section 8.14 of the Journal
Disclosure Schedule, no waiver of or exemption from any provision of the

Journal nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Journal, any
other party to any Journal Lease has (i) violated any provisions of, or
committed or failed to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of such Journal
Lease, (ii) received notice of any of the events in clause (i) above or (iii)
received notice of termination, cancellation or non-renewal of any Journal
Lease. Journal has made available to Scripps true and complete, in all
material respects, copies of all the Journal Leases, all modifications or
amendments thereto, waivers thereunder or guarantees or superior leases in
connection therewith and all subordination and non-disturbance agreements
relating thereto.

(b) Section 8.19(b) of the Journal Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list as of the date hereof of all real property owned by Journal
and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Journal Owned Properties") and a

Owned Property has good and marketable fee simple title to such Journal Owned
Property, subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens.

(d) Other than the Journal Leases, any superior leases under which Journal
Leases that are subleases are created and Permitted Liens, none of the Journal
Owned Property or, to the Knowledge of Journal, the Journal Leased Premises
are subject to any Contract granting to any Person other than Journal or its
Subsidiaries any right to the use, occupancy or enjoyment of such Journal
Owned Property or Journal Leased Premises or any part thereof.



Section 8.20 Intellectual Property.



(a) Journal or its Subsidiaries own or otherwise have the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to conduct its businesses as currently
conducted (the "Journal Intellectual Property"). There exist no restrictions
on the disclosure, use, license or transfer of the Journal Intellectual
Property owned by Journal and its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Journal
Intellectual Property").



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Journal and the
consummation of the Transactions will not encumber, impair or extinguish any
Journal Intellectual Property. Section 8.20(b) of the Journal Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list for each of the Journal
Newspaper Business and the Journal Broadcast Business separately of all (i)
registrations or applications for registration included in the Owned Journal
Intellectual Property and (ii) all agreements (excluding licenses for
commercial off the shelf computer software that are generally available on
nondiscriminatory pricing terms which have an aggregate acquisition cost of
$1,000,000 or less) to which Journal or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound that are material to either the Journal Newspaper Business or
the Journal Broadcast Business and pursuant to which Journal or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) obtains the right to use any Intellectual Property and/or (B)
grants the right to use any Intellectual Property.

(c) To the Knowledge of Journal, the conduct of its businesses as currently
conducted does not infringe, violate or constitute a misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property of any Third Party in any material respect. Since
January 1, 2012, neither Journal nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written claim or notice alleging any such material infringement, violation or
misappropriation and there is no claim, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding currently pending against, or, to the Knowledge of Journal,
threatened against Journal and its Subsidiaries (i) based upon, or challenging
or seeking to deny or restrict, the rights of Journal or its Subsidiaries in
any material portion of the Journal Intellectual Property, (ii) alleging that
the use of the Journal Intellectual Property or any services provided,
processes used or products manufactured, used, imported, offered for sale or
sold by Journal or its Subsidiaries do or may conflict with, misappropriate,
infringe or 

otherwise materially violate any Intellectual Property of any Third Party or
(iii) alleging that Journal or any of its Subsidiaries have materially
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property of
any Third Party.



(d) None of the Journal Intellectual Property has been adjudged invalid or
unenforceable in whole or part, and, to the Knowledge of Journal, all such
Journal Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. To the Knowledge of
Journal, no Third Party is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of
the Journal Intellectual Property in any material respect.



(e) With respect to each Website, to the Knowledge of Journal, Journal has
taken commercially reasonable steps to: (i) maintain what it believes are
adequate computer resources to help ensure that no service outages will occur

protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of such Websites against
any unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or corruption, as the
case may be; (iii) obtain consent for its acquisition, storage, transfer and
use of personal information as required by Applicable Law; and (iv) put in
place policies and procedures to limit the liability of Journal as a host of
user-generated content. To the Knowledge of Journal, all material proprietary
Intellectual Property produced or otherwise exclusively generated by or for
Journal, whether by assignment, work made for hire or otherwise, including any
content posted on the Websites and which material Intellectual Property is
produced solely by or for the benefit of Journal, is owned exclusively or
validly licensed by Journal. Journal has taken reasonable steps to ensure that
all Persons (including current and former employees of Journal and any
independent contractors) who create or contribute to material proprietary
Intellectual Property owned or used by Journal in the conduct of its
businesses have assigned to Journal in writing all of their rights therein
that did not initially vest with Journal by operation of law.

opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or settlement of any such
Action. No compromise or full or partial settlement of any such Action will be

conditions of the Journal Acquisition Proposal and identify the Third Party
making the same, and (2) Journal shall keep Scripps reasonably informed of any
material developments with respect to any such Journal Acquisition Proposal
and any discussions and negotiations with respect to a Journal Superior
Proposal permitted pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(i). Journal shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or similar
agreement with any Person that prohibits Journal from providing to Scripps any
of the information required to be provided to Scripps under this Section
10.02(b) within the time periods contemplated hereby.

(c) Journal shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Journal
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Journal Acquisition Proposal, and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents
or advisors) in possession of confidential information regarding Journal or
its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Journal in connection
with such activities, discussions or negotiations to promptly return or
destroy all such information. Without limiting this Section 10.02, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 10.02
by any Representative of Journal or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a
breach of this Section 10.02 by Journal.



Section 10.03 Intercompany Accounts. Except as set forth on Section 10.03 of
the Journal Disclosure Schedule or as provided for in the Tax Matters
Agreements, all intercompany accounts between Journal or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Journal Newspaper Business), on the one hand, and the Journal
Newspaper Entities, on the other hand, as of the Newspaper Merger Effective
Time shall be cancelled at the Newspaper Merger Effective Time.



Section 10.04 Newco Financing.



(a) Journal shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Newco to obtain
the Newco Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto and (ii) satisfy all
conditions to borrowing (to the extent in the control of Journal or its
Subsidiaries) included in such definitive agreements.



(b) Journal shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Scripps in
securing the Scripps Refinancing, including providing any financial or other
information reasonably requested by Scripps in connection therewith.



Section 10.05 Journal Carve-Out Financial Statements. As soon as practicable,
but in no event later than November 30, 2014, Journal shall deliver to
Scripps, the audited balance sheet as of December 29, 2013, December 30, 2012
and December 25, 2011, and the related audited statements of income and cash
flows for the years then ended for the Journal Newspaper Business and, if
required by the SEC to be included in the Registration Statements, the Journal
Broadcast Business. 

Journal shall also prepare and deliver to Scripps all interim unaudited
financial statements that the parties hereto and their advisors deem necessary
or advisable to include or that the applicable securities laws and regulations
require to be included in the Registration Statements. All such financial
statements referenced in this Section 10.05 shall comply with the applicable
rules and standards of Regulation S-X required for the inclusion of such
financial statements in the Registration Statements.

Section 10.06 Journal Shareholders' Meeting. Journal shall, in accordance with
its Organizational Documents and Applicable Law, establish a Record Date for,
duly call and give notice of, and convene and hold no later than thirty-five
(35) days following the date on which such notice is given, a meeting of the
Journal Shareholders (the "Journal Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of
seeking the Journal Shareholder Approval. Subject to the right of the Board of
Directors of Journal to make a Change in the Journal Board Recommendation in
compliance with Section 10.02(c), Journal shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to the Journal Shareholders that they give the Journal
Shareholder Approval (the "Journal Board Recommendation") and Journal shall
include the Journal Board Recommendation in the proxy statement for the
Journal Shareholders' Meeting and shall take all lawful action to solicit and
obtain the Journal Shareholder Approval. A copy of this Agreement or a summary
thereof and the dissenters' notice and attachments thereto required pursuant
to Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL shall be sent to the Journal
Shareholders with the notice of the Journal Shareholders' Meeting. If Journal
is unable to obtain a quorum of the Journal Shareholders at the Journal
Shareholders' Meeting, Journal shall adjourn or postpone the Journal
Shareholders' Meeting if necessary in order to obtain such a quorum. Journal
shall cooperate with Scripps in good faith to coordinate the timing of the
Journal Shareholders' Meeting such that it occurs on the same day that the
Scripps Family Meeting occurs. Subject to Journal's or Scripps' right to
terminate this Agreement under Article 13, Journal agrees that it has an
unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement and the Transactions to the
Journal Shareholders at the Journal Shareholders' Meeting.



Section 10.07 Stockholder Litigation. Journal will (a) promptly advise Scripps
in writing of any Action threatened, commenced or asserted against (i) it or
any of its directors, officers or Affiliates or (ii) any Journal Shareholder
of which Journal has Knowledge, in each case relating to this Agreement, the
Mergers, or any of the other Transactions, and (b) give Scripps the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or settlement of any such
Action. No compromise or full or partial settlement of any such Action will be
agreed upon without Scripps's prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 10.08 Journal Shareholder Vote. If Journal or the Board of Directors
of Journal has taken any of the actions described in Section 13.01(f)(i)-(iii)
after the First Date (a "Journal Board Action"), then Scripps may, on or prior
to 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the fifth (5th) day following the occurrence
of a Journal Board Action (the "Scripps Second Date"), deliver to Journal a
written notice explicitly (a) directing Journal to submit this Agreement and
the Transactions to the Journal Shareholders at the Journal Shareholder's
Meeting and (b) waiving any rights that Scripps may have to any payment by
Journal under Section 13.03 of this Agreement other than pursuant to Section
13.03(g). If Scripps has not delivered the foregoing notice to Journal by
11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the Scripps Second Date, then Scripps shall be
deemed to have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.01(f)(i)-(iii)
and be entitled only to the payment by Journal under Section 13.03(f). Journal
shall comply with any direction delivered to it in accordance with this
Section 10.08.



ARTICLE 11

COVENANTS OF SCRIPPS, JOURNAL AND NEWCO



Section 11.01 Reasonable Best Efforts; Governmental Approvals and Third-Party
Consents Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and Applicable Law to consummate, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including (a)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, (b) obtaining and maintaining
all Governmental Approvals and Consents that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Transactions, (c) defending against any Actions
challenging this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed and (d) executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of the Transaction Agreements; provided that the parties hereto
understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of any party hereto
shall not be deemed to include (i) entering into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions except as reasonably required to obtain the
FCC Consent or HSR Clearance, (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action,
including an action that would limit freedom of action (or otherwise agreeing
to do any of the foregoing) with respect to or ability to retain any of its or
Newco's Subsidiaries (as of immediately following the Newspaper Merger
Effective Time) or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses, assets or
properties except as provided in 

Section 8.14 of the Journal Disclosure Schedule or as reasonably required to
obtain the FCC Consent or HSR Clearance or (iii) making any monetary or other
payment in order to obtain any Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in connection with consummation of the
Transactions, no party hereto shall take any action described in clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence prior to the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of the other party, or be required to take
such action if the effectiveness of which is not conditioned on the
consummation of the Transactions hereunder. Each of the parties hereto shall
keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed of its progress in obtaining
any Governmental Approvals and Consents to be obtained pursuant to this
Section 11.01.



Section 11.02 HSR Act Filings. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, the parties hereto shall make or cause to be made any required
filings with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act, with respect to the
Transactions (including a request for early termination of the waiting period
thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received
from such agencies for additional information or documentation. Expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to
herein as the "HSR Clearance". Scripps shall pay one-half (1/2) and Journal
shall pay one-half (1/2) of any HSR Act filing fees relating to the
Transactions, except that if more than one HSR Act filing is necessary because
a party hereto has more than one ultimate parent entity, then such party shall
pay the HSR Act filing fees for any additional filings, in each case,
irrespective of whether the Transactions are consummated.

Section 11.03 FCC Filings



(a) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, the parties
hereto shall cause to be filed with the FCC one or more applications
(collectively, the "FCC Application") requesting FCC consent to the transfer
of control of the FCC Transfer Licenses from Journal to Scripps. FCC consent
to the FCC Application with respect to the FCC Transfer Licenses is referred
to herein as the "FCC Consent". The FCC Application will contain commitments
to divest and requests for waivers as set forth in Section 8.14 of the Journal
Disclosure Schedule. The parties hereto shall diligently prosecute the FCC
Application and otherwise take all actions as may be necessary to obtain the
FCC Consent as soon as possible. Scripps shall pay one-half (1/2), and Journal
shall pay one-half (1/2), of the FCC filing fees relating to the Transactions,
irrespective of whether the Transactions are consummated. Each party hereto
shall oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to
the FCC Application to the extent such petition or objection relates to such
party. No party hereto shall take any action that would, or fail to take any
action the failure of which to take would, reasonably be expected to have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the receipt of the FCC Consent.
Journal shall promptly enter into tolling, assignment and assumption or
similar agreements, if necessary, in connection with the FCC Application. If
the Closing Date shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party hereto shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Article 13, Scripps and Journal shall
jointly request extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent until
the Closing Date occurs or this Agreement is otherwise terminated; provided,
however, that no such extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of
either party hereto to exercise such party's rights under Article 13.



(b) Journal shall prosecute each application for renewal of any Primary
Journal FCC License (a "Renewal Application") that is pending on the date
hereof, and shall timely file and prosecute any Renewal Application that is
required to be filed by it prior to or on the Closing Date. For each Renewal
Application that is pending on the date hereof or that otherwise may become
eligible for grant by the FCC prior to the Closing Date, Journal shall, to the
extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant by the FCC of that Renewal
Application and thereby to facilitate grant of the FCC Application, enter into
a tolling, assignment and assumption or similar agreement with the FCC to
extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against the relevant Journal Station in connection with (i)
any pending complaints that the Journal Station aired programming that
contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement
matters against the Journal Station with respect to which the FCC may permit
Journal to enter into a tolling assignment and assumption or similar
agreement. With respect to those Journal Stations for which a Renewal
Application is pending or must be filed during the pendency of the FCC
Application, to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC
Application, but without limiting Journal's obligation set out in this Section
11.03(b) to use its reasonable best efforts to pursue the grant of any pending
Renewal Application prior to the Closing Date through a tolling or similar
agreement with the FCC, Scripps agrees, as part of the FCC Application, to
request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the transfer of control of
broadcast licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to proceed,
notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal Applications (the "FCC
Renewal Policy"). Scripps shall make such representations and agree to such
undertakings as are required to be made to invoke the FCC Renewal Policy,
including undertakings to assume, as between the parties hereto and the FCC,
the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending
Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating
to any such Renewal Application.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Scripps and
Journal each agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment
and obtain all consents under any antitrust or competition law, rule or
regulation (including the HSR Act), or any communications or broadcast law,
rule or regulation (including the Communications Act and the rules,
regulations and written 

decisions and policies of the FCC promulgated pursuant thereto), that may be
required by the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other
U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, or any applicable
non-U.S. antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, in each case having
competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting,
by consent decree, pocket consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or
otherwise, divestitures or limitations on freedom of action as are required in
order to obtain the FCC Consent or the HSR Clearance and to avoid the entry of
(or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift) any order that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 11.03(c), if any of the consents or approvals (or elimination of
impediments) contemplated by the preceding sentence have not been obtained (or
eliminated), in each case as of the date that is six (6) months following the
date hereof, and if Scripps or Journal, after consultation with Journal or
Scripps, as the case may be, determines, or, if at any time after the date
hereof, the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other
U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, or any applicable
non-U.S. antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, has indicated, that
a divestiture or other relief is required to obtain the FCC Consent (other
than the divestitures set forth at Section 8.14 of the Journal Disclosure
Schedule) or the HSR Clearance, or otherwise to remove any impediment or to
obtain any required consents under any antitrust or competition law, rule or
regulation or under the Communications Laws in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, then Scripps or Journal, as the case may be,
shall have the right to provide written notice of such determination or
indication to Journal or Scripps, as the case may be (a "Divestiture Notice").
Upon receipt of a Divestiture Notice, Journal or Scripps, as the case may be,
shall promptly (and in all respects prior to the End Date) agree to implement
or cause to be implemented such divestiture, but conditioned on consummation
of the Transactions hereunder. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt,
Scripps and Journal will take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure
that (i) no requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of FCC, the
FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or
local governmental authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or
competition governmental authority, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and
(iii) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition law or any
Communications Law would preclude consummation of the Transactions on or
before the End Date.

Section 11.04 Cooperation. In connection with their obligations pursuant to
this Article 11 with respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR
Clearance, Scripps and Journal shall (a) keep each other informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any Action by a private party, in each case with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions, (b) notify each other of all documents
filed with, submitted to or received from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement, the Scripps Stations, the Journal Stations or the
Transactions (and provide each other copies of such documents), (c) furnish
each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing or
submission hereunder and (d) reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with and in advance of any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before any Governmental Authority
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any Action initiated
by a private party. Each of Scripps and Journal (i) shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with each
other on, all information that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) shall give the other a reasonable
opportunity to attend and participate in meetings and telephone conferences
with any such Governmental Authority relating to the foregoing, to the extent
not prohibited by the Governmental Authority. With regard to any sharing of
information between the parties contemplated under this Section 11.04, (A) any
disclosure of information shall be done in a manner consistent with Applicable
Law, (B) information may be withheld as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client privilege concerns or as necessary to comply with restrictions
set forth in Contracts and (C) either party may, as it deems advisable or
necessary, reasonably designate any confidential or competitively sensitive
information as for "outside counsel only." Neither Scripps nor Journal shall
file any amendment to the FCC Application or, after grant of the FCC Consent,
request any modification of the FCC Consent without the consent of the other
party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



Section 11.05 SEC Filings.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (i) Scripps and Journal
shall jointly prepare, and Scripps shall cause to be filed with the SEC, the
applicable Registration Statement required to register under the Securities
Act the Scripps Class A Common Shares to be issued in connection with the
Broadcast Merger and (ii) Scripps and Journal shall jointly prepare and cause
to be filed with the SEC the applicable Registration Statement required to
register under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, the
Newco Common Stock to be issued and distributed in connection with the
Newspaper Mergers. Scripps and Journal shall cooperate with one another (A) in
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statements and any
amendments or supplements thereto, including by furnishing all information
concerning such party and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
the other party hereto in connection with the preparation, filing 

and distribution thereof and (B) in timely taking such actions or making such
filings, including any filings with a national securities exchange and
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the
Registration Statements.

(b) Each of Scripps and Journal shall provide the other party hereto and their
respective counsel with any comments or other communications, whether written
or oral, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statements, promptly after
receipt of those comments or other communications. Each of Scripps and Journal
and their respective counsel shall jointly participate in the response to such
comments, including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC. Scripps and Journal shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statements to become effective under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing and
to keep the Registration Statements effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Distributions and the Mergers. The Registration Statements
shall comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as applicable, including compliance with the disclosure and mailing
requirements of Schedules 14A and 14C. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statements have become effective, (i) Scripps shall mail the
joint proxy statement included in the Registration Statements to the holders
of Scripps Common Shares as of the Record Date for the Scripps Shareholders'
Meeting and (ii) Journal shall mail the joint proxy statement included in the
Registration Statements to the holders of Journal Common Stock as of the
Record Date for the Journal Shareholders' Meeting.



Section 11.06 Public Announcements. Scripps and Journal shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release, making any other public statement
or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts with respect to the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions and,
except as may be required by Applicable Law, court process or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association (in
which case the party hereto proposing to issue such press release or make such
public announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party hereto before issuing any such press release
or making any such public announcement), and except to the extent the
disclosure is consistent with prior disclosure permitted by this Section
11.06, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public
statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Transactions immediately following execution of
this Agreement shall be in the form agreed to by Scripps and Journal.



Section 11.07 Further Assurances. At and after the Newspaper Merger Effective
Time, the respective officers and directors of Scripps Spinco Surviving
Corporation and Journal Spinco Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Scripps Spinco and Journal
Spinco, as applicable, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in Scripps Spinco Surviving Corporation or Journal Spinco Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco acquired or

Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the applicable
Newspaper Merger.

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and subject to
Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Scripps and Journal

request and (iii) instruct its Representatives to cooperate with the other
party hereto in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section
11.08 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business of the other party hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 11.08(a), no Person shall be required
to provide access to information of the type described in the immediately
preceding sentence if such information constitutes proprietary customer or
supplier information or if the disclosure of such information is legally or
contractually prohibited or would result in the loss of attorney client
privilege; provided that the withholding party first uses commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner that does not
violate any such disclosure obligations or privilege. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 11.08 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party
hereto hereunder. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 11.08
shall be held by the parties hereto as Evaluation Material, as such term is
used in the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

any of such party's representations or warranties, as the case may be, or that
are material and relate to the consummation of the Transactions; and



(f) any notice of termination, cancellation or non-renewal of any Scripps
Material Contract or Journal Material Contract (or any Contract entered into
after the date hereof that would have been a Scripps Material Contract or
Journal Material Contract if such Contract had been entered into prior to the
date hereof); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 11.09 shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty made by any party hereto hereunder or limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party hereto receiving that notice.



Section 11.10 Governance of Newco. Scripps and Journal shall cause Newco to,
and Newco shall, take all actions necessary so that at the Newspaper Merger

(a) Subject to the next sentence, from and after the Closing Date, Scripps
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, solicit, induce or attempt
to induce any employees of Newco or its Affiliates to leave the employ of
Newco or such Affiliate; provided that Scripps and its Affiliates shall not be
precluded from hiring any employee of Newco or its Affiliates (i) who
initiates discussions regarding employment with Scripps, or an Affiliate of
Scripps, without any direct or indirect solicitation or inducement by Scripps
or its Affiliates, (ii) who responds to a general solicitation to the public
or a general advertising not directly aimed at employees of Newco or its
Affiliates or (iii) (A) who has been terminated from his or 

her employment by Newco or its Affiliate or (B) who has terminated his or her

years from the Closing Date with respect to employees of Newco or its

(c) If any provision contained in this Section 11.11 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 11.11, but this Section 11.11 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to be for a length of time not permitted by
Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section 11.11 to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained
herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such Applicable Law. The
parties hereto acknowledge that Newco or Scripps, as the case may be, would be
irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 11.11 and that there would be
no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Newco or Scripps. The
parties hereto agree that Newco and Scripps shall be entitled to injunctive
relief requiring specific performance by the applicable other party hereto, as
the case may be, of this Section 11.11.

Representatives at any time or from time to time. The Transition Planning
Committee shall be responsible for all aspects of transition planning from the
date hereof until the Newspaper Merger Effective Time. All decisions of the
Transition Planning Committee shall require the approval of a majority of its

(c) The Transition Planning Committee shall be responsible for recommending
those persons who will serve on the Board of Directors and as officers of

likely to cause such transactions not to so qualify; (ii) cause the SMI
Newspaper Distribution to qualify as tax-free under Section 355(a) of the Code

Newspaper Distribution to qualify as tax-free under Section 355(a) of the Code
to the Scripps Shareholders and as tax-free to Scripps under Section 361(c) of

distribution not to so qualify; (v) cause the Journal Newspaper Contribution

cause the Journal Newspaper Distribution to qualify as tax-free under Section
355(a) of the Code to the Journal Shareholders, and will not take any action
reasonably likely to cause such distribution not to so qualify; (vii) ensure

treated as "qualified property" for purposes of Section 355(c)(2) or Section
361(c)(2) of the Code; (viii) cause the Newspaper Mergers to qualify as
exchanges described in Section 351 of the Code and/or reorganizations

described in Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take any action

agree to promptly repay to Scripps the amount of any such reimbursement if it

appeal or discretionary review that such DandO Indemnified Person is not
entitled to be indemnified by Scripps in connection with such matter. In the
event that Scripps sells, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its
assets or is not a surviving corporation in any merger, consolidation or other
business combination in which it may enter with any Person, Scripps shall, as
a condition of any such transaction, cause such purchaser or such surviving
corporation, as the case may be, to assume its obligations under this Section

Indemnified Person currently covered by the officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy of Scripps on terms with respect to coverage and amount
(including with respect to the payment of attorneys' fees) no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that, if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance during such period shall exceed
300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by Scripps as of the date hereof
for such insurance, then Scripps shall provide or cause to be provided a
policy for Scripps DandO Indemnified Persons with the best coverage as shall
then be available at 300% of the rate applicable to Scripps.



(c) For six (6) years after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Scripps shall
provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time (including

and the consummation of the Transactions) covering each Journal DandO
Indemnified Person currently covered by the officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy of Journal on terms with respect to coverage and amount
(including with respect to the payment of attorneys' fees) no less 

favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided
that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance during such period
shall exceed 300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by Journal as of the
date hereof for such insurance, then Scripps shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for Journal DandO Indemnified Persons with the best coverage
as shall then be available at 300% of the rate applicable to Journal.



(d) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 11.14 shall be in addition to any rights
such DandO Indemnified Person may have under the Organizational Documents of

under any agreement of any DandO Indemnified Person with any such entity, under
ORC, the WBCL or under any other Applicable Law.



(e) The obligations of Scripps shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any DandO Indemnified Person to whom
this Section 11.14 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is
required by Applicable Law or (ii) the affected DandO Indemnified Person shall
have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being

applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 11.14).



Section 11.15 Stock Exchange Listing. Newco, Scripps and Journal shall use

Time, as insureds under any insurance policy covering Scripps and its
Subsidiaries or Journal and its Subsidiaries and (b) to cause Newco, on behalf
of itself and the Newspaper Entities after the Newspaper Merger Effective
Time, to procure such insurance coverage as determined by Scripps, Journal and
Newco, in good faith, to be necessary or advisable in connection with the

the cost of such coverage to be born solely by Newco. From and after the

Subsidiaries alleging that Newco, any of its Subsidiaries or the Newspaper

after the Newspaper Merger Effective Time, be subject to a joint privilege
between Scripps and its Subsidiaries (which include Journal and its

respective Subsidiaries shall have equal right to assert all such joint

Scripps or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Newco
or (b) Newco or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of
Scripps (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 13.04 Termination Fee in Lieu of Specific Performance.



(a) Without limiting Section 15.12 and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if Scripps breaches its obligation to consummate
the Transactions, Journal shall have the option, but not the obligation, to
(i) request Scripps to immediately pay at such time, or (ii) request Scripps
to pay after Journal shall have sought to enforce the remedy of specific
performance under Section 15.12 and such remedy for whatever reason shall have
been found not enforceable under Applicable Law with respect to such breach,
in each case an amount equal to (A) two and eighty five one hundredths percent
(2.85%) of the Journal Equity Value, plus (B) reimbursement of all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal and
other third party advisors fees and expenses) actually incurred by Journal and

connection with the Transactions; provided, however that in no case will the
aggregate amount of the fees and expenses payable by Scripps to Journal
pursuant to this Section 13.04(a) exceed four and twenty five one hundredths
percent (4.25%) of the Journal Equity Value. Any such payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Journal and shall be made within two (2) Business Days after such request.



(b) Without limiting Section 15.12, and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if Journal breaches its obligation to consummate
the Transactions, Scripps shall have the option, but not the obligation, to
(i) request Journal to immediately pay at such time, or (ii) request Journal
to pay after Scripps shall have sought to enforce the remedy of specific
performance under Section 15.12 and such remedy for whatever reason shall have
been found not enforceable under Applicable Law with respect to such breach,
in each case an amount equal to (A) two and eighty five one hundredths percent
(2.85%) of the Journal Equity Value, plus (B) reimbursement of all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal and
other third party advisors fees and expenses) actually incurred by Scripps and
its Affiliates on or prior to the date of termination of this Agreement in
connection with the Transactions; provided, however that in no case will the
aggregate amount of the fees and expenses payable by Journal to Scripps
pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) exceed four and twenty five one hundredths
percent (4.25%) of the Journal Equity Value. Any such payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Scripps and shall be made within two (2) Business Days after such request.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, as to itself, any exercise
by Scripps or Journal of its respective rights under this Section 13.04, as
the case may be, shall be such party's sole and exclusive remedy hereunder;
provided, however, that if (i) Scripps or Journal could have otherwise
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Sections 13.01(b)(iii)-(iv), Journal
could have otherwise terminated this Agreement pursuant to Sections
13.01(e)(i), (ii), or (iii), or Section 13.01(h) or (iii) Scripps could have
otherwise terminated this Agreement pursuant to Sections 13.01(f)(i), (ii), or
(iii), or Section 13.01(g), then any such Party or Parties may not seek a
remedy under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.04.



Section 13.05 Termination Fee as Liquidated Damages. The payment of any
termination fee by any party pursuant to Section 13.03 or Section 13.04 shall
constitute liquidated damages, not a penalty and shall be the sole remedy of
the payee under this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the recovery by any party of such amount is reasonable in light of the
substantial and indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.03 or Section 13.04, the difficulty
of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of
otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy and the value of the Transactions.



ARTICLE 14

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION; RELEASES



Section 14.01 Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith (and covenants herein that
have the effect of obligating a party hereto to maintain the accuracy of its
representations and warranties or to provide notice of an inaccuracy in its
representations or warranties), and any claim with respect thereto, shall not
survive the Broadcast Merger Effective Time. None of the covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement to be wholly performed prior to or on
the Closing Date, or any claim with respect thereto, shall survive the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time, and no such claim may be brought by any
Person after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, and all parties hereto shall
be released from all Liabilities thereunder, including with respect to any
breach thereof, effective as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time. The
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply
or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Broadcast Merger
Effective Time shall survive for the period provided in such covenants and
agreements, if any, or until fully performed.



Section 14.02 Indemnification.



(a) Effective from and after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Scripps
hereby indemnifies Newco, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
successors and assigns (the "Newco Indemnified Parties") against, and agrees
to hold each of them harmless from, any and all damage, loss, liability and
expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
whether involving a Third Party claim or a claim solely between the parties
hereto) ("Damages") actually incurred or suffered by such Newco Indemnified
Party arising out of, relating to or resulting from:

(i) the Scripps Broadcast Group, the Scripps Broadcast Assets, the Scripps
Broadcast Liabilities, the Journal Broadcast Group, the Journal Broadcast
Assets or the Journal Broadcast Liabilities;



(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Scripps or Journal contained
in this Agreement that survives the Broadcast Merger Effective Time pursuant
to Section 14.01; or



(iii) the complete withdrawal liability payable by Scripps to the GCIU -
Employers Retirement Fund pursuant to Section 9.10.



(b) Effective from and after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Newco hereby
indemnifies Scripps, its Subsidiaries (including, after the Broadcast Merger
Effective Time, Journal and its Subsidiaries) and their respective Affiliates
and successors and assigns (the "Scripps Indemnified Parties") against, and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by such Scripps Indemnified Parties arising out of, relating to or
resulting from:



(i) the Scripps Newspaper Group, the Scripps Newspaper Assets, the Scripps
Newspaper Liabilities, the Journal Newspaper Group, the Journal Newspaper
Assets or the Journal Newspaper Liabilities;



(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Newco contained in this
Agreement that survives the Broadcast Merger Effective Time pursuant to
Section 14.01; or



(iii) any additional withdrawal liability with respect to any mass withdrawal
of employers from the GCIU - Employers Retirement Fund payable by Newco
pursuant to Section 9.10 or any subsequent assessment of reallocation or
redetermination liability by reason of such mass withdrawal and any associated
excise tax arising under Section 4971(g) of the Code after the complete
withdrawal of Scripps from the Fund.



(c) Neither Scripps nor Newco shall be liable to any Newco Indemnified Party
or Scripps Indemnified Party, as the case may be, for any punitive,
incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including business
interruption, loss of profit or loss of future revenue.



(d) The indemnification provisions contained in (i) the Tax Matters Agreements
(and not Sections 14.02, 14.03 and 14.04) shall apply to any Damages with
respect to any Tax liability or Tax asset allocated to any Person pursuant to
the Tax Matters Agreements and (ii) the Employee Matters Agreement (and not
Sections 14.02, 14.03 and 14.04) shall apply to any obligation from and after
the Effective Time of any Person pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement.



Section 14.03 Indemnification Procedures.



(a) The party hereto seeking indemnification under Section 14.02 (the
"Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice to the party hereto against
whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any suit, Action or proceeding (each, a "Claim")
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will
provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually materially
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, exercisable
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the defense of,
at its own expense and by its own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), any matter involving the asserted
liability of the Indemnified Party ("Asserted Liabilities"), subject to the
limitations set forth herein. If the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to
compromise, settle or defend any such Asserted Liability, it shall promptly
notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
the compromise or settlement of, or defense against, any such Asserted
Liability; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any
such Asserted Liability without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
unless such settlement releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to the Asserted Liability and the settlement does not
impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding an election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding at its own expense. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of
such defense but shall pay for the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party's legal counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, if (i) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Indemnified Party has been
advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing
to prosecute or defend such claim. If the Indemnified Party shall undertake to
compromise, settle or defend any Asserted Liability in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence or after the Indemnifying Party has declined to
exercise its option to assume the defense of an Asserted Liability, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of its
intention to do so, and the Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate fully with
the Indemnified Party and its counsel in the compromise or settlement of, or
defense against, any such Asserted Liability; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Asserted Liability without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



(c) Each party hereto shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Claim by a Third Party and
shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.



Section 14.04 Calculation of Damages. Any Damages payable by an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to Section 14.02 shall be (a) reduced by any proceeds recovered
by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies, net of any costs
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such proceeds, (b) reduced by
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment paid to the Indemnified
Party by any Third Party with respect to such Damages, net of any costs
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such payment and (c) reduced by
an amount equal to any net tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party as a consequence of such Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives a
payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of
any Liability and subsequently receives insurance proceeds, then the
Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the
excess of the payment received over the amount of the payment that would have
been due if the insurance proceeds had been received, realized or recovered
before the payment was made by the Indemnifying Party.

Section 14.05 Release of Pre-Closing Date Claims.



(a) Except as provided in Section 14.05(c), effective as of the Broadcast
Merger Effective Time, Newco, for itself and each of its Subsidiaries
(including each Newspaper Entity) and their respective Affiliates, successors,
assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and employees,
hereby remises, releases and forever discharges Scripps and Journal and their
respective Subsidiaries (other than the Scripps Newspaper Entities and the
Journal Newspaper Entities, respectively), their respective Affiliates,
successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and
employees, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns, from any and all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at law or in
equity (including any right of contribution), whether arising under any
Contract, by operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any acts
or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have
failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or
before the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, whether or not known as of the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the
Transactions.



(b) Except as provided in Section 14.05(c), effective as of the Broadcast
Merger Effective Time, each of Scripps and Journal, for itself and each of its
Subsidiaries (other than any Scripps Newspaper Entity or Journal Newspaper
Entity) and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders,
directors, officers, members, agents and employees, hereby remises, releases
and forever discharges each of Newco and its Subsidiaries (including the
Scripps Newspaper Entities and Journal Newspaper Entities), their respective
Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members,
agents and employees, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns, from any and all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at
law or in equity (including any right of contribution), whether arising under
any Contract, by operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any
acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to
have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at
or before the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, whether or not known as of the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the
Transactions.



(c) Nothing contained in Sections 14.05(a) or 14.05(b) shall impair any right
of any Person to enforce this Agreement (including the indemnification rights
of each party hereto under this Article 14) or any other Transaction Agreement
or any Contracts that are specified in Sections 2.05(b) or 3.05(b) as
surviving the Closing Date, in each case in accordance with its terms. Nothing
contained in Sections 14.05(a) or 14.05(b) shall release any Person from:

(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any Contract among Scripps or
its Subsidiaries or Journal or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Newco or
its Subsidiaries (including the Scripps Newspaper Entities and the Journal
Newspaper Entities), on the other hand, that is specified in Sections 2.05(b)
or 3.05(b) as surviving the Closing Date, or any other Liability specified in
such Sections as surviving the Closing Date; or



(ii) any Liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred, assigned or
allocated to Scripps, Journal, Newco, the Scripps Newspaper Entities, the
Journal Newspaper Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
accordance with, or any other Liability of any such Person under, the
Transaction Agreements.



(d) If an Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
respect of Damages and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a
part of such Damages from a Third Party based on the underlying claim or
demand asserted against it, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of
its rights to proceed against such Third Party as are necessary to permit such
Indemnifying Party to recover from such Third Party the amount of such
payment.



Section 14.06 Exclusivity. After the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, this
Article 14 (or the Tax Matters Agreements or the Employee Matters Agreement,
as the case may be) will provide the exclusive remedy for any claims by or
against Newco or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or by or against Scripps,
Journal or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the other
hand, arising as a result of or in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (other than any remedy provided in any of the other applicable
Transaction Agreements), except that nothing herein shall limit the liability
of any party hereto for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice in writing to
the other parties hereto. All such notices, requests and other communications
shall be deemed received on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if
received prior to 5:00 p.m. on a Business Day in the place of receipt.
Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding Business Day in the place of receipt.



Section 15.03 Amendments and Waivers.



(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Newspaper Merger Effective Time or Broadcast Merger Effective Time, as the
case may be, if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party hereto against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided, however, that (a) after receipt of the Scripps
Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law
requires further approval by the shareholders of Scripps without the further
approval of such shareholders, (b) after receipt of the Journal Shareholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law requires
further approval by the shareholders of Journal without the further approval
of such shareholders, and (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this
Agreement shall require the approval of the shareholders of Scripps or the
shareholders of Journal.



(b) No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.



Section 15.04 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any
Transaction Agreement (including pursuant to Section 13.03 or 13.04), all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party hereto incurring such fee or expense. Any fees and expenses for which
Newco is responsible but that are incurred and must be paid prior to the
Newspaper Merger Effective Time shall be paid by Scripps and Journal, with
each of Scripps and Journal paying one-half of such fees and expenses.

Section 15.05 Disclosure Schedule References. Any information disclosed in any
Section of the Scripps Disclosure Schedule or the Journal Disclosure Schedule
shall qualify the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant of this Agreement and any other representation and warranty or
covenant of Scripps or Journal, as 

applicable, contained in this Agreement to the extent that the relevance of
any such disclosure to such other representation and warranty or covenant is
reasonably apparent from the content and context of such disclosure. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in any Section of the Scripps
Disclosure Schedule or the Journal Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed
to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.
Such information and any dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect"
or other similar terms in this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set
forth in the applicable Disclosure Schedules. Matters set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected therein. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature.



Section 15.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.



(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns except
that, following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, (i) each DandO Indemnified
Person is a third party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in Section
11.14, (ii) each Newco Indemnified Party and Scripps Indemnified Party is a
third party beneficiary of the indemnification provisions set forth in Article
14 and (iii) each specified beneficiary of the releases set forth in Section
14.05 is a third party beneficiary of such Section.



(b) No party hereto may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Applicable Law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of each other party hereto. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void.



Section 15.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state, except to the extent that the DGCL, ORC,
the WBCL and the Wisconsin LLC Act mandatorily apply and govern certain of the
Transactions.



Section 15.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.



Section 15.09 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to Scripps and Journal.

Section 15.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate at the
Broadcast Merger Effective Time. Unless and until the Broadcast Merger
Effective Time has occurred, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.



Section 15.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



Section 15.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of any Transaction Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and
that any non-performance or breach of any Transaction Agreement by any party
hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that
the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of any Transaction Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and of each other Transaction
Agreement in any federal or state court without posting any bond or other
undertaking, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.



Section 15.13 Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
state courts of State of New York, County of New York and of the federal
courts located in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (and the appellate courts thereof), in the event any dispute
arises out of any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction and (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court.



Section 15.14 Certain Legal Matters.



(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Baker and Hostetler LLP has represented
Scripps in connection with the Transactions. The parties hereto hereby consent
to the representation by Baker and Hostetler LLP of Scripps or any of its
Affiliates in any future matter including post-closing disputes concerning any
Transaction Agreement and all Transactions.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that Foley and Lardner LLP has represented
Journal in connection with the Transactions. The parties hereto hereby consent
to the representation by Foley and Lardner LLP of Newco or any of its Affiliates
in any future matter including post-closing disputes concerning any
Transaction Agreement and all Transactions.
