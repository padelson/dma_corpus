iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of July 20, 2016 by and among Galenica AG, a public limited company
existing under the laws of Switzerland (" _Parent_ "), Vifor Pharma USA Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and Relypsa, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Section
10.1_.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Parent
has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be
extended, amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company
Shares_ ," and each such share a " _Company Share_ "), at a price of $32.00
per Company Share (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share that
may be paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), payable to the holder
thereof in cash, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding
Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ , all upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following
the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and each Company Share that is
not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Canceled Company
Shares, the Accepted Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will
thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein
and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions contained herein, and (iii) resolved, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend that the
Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares to
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
and declared advisable this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of their respective covenants and agreements contained herein and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

1.1  _The Offer_.

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to  _Article VIII_ , as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than eleven (11)
Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement of this
Agreement), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price per
Company Share, subject to the terms of _Section 2.11_ , equal to the
Offer Price. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the Company Stockholders
and contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
_Annex A_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and thereof. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any Company Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) of:

 

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the Expiration
Time, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the
terms of the Offer a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company
Shares then owned by Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of all then
outstanding Company Shares (not including Company Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures for which the underlying Company Shares have
not yet been delivered); and

(ii) the other conditions set forth in clause (B) and clause (C) of _Annex A_
, as such conditions may be modified in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) _Waiver of Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive
any of the conditions to the Offer, and to increase the Offer Price or to
make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth herein, without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole
and absolute discretion, Merger Sub may not (and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to) (i) waive or modify the Minimum Condition or the conditions set
forth in clause (B) of _Annex A_ and clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ , or (ii)
make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes
the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer
Price or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, other than in
the manner required by _Section 2.11_ , (C) extends the Offer or the
Expiration Date, except as permitted or required by _Section 1.1(c)_ , (D)
imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex A_ , (E)
modifies the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ , or (F) amends any other
term or condition of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the Company
Stockholders.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, at the end of
the day on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the date the Offer
is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) (as such date and time may be extended, the " _Expiration Time_
"). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at the time to
which the Offer has been so extended.

 



2 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.1(c)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms:

(A) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any
Law or Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or NASDAQ, in any such case that is applicable to the Offer;

 

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex
A_ (other than the Minimum Condition) are not satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, Merger
Sub shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days each (or any longer period as may be approved in advance by
the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions to
the Offer; and

(C) in the event that all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex
A_ have been satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder), but the Minimum
Condition has not been satisfied, as of any then scheduled expiration of the
Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for an extension period of ten (10)
Business Days (or any longer period as may be approved in advance by the
Company), it being understood and agreed that Merger Sub shall not be required
to extend the Offer pursuant to this _clause (C)_ on more than two (2)
occasions, but may, in its sole discretion, elect to do so;

_provided, however_ , that the foregoing _clauses (A)_ ,  _(B)_ or _(C)_ of
this _Section 1.1(c)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of  _Article VIII_. __

(iii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner other
than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section
1.1(c)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

(iv) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to, and without the Companys
prior written consent shall not, extend the offer beyond the Termination Date.

 

(v) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , in which case Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) Business
Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

(vi) If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , prior to the acceptance for
payment of Company Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly return or cause to be returned all
tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that
are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section
1.1(c)(ii)_ ). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to pay for any and all Company Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to accept in the Offer and purchase pursuant to the Offer and this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares
if, as a result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of Company
Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid to the holder thereof in cash, less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_.

 



3 (e) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act), Merger Sub and Parent shall:

(i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, which Schedule TO shall contain
as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter of transmittal,
summary advertisement and other required or customary ancillary documents, in
each case, in respect of the Offer (together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

(ii) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to
the Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule
14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;

 

(iii) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to NASDAQ in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

(iv) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all Company Stockholders
as and to the extent required by applicable Law (including the Exchange Act).

 

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Law. Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.1_ , the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents may include a description of the determinations,
approvals and recommendations of the Company Board set forth in  _Section
3.2(b)_ that relate to the Offer. The Company shall furnish in writing to
Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub to be included in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
so as to enable Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their obligations under
this _Section 1.1(f)_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or other representatives
for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the
other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws,
or by the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel (it being
understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide any comments
thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide in writing to the Company and its counsel any and all written comments
or other communications (and shall orally describe any oral comments or other
oral communication) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
the SEC or any other Governmental Body or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after such receipt, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or any other Governmental Body or its staff (including by
providing a reasonable opportunity for the Company and its counsel to review
and comment on any such response, which comments Parent and Merger Sub shall
consider reasonably and in good faith). Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such comments.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall (i) file with the SEC, on the same day
as the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents with the SEC (which such date shall in no event be earlier than
eleven (11) Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement of
this Agreement

  



4  without the prior written consent of the Company), a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including
all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing, subject to
_Section 6.1_ , the Company Board Recommendation, the fairness opinions of the
Company Financial Advisors referenced in _Section 3.22_ and a notice of
appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) take all
steps necessary to disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the Company Stockholders
as and to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and any other applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Prior to such
filing and dissemination, the Company Board shall set the Stockholder List
Date as the record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required
by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. To the extent requested by the Company,
Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated
to the Company Stockholders together with the Offer Documents. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall furnish in writing to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required by applicable Law or
reasonably requested by the Company to be included in the Schedule 14D-9 so as
to enable the Company to comply with its obligations under this _Section
1.2(a)_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents or other representatives for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Laws, or by the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ.
Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change
and except in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with
_Section 6.1(d)_, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). The Company shall provide in writing to Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel any and all written comments or other
communications (and shall orally describe any oral comments or other oral
communication) that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after such receipt, and
unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or
in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with  _Section
6.1(d)_, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including by providing a
reasonable opportunity for Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel to review and
comment on any such response, which comments the Company shall consider
reasonably and in good faith).

 

(b) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or
shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such
assistance and such information as Parent or its agents may reasonably request

the Company, mailing labels and any available listing or computer files
containing the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of

stock depositories (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels,
listings or files of securities positions (the date of the list used to
determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are
first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ ")). Subject to applicable
Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent
and Merger Sub (and their respective agents) shall (i) hold in confidence the
information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and

extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or
control.

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Shares_. Each Company Share that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including each Company Restricted Share (subject to
_Section 2.7(g)_ ), but excluding (A) Canceled Company Shares, (B) Accepted
Company Shares and (C) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such Company Share in the manner
provided in _Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in _Section
2.10_ ).

(ii) _Excluded Company Shares_. Each Company Share (A) owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ") or
(B) irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer (" _Accepted
Company Shares_ "), shall, in each case, be canceled at the Effective Time by
virtue of the Merger without any consideration paid therefor (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, any consideration that remains
payable with respect to any such Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer).

 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the

(b) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_. 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who are entitled to demand and
who shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all respects
with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ , but instead will be entitled
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such holder
of Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, except that
all Dissenting Company Shares held by any Company Stockholder who shall have
failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262
of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner
provided in _Section 2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL in respect of Dissenting

 



7  Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(c) _Company Options_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the vesting of each Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether time-based or performance-
based, shall be accelerated in full with any performance condition being
deemed achieved at 100%, (ii) each Company Option that remains outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated as
of the Effective Time, and (iii) each holder of each such Company Option shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the Effective Time,
subject to _Section 2.8(e)_ , an amount in cash (without interest), if any,
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of
Company Shares underlying such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (y) an amount equal to (A) the Offer Price, _less_ (B)
the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay through
Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll
to the holders of Company Options who are current or former employees of the
Company the Option Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ , as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date thereafter). All other payments to holders of Company
Options who are not current or former employees shall be made through
Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiary of
Surviving Corporations accounts payable as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time (and in no event later than the next regular payroll date
thereafter).

 

(d) _Company RSU Awards_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective

based, shall be accelerated in full with any performance condition being
deemed achieved at 100%, (ii) each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated
as of the Effective Time, and (iii) each holder of each such Company RSU Award
shall be entitled to be paid by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the

interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price (the " _RSU
Consideration_ "). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay through Parents,
the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll to the
holders of Company RSU Awards who are current or former employees of the
Company the RSU Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes payable
in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ , as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in no event later than the next regular
payroll date thereafter). All other payments to holders of Company RSU Awards
who are not current or former employees shall be made through Parents, the
Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys accounts payable as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and in no event later
than the next regular payroll date thereafter).

(e) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to (i) operate the Company ESPP in accordance with its terms from
the period of time commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on its
termination, (ii) cause such offering period (or similar period) that is
underway as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP to be the
final offering period under the Company ESPP and terminate any such offering
period that might nonetheless be underway as of the Effective Time no later
than the last payroll period prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final
Exercise Date_ "), (iii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary
to reflect any such shortened offering period (or similar period), but
otherwise treat any such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Company ESPP, (iv) cause each participants shares purchase right under the
Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of any
such Final Exercise Date, and (v) terminate the Company ESPP as of the
earlier of (A) the end of the offering period (or similar period) that is
underway as of the date of this Agreement and (B) the Effective Time. The
Company shall provide timely notice of the

 



8  termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP. If
applicable, on the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date
under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding
account for each participant under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase
Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each
share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)_ , less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_. No
further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company
ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice of
the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the Company ESPP
in accordance with the Company ESPP.

(f) _Company Warrants_.

 

(i) The Company shall provide notice of this Agreement and the Merger to each
holder of a Company Warrant that is listed on _Section 2.7(f)(i)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms of such Company Warrant.
Pursuant to the terms of each such Company Warrant, each holder thereof shall
be entitled to either (a) exercise such Company Warrant pursuant to
its terms, and such exercise will be deemed effective immediately prior to
and contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, or (b) elect not to
exercise such Company Warrant, in which case such Company Warrant shall expire
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.

(ii) At the Acceptance Time, the holder of each Company Warrant listed on
_Section 2.7(f)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule that is issued, unexpired and
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each such listed Company
Warrant, a " _2016 Warrant_ ") shall, pursuant to the terms thereof and by
virtue of the consummation of the Offer and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be entitled to receive an amount in cash, if any, equal to
the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) the aggregate number of Company
Shares for which such 2016 Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time _by_ (B) an amount equal to (1) the Offer Price, _less_ (2)
the per share exercise price of such 2016 Warrant (the " _2016 Warrant
Consideration_ "). Promptly following the consummation of the Offer, the
Company shall pay the 2016 Warrant Consideration to the holders of the 2016
Warrants entitled to such payment pursuant to this _Section 2.7(f)(ii)_ in
accordance with the terms of the 2016 Warrants.

(iii) The Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to provide
for the treatment of the Company Warrants as provided herein, including by
providing any notices and taking any other actions required pursuant to the
terms of the Company Warrants.

 

(g) _Restricted Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ , with respect to
each Company Restricted Share held by a current or former Company employee
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which the
holder thereof did not timely file an election to be taxed currently under
Section 83(b) of the Code, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to the holders of such Company Restricted Shares,
the Merger Consideration (such consideration, in the aggregate, the "
_Restricted Share Wage Consideration_ "), less any applicable withholding
Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ , as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (and in no event later than the
next regular payroll date) thereafter.

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 



9 (b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , an amount of
cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which Company Stockholders are
entitled under this _Article II_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include the Option Consideration, RSU Consideration, Restricted Share Wage
Consideration or 2016 Warrant Consideration). Until disbursed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested
by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of
an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount being referred to
herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment or losses
thereon shall affect the consideration to which Company Stockholders are
entitled under this _Article II_ and to the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full
the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article II_ , Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by
this _Article II_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as provided in this Agreement.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event within three (3) Business Days, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and in each case other than any
holders of Company Restricted Shares paid pursuant to  _Section 2.7(g)_) of
(i) a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii)
non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and Parent (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Payment Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Uncertificated Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.8(e)_ ), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by  _multiplying_
(x) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such holders
transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , _by_  (y) the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ ), and the transferred Uncertificated
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent
shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
representing any Dissenting Shares) shall, from and after the Effective Time,
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_.

 



10 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, and established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Shares, Company Options, Company RSU Awards, Company Restricted Shares
and Company Warrants such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted and withheld, each such payor shall take all action as may be
necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, and such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any Company Stockholders
who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look solely to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Shares represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, as a general creditor thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares shall (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing
Dissenting Shares, which shall be subject to _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ ) cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.8_ (or, for the avoidance of doubt and without
duplication, any consideration that remains payable with respect to any
Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the Offer). The Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures,
trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to deliver Company Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options or Company RSU Awards after the Effective Time.

 



11 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Payment Agent, and the
posting by such holders of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon
such terms as may reasonably be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

2.11 _Adjustments to the Offer Price and Merger Consideration_. The Offer
Price and Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares),
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

 

2.12 _Necessary Further Actions_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agree to take all necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time without a meeting of the
Company Stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and
without limiting the generality, of the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company shall, and each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, take any
action that could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the
Merger. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to
continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the Surviving
Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under, or duty or obligation
with respect to, any of the property, rights, privileges, powers or
franchises, or any of the debts or Liabilities, of the Company as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of
this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assumptions and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable
to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under, or duty or obligation with respect
to, such property, rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any such
debts or Liabilities, in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
the intent of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ "), subject to _Section 9.11_, or (ii) other than with respect to
_Section 3.4_, as disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC after January 1, 2015, and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, but excluding any "risk
factor," "forward looking statement" or similar disclosure to the extent
predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized and existing
and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized in the
applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, with all requisite power and authority to own its properties and
conduct its business as currently conducted, except for such failures to be in
good standing or have such power that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each of its

 



12  Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation
or other entity authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in
which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the
nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified and in good standing that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of (i) each direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company and
the record ownership of all issued and outstanding capital stock or other
equity interests thereof and (ii) the percentage and type of ownership
interest thereof held by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company

(including financial and operating data and all other information relating to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by
Parent) and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise

 



28  prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (b) granting such
access would violate any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach,

right terminate or accelerate an obligations under, any Contract in effect as
of the date hereof to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or (c) access to such documents or information would reasonably be expected
to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information. In
the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance
on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or waive such a privilege.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall be conducted
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or create a reasonable risk of
damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements, and shall not include the right to perform
invasive testing without the Companys prior written consent, in its sole
discretion. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 5.1_.
Nothing in this _Section 5.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any appraisals or opinions.
No access or information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ will
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement.

_Section 5.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule, as required by applicable Law or as

delayed), during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time,
the Company will conduct and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct
its operations in all material respects according to its ordinary course of

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ , at all times during the period commencing on

its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers or other employees,
controlled Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys or other authorized

_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or 

 



31  indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or knowingly
facilitate or assist (including by way of providing information), any
proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger
Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries,
or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of
Parent or Merger Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to encourage, induce,
facilitate or assist the making, submission or announcement of any proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or offer that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 5.3(a)_, conduct, participate, maintain or engage
in, or continue to conduct, participate, maintain or engage in, any
discussions or negotiations with any Person, or take any action, with respect
to any proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle or similar document or any Contract or commitment contemplating or
otherwise providing for or relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or (v) take any action to make the
provisions of any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
(including the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL), or any anti-
takeover provision in the Companys organizational documents, inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cease all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives)
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any proposal
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company will request
that each Person or group (if any) that has executed a confidentiality
agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-public
documents and materials furnished by the Company or any of
its Representatives to such Person or group or any of its Representatives
pursuant to the terms of such confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its
Representatives may (A) participate in discussions solely for the purpose of
seeking to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or
proposal made by any Person or group solely to determine whether such inquiry
or proposal constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) inform a Person or group that has made or is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information, to engage in negotiations or discussions regarding or any
other inquiry, in each case that would reasonably be expected to relate to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of
(i) the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry (including any financing arrangements), and (iii) the identity of the
Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or group ( _provided_ that the
Company may redact, and not disclose, the identity of the Person or group
making any such Acquisition Proposal if disclosure of such identity would
violate the terms of a Contract by which the Company is bound as of the date
hereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and
timely basis (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) with respect to
any changes to the status or material terms and conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, submitted to the Company, including by providing
copies of any revised written Acquisition Proposals received by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this  _Section 5.3_
or otherwise contained in this Agreement, if after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Acceptance Time (i) the Company has received a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 5.3_, and (ii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior

 



32  Proposal and that the failure to take such action described in _clause (A)_
or _(B)_ below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company shall
substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person or
group and which was not previously provided to Parent and (y) the Company
shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person or group, or (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal (and
waive such Persons noncompliance with the provisions of any "standstill"
agreement solely to the extent necessary to permit such discussions or
negotiations). Prior to or concurrently with the Company first taking any of
the actions described in _clauses (A)_ or  _(B)_ of the immediately
preceding sentence with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of the determination of the Company Board
made pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 5.3_ by any Representative of
the Company or its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach by the Company of
this _Section 5.3_.

the financial terms (including any change to the amount or form of

promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such

duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , in the case of each of

control and lead all communications with any Governmental Body relating to
Antitrust Laws, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.3_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of
any communication from any Governmental Body regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Body relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any proceedings
initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or an Affiliate thereof
shall receive a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to which any such filings
have been made, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make,
or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.
In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent
reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Body, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all substantive meetings and conference calls
with any Governmental Body relating to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give
each other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings and
conference calls, (iii) keep the other party reasonably apprised with respect
to any oral communications with any Governmental Body regarding the Offer or
the Merger, (iv) cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications
explaining or defending the Offer and the Merger, articulating any regulatory
or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Body, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views
of the other with respect to, all written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a
Governmental Body regarding the Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each other
(or counsel of each party, as appropriate) with copies of all written
communications to or from any Governmental Body relating to the Offer or the
Merger, and (vii) cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in, and consider in good faith the views of the
other with respect to, all material deliberations with respect to all efforts
to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B)(1) of _Annex A_ and
_Section 7.1(b)_. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions
of information by one party to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis
to the extent required under applicable Law or to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other Consents not contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)_ are required
to be or should be obtained, from any Governmental Body under any
other applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish information required in
connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any such Consents that the
parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.4  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification agreements
between the Company or its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees, and any person who becomes a
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on the
date of this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement
of expenses that are no less

 



36  favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall
not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law. 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) indemnify and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and any person who becomes a director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement of
or in connection with any threatened or actual action, suit, claim,
proceeding, investigation, arbitration or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (each, an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ "), to
the extent such Indemnified Proceeding arises directly or indirectly out of
or pertains directly or indirectly to (1) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an
employee benefit plan) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to or
at the Effective Time or by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Person is
or was serving at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect
to an employee benefit plan) of another Person, or (2) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that if, at any time
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified
Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting in good faith a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 6.4(b)_, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and to the extent that indemnification with respect to
advancement of expenses is authorized under the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or any Contract, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any Indemnified
Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement,
promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses)
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such
Indemnified Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the event of any such
Indemnified Proceeding, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such
Indemnified Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified
Person, promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such
Indemnified Proceeding; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all such Indemnified Persons unless a conflict of
interest or dispute between any such Indemnified Person and the other
Indemnified Persons exists with respect to the Indemnified Proceeding, and
(iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without
his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this  _Section 6.4(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent)
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Indemnified Proceeding for
which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability
arising out of such Indemnified Proceeding.

 



37 (c) During the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person covered by the Companys currently in force directors and officers
liability insurance (" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those of
the Current Company DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying
its obligations under this  _Section 6.4(c)_, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two
hundred and seventy-five percent (275%) of the annual amount paid by the
Company for coverage during its current coverage period (such two hundred and
seventy-five percent (275%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ");
_provided_ that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for the Maximum Annual Premium.
Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company may, and at Parents request shall,
purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current Company DandO
Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
the first sentence of this _Section 6.4(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect. Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with the Company to ensure that directors and officers liability
insurance remains in effect with respect to the Indemnified Persons at all
times prior to the Effective Time, including, if necessary, by obtaining a
waiver from any applicable insurers of termination of any such directors and
officers liability insurance as a result of the occurrence of the Acceptance
Time (as opposed to the Effective Time).

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive the occurrence of
the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the written consent of such affected Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed
that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this 
_Section 6.4_.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as may
be reasonably necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in the foregoing shall require the Company
Board to take any action that would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

6.6 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including "derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the
Exchange Act)) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any director or executive officer of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.7 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not, from and after the date of this Agreement and until
the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

 



38   _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or
modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which
compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided,
in each case to any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company, unless prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the compensation committee of the
Company Board (each member of which the Company Board determined is an
"independent director" within the meaning of the applicable NASDAQ rules and
shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements
of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action)
shall have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve
as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

6.8 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the one hand,
nor Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or shall cause its
Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of NASDAQ or any other applicable stock exchange on which Parent
may be listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or
parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of
any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by the Company in compliance with _Section 6.1_. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) to the extent the
content of any press release or other announcement has been approved and made
in accordance with this _Section 6.8_ , no separate approval shall be required
in respect of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any
subsequent press release or other announcement and (b) each party
may, without complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public
statement regarding the transactions contemplated hereby in response to
questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences, and make internal announcements to employees, in each case to
the extent that such statements are consistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties or
approved by the parties, and otherwise in compliance with this _Section
6.8,_ and provided that such public statements do not reveal material non-
public information regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Acceptance Time, as applicable. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume, honor, and provide all of the Plans that provide for
severance and change in control obligations in accordance with their terms as
in effect at the Acceptance Time (including any such terms in respect of
amendment or termination of such Plans).

(b) For a period commencing at the Effective Time and continuing through
December 31, 2017, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) provide to each Continuing Employee (i) a base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunity that is
not less favorable than the base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and
annual bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits
(including severance benefits, but excluding equity-based compensation and
benefits provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension plans) that are,
taken as a whole, substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
other compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



39 (c) To the extent that a Plan or any other employee benefit plan or other
compensation or severance arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") or any employee benefit
plan or other compensation or severance arrangement of Parent is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (other than for level of benefits under any defined benefit
pension plan); _provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
(or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ")
to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision and disability benefits to any Continuing Employee,
all waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such New Plan will be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins will be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan, and (iii) the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any
New Plan that is a flexible spending plan are credited with any unused balance
in the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 6.9_
shall create such rights in any such Persons.

 

6.10 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement before and after the Effective Time, as
applicable (including, with respect to Merger Sub, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement).

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the period commencing on the
date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Acceptance
Time, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party of
(a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of the other party to effect the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement and which would reasonably be expected to result
in any condition to the obligations of the other party to effect the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 6.11_ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the

 



40  remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. The failure
to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ shall not affect any of
the conditions to the Offer or the Merger or give rise to any right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_. The terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.11_.

 

6.12 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. Subject to execution of a customary
joint defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in and consult with the Company regarding the defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation (at Parents expense), and the
Company shall not offer to settle any such litigation, nor shall any such
settlement be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

6.13 _NASDAQ De-Listing; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, provide such reasonable
cooperation in connection with any financing by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.14_ to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.14_, (i) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other Liability in
connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise require an unreasonable amount
of time from any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (iii)
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against
any and all losses or damages actually suffered or incurred by them directly
in connection with the arrangement of any such financing (other than to
the extent related to information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives).

(c) Parent and Merger Sub will not amend or waive any provision of the Credit
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) to the extent such
amendment or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the financing
contemplated by the Credit Agreement or (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise modifies any of the conditions to the
receipt of the financing contemplated by the Credit Agreement or other terms
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent the Closing or
delay the Closing beyond the initial Expiration Time or (y) make the timely
funding of the financing contemplated by the Credit Agreement or satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the financing contemplated by the Credit
Agreement less likely to occur by the initial Expiration Time. Parent and
Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing on the
terms set forth in the Credit Agreement and to consummate such financing or
an equivalent financing at or prior to the Closing.

termination to the other party or parties hereto and that any termination by
Parent also shall be an effective termination by Merger Sub):

Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party hereto
whose material breach of its obligations under this Agreement has been the

of such Restraint; or

(d) by the Company, in the event that Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached
or failed to perform any of their respective covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, or any of the representations and warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have been or become inaccurate,
which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, individually or in the
aggregate with other such breaches, failures to perform or inaccuracies, would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), and such breach, failure to perform or
inaccuracy is not capable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30)
days following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such
breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy; _provided_ that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

such that Parent has the right (or would have the right following notice and
an opportunity to cure, if applicable) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_; or

 



42 (e) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company shall have breached or failed
to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or any of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have been or become inaccurate, in either case such that the conditions
to the Offer set forth in clauses (C)(2) or (C)(3) of _Annex A_ would fail to
be satisfied, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is not capable
of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30) days following Parents
delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach, failure to perform
or inaccuracy, or (ii) there has been a Material Adverse Effect such that the
condition to the Offer set forth in clause (C)(4) of _Annex A_ would fail to
be satisfied; _provided_ , in each case, that Parent shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder such that the Company has the
right (or would have the right following notice and an opportunity to cure, if
applicable) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_; or

 

(f) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a

5.3_, (ii) the Company Board shall have determined to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_, and (iii) the

liability of any party or parties hereto (or any director, officer, employee,

terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (b) that, except as set forth in _Section
8.3(d)_ , nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto from any
liability or damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement that occurs prior to such termination (which liability or damages
the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and may include, to the extent proven and
awarded by the court, damages based on loss of the economic benefit of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Companys stockholders, it
being acknowledged that the stockholders of the Company shall not have the
right to assert directly any claim against Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise
enforce this Agreement).

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is
consummated.

 



43 (b) _Termination Fee_. The Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
$49,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent:

 

(i) within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, in the event that (A)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_ and the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied prior to such
termination ( _provided_ , that (x) the conditions to the Offer set forth in
clause (B) and clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ are satisfied at the time of such
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ , and (y) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ is then available to Parent), (B)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such
termination of this Agreement, a Competing Acquisition Transaction (as defined
below) shall have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly
disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been withdrawn or otherwise
abandoned, and (C) within nine (9) months following such termination of this
Agreement, either (y) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Competing Acquisition Transaction or (z) a Competing Acquisition
Transaction is consummated. For purposes of the foregoing, a " _Competing
Acquisition Transaction_ " shall have the same meaning as an "Acquisition
Transaction" except that all references therein to "more than twenty
percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "more than fifty percent
(50%)."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ , as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_ , within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent
following such termination.

 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one (1) occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 

(d) _Termination Fee as Liquidated Damages_. The parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in _Section 8.3(b)_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. The payment by the Company of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and, to the extent applicable, any amounts
payable under _Section 8.3(e)_ , shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub in the event of termination of this Agreement under
circumstances requiring the payment of a Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee (and, to the extent applicable, any amounts payable under
_Section 8.3(e))_ , the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof or any
matter forming the basis for such termination), including the Offer and the
Merger, and in such case neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal
Proceeding or make any claim against the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

 

(e) _Consequences of Non-Payment_. If the Company fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime
lending rate prevailing as published in The Wall Street Journal for the period
from the date such Termination Fee was initially due to the date of payment.

 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section 2.8(d)_ , all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

 



44 8.4 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided that following the Acceptance Time, this Agreement
may not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger Consideration to
differ from the Offer Price. This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of all of the parties.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
or parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any schedules, annexes and
exhibits hereto) and the documents and instruments and other agreements among
the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the
Disclosure Schedule and the Annexes hereto, constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided, however_ _,_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT,
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
NEITHER PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER
HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
(INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE
(OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT
TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

9.4 _Assignment_. No party may assign (by merger, operation of Law or
otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties;
_provided, however_ , that Parent or Merger Sub may assign its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder (a) to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary or (b) as a collateral assignment to Parents or Merger Subs
lenders, but in no event shall any such assignment relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of any of its obligations hereunder; _provided, further_ , that any
assignment pursuant to _clause (a)_ or _clause (b)_ of this _Section 9.4_
that would increase the amount, if any, required to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ from amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
(as compared to the amount that would have been required to be deducted or
withheld had there been no such assignment) shall be null and void unless
Parent, Merger Sub and the applicable assignee specifically agree in writing
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause the Paying
Agent to,

 



46  pay to the applicable payee such additional amounts as necessary to ensure
that such payee receives the same amount that would otherwise have been
received if no such assignment had been made. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void ab
initio.

9.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and
provisions of _Section 6.4_ , (b) the right of the Company, subject to
_Section 8.2_ , to pursue damages (including to the extent proven and awarded
by the court, damages based on loss of the economic benefit of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Companys
stockholders, it being acknowledged that the stockholders of the Company shall
not have the right to assert directly any claim against Parent or Merger Sub
or otherwise enforce this Agreement), (c) from and after the Acceptance Time,
the rights of the holders of Company Shares accepted for payment in the offer
to receive the Offer Price, as provided in _Article I_ and in accordance with
the Offer, and (d) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of Company
Stockholders and the holders of other Company Securities to receive the Merger
Consideration, as provided and to the extent set forth in _Article II_.

 

9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating
to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any term or other provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer and the
Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer
and the Merger be effected as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, including _Section 8.3(d)_ , any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled (without proof of
actual damages or otherwise or posting or securing any bond) to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain

 



47  breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or
parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in

Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in

applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 9.9_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law, (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction
over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested
exclusively in the Federal Courts of the United States of America, the Federal
Court of the United States of America sitting in the District of Delaware,
as applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof (the " _Chosen
Courts_ ")) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (c) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (d) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen
Courts, (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the

or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same, and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other
than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided

on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

9.11 _Disclosure Schedule References_. The parties hereto agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this _clause (b)_
only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants,
as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of

 



48  the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed
