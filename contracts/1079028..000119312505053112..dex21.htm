income tax returns. If Seller and Buyer shall have agreed on a Purchase Price
allocation and an Asset Acquisition Statement, then Seller and Buyer shall
file the Asset Acquisition Statement in the form so agreed and neither Seller
nor Buyer shall take a Tax position which is inconsistent with such Purchase
Price allocation.



2.11 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing, upon the reasonable
request of a Party, the other Party shall prepare, execute and deliver
such other and further agreements, instruments, certificates, and other
documents, and take, do and perform such other and further actions, as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the purposes and
intent of this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. In this regard, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances and such other
instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to transfer and deliver to Buyer and its affiliates
and their successors and assigns, all of the properties, rights,
titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be
conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement, and to assure the assumption by Buyer
from Seller and its affiliates and their successors and assigns of the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Buyer under this
Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby (including returning to Seller any asset not contemplated by this
Agreement to be a Business Asset, which asset was delivered to Buyer at the
Closing).



2.12 _Non-Assignable Assets_. 



(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Business Contract, agreement, asset, property or right, including any
certificate, approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by
Law is nonassignable without the consent of a third party or a Governmental
Entity or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment (each a
" _Non-Assignable Asset_ " and collectively, the " _Non-Assignable Assets_ ")
unless and until such consent shall have been obtained.



(b) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents
prior to the Closing; _however,_ Seller shall not be required to pay any fee
or make any payment to any third party in order to obtain any such consent,
and Buyer understands and agrees that the procurement of any such consent is
not a condition to Buyers obligation to effect the Closing.



 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent,
substitution, approval, or amendment required to novate all obligations under
any and all Business Contracts or other obligations or liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of Seller and its affiliates so that, in any such case, Buyer and its
affiliates shall, effective as of the Closing, be solely responsible for the
liabilities and obligations underlying the Assumed Liabilities.



 

-19- (d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event that written
consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained prior to the Closing,
such Non-Assignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by
Seller in trust for Buyer and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall
be performed by Buyer in Sellers name and all benefits and obligations
existing thereunder shall be for Buyers account. Seller shall take or cause
to be taken at Buyers expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer
may reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the benefits of the Non-
Assignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Non-Assignable Assets, and Seller shall
promptly pay over to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it in
respect of all Non-Assignable Assets.



(e) As of and from the Closing Date, Seller on behalf of itself and its
affiliates authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of the Non-Assignable Assets, at Buyers expense, to perform all the
obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller or its affiliates under
the Non-Assignable Assets.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until any written consent or approval with respect to any Non-Assignable Asset
is obtained, such Non-Assignable Asset shall not constitute a Business Asset
and any associated liability shall not constitute an Assumed Liability for
any purpose under this Agreement, and the failure of any such written consent
or approval to be obtained or the failure of any such Non-Assignable Asset to
constitute a Business Asset or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or a breach by Seller
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.



(g) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be
obtained, (i) any remaining consents necessary to assign to Buyer any Non-
Assignable Assets, and (ii) any remaining consent, substitution, approval, or
amendment required to novate all Assumed Liabilities underlying such Non-
Assignable Assets, or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of Seller
and its affiliates so that, in any such case, Buyer and its affiliates shall
be solely responsible for such Assumed Liabilities. 



(h) Within 30 days after the Closing, Buyer shall complete an internal audit
to determine any infringing uses of Software by Seller in the operation of the
Business at the Premises as of the date hereof. To the extent any such
infringing uses are determined by such audit, Seller shall promptly provide
such necessary licenses for such Software at Sellers expense. In the event
that Seller disputes the results of Buyers internal audit, Seller and Buyer
shall promptly engage an independent third party to resolve any disputes, and
the expenses of such third party shall be split evenly by Buyer and Seller.



(i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate
with Buyer in obtaining any required consents to assign Business License
Agreements. In particular, on or before the date that occurs two (2) days
following the Closing, Seller shall prepare and send out letters requesting
such required consents. Seller shall bear the expense of requesting such
consents.



 

-20- 2.13 _Bulk Sales Law_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction
that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the
Business Assets to Buyer.



2.14 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller shall each pay fifty percent
(50%) of all applicable sales and transfer Taxes (or any similar Taxes) and
all recording and filing fees that may be imposed, assessed or payable by
reason of the operation or as a result of this Agreement including the sales,
transfers, leases, rentals, licenses, and assignments contemplated hereby,
but shall not pay Sellers net income and capital gains taxes or franchise or
other taxes based on Sellers net income, gross receipts or profits (or other
similar Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by Law, to reduce any
applicable Transfer Taxes. Such cooperation shall include (i) the delivery of
appropriate resale certificates by Buyer, (ii) the Parties obtaining
applicable exemption certificates, and (iii) Seller transferring certain
Intellectual Property to Buyer by remote electronic transmission or other
reasonable means of transferring Business Intellectual Property capable of
being so transferred in other than tangible form.



2.15 _Intercompany Accounts_. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller will
cancel all of its intercompany payables to the Business arising on or prior to
the Closing Date. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller will cancel all
intercompany receivables of the Business owed to Seller, and Buyer shall not
have any responsibility for payment of such liabilities. In no event shall
this provision affect any of the Parties rights, duties and obligations in,
to and under any of the Ancillary Agreements. 



2.16 _Excess and Obsolete Inventory_. To the extent Buyer determines it is
necessary under its then existing accounting policies to, on or prior to
August 31, 2005, write-off any Inventory included within the Business Assets
and identified as potentially excess and obsolete based on a schedule to
be delivered by Buyer to Seller within three (3) business days following the
Closing Date (identifying the excess and obsolete Inventory included within
the Business Assets as of the Closing Date) prepared based on the practices,
principles and methodologies used by Seller to prepare _Schedule 2.16_
attached hereto, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a certificate signed by a duly
authorized officer of Buyer: (i) setting forth the amount of the specific
Inventory determined necessary to be written-off in accordance with Buyers
then existing accounting policies (the " _E andO Losses_"), and (ii) certifying
that all such Inventory has been disposed of and will not be used for any
purpose, or sold or otherwise distributed for consideration, by or on behalf
of Buyer or any of its affiliates (the " _E andO Certificate_"). In the event
Seller does not object to all or any portion of the EandO Losses set forth on
the EandO Certificate, Seller shall promptly pay Buyer an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the amount by which the EandO Losses exceed (x) the aggregate
amount of excess and obsolete inventory reserves as of the Closing Date and
set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement (" _E andO Reserves_") and
(y) to the extent that the EandO Losses relate to Inventory identified to a
customer from whom cash deposits have been collected and are recorded by the
Seller on the Closing Date, such cash deposit amount on the Closing Date. In
the event Seller objects to all or any portion of the EandO Losses set forth in
the EandO Certificate within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the EandO
Certificate, the Parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve the



 

-21- dispute; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding the existence of any dispute,
Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer any undisputed amounts payable pursuant to
this _Section 2.16_. If within thirty (30) days of Sellers objection to all
or any portion of the EandO Losses set forth on the EandO Certificate, the Parties
are unable to resolve the dispute, the dispute shall be resolved exclusively
by binding arbitration pursuant to _Section 7.10_.

be an Excluded Liability. Buyer shall have responsibility for workers
compensation claims relating to Transferred Employees and arising out of

itself out as Seller or an affiliate of Seller.



5.10 _Non-Exclusive License of Proprietary Software_. Effective at the
Closing, and without any further action by the Parties hereto, Seller
retains, and Buyer hereby grants to Seller (including its successors and
assigns) a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up,

the Proprietary Software. Seller shall retain a copy of the Proprietary
Software, or Buyer shall deliver after the Closing, at Sellers request, the
Proprietary Software to Seller. For purposes of this _Section 5.10_ , "
_Proprietary Software_ " means the Intellectual Property described on
_Schedule 5.10_ hereto.



5.11 _Non-Exclusive Cross-License_.



(a) Seller grants to Buyer, effective upon Closing, a nonexclusive,
worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up, royalty-free license, under

whatsoever and reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, digitally
transmit, display and publicly perform tangible manifestations of the
Business-Owned Intellectual Property, and to confidentially disclose such

5.13  _Environmental Covenants_.



(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that as part of its ongoing Hazardous
Materials management practices, Seller conducted lead wipe sampling at the
Real Property in November 2004 to determine the levels of lead dust then
existing. As a result of such testing, Seller thereafter cleaned the sampled
areas that showed concentrations of lead dust at the Real Property in
accordance with accepted industry practice and re-sampled those areas that
showed higher concentrations at the Owned Real Property and Leased
Real Property at Poway. As a result of such re-sampling, Seller and Buyer
have agreed that prior to the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall re-clean the
areas where samples were taken at the Owned Real Property at T-16 and T-2 as
shown on the Tempe Facility Lead Wipe Sampling Report prepared by MWH
Americas, Inc. dated December 16, 2004 in accordance with accepted industry
practice and then (ii) Seller shall resample such areas and provide the
results to Buyer.



(b) Buyer acknowledges that Seller has retained certain liabilities
under this Agreement for Soil and Groundwater Remedial Actions (including,
without limitation, the Superfund Liabilities). As such, Buyer agrees that it
shall not undertake any Voluntary Remedial Action that is a Soil and
Groundwater Remedial Action without Sellers prior written consent, which may
be granted or withheld in Sellers sole discretion.



(c) Seller agrees to pay any fines or penalties assessed by any Governmental
Entity resulting from Sellers failure to have the Industrial

of Claim in accordance with _Section 7.4_ , or, in the event of a Third-Party
Claim, given notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim in
accordance with _Section 7.5_ , in each case on or prior to the End Date.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other Party and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,

-45- liabilities, obligations, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs and
other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
the foregoing) incurred or paid (collectively, " _Losses_ ") by any
Indemnified Party to the extent that the Losses arise by reason of, or result
from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the other Party
contained in this Agreement (provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to
any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
_Section 3.24_ (Product Liabilities)), (ii) the breach by the other Party of
any covenant or agreement of such Party contained in this Agreement (except in

(b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and

_Section 7.2(b)_ with respect to Excluded Liabilities shall not be subject to

Buyers offer of employment in accordance with _Section 5.8(a)_  hereof.
Buyers obligations under this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall not be subject to any of
the limitations set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_.

(each a " _Claim_ ") made under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ of this _Article VII_

shall have no liability for any individual Claim until the amount of the Loss
finally determined to have been incurred or paid equals or exceeds $25,000
(each, a " _Qualified Loss_ ") (it being understood that any one or more
Claims arising from the same set of facts and circumstances may be aggregated
for purposes of determining a Qualified Loss), and (y) the Indemnifying Party
shall have no liability for any Claims until the aggregate amount of the
Qualified Losses finally determined to have been incurred or paid shall exceed
$2,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable only for the portion of the Qualified Losses exceeding
the Deductible Amount, and (z) the Indemnifying Partys aggregate



 

-46- liability for all such Losses shall not exceed $48,750,000 (the " _Indemnity
Cap_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in this
_Section 7.3(a)_ shall not apply to Losses attributable to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.2_ (Authorization of
Transaction) and the first sentence of _Section 3.9_ (Title to Assets).



(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
amount of the Indemnifying Partys liability under this Agreement shall be net
of any insurance proceeds or other third party indemnity or
contribution amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified Party. Each
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any
such insurance proceeds or other third party indemnity or contribution amounts
recoverable by such Indemnified Party, and in the event any such amounts are
collected after a Claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse such amounts to such Indemnifying
Party. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its
damages.



(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Party shall be liable to the other Party for any indirect, special, punitive,
exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss of revenue or
profit) arising out of this Agreement, _provided, however,_ that the
foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party
in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims.



7.4 _Procedures for Indemnification_.



(a) In the event an Indemnified Party shall have a Claim for Losses under this
_Article VII_ , Buyer or Seller (on behalf of itself or its affiliates), as
the case may be, shall promptly send written notice of such Claim (the "
_Notice of Claim_ ") to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice must (i) state the
amount of Losses incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party to the extent
reasonably known at the time of the Notice of Claim, (ii) specify in
reasonable detail to the extent reasonably known at the time of the Notice of
Claim the individual items of Losses included in the amount stated, the date
each such item was incurred or paid, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such Loss is related (including
specific references to the applicable representation or covenant), and (iii)
be executed by a duly authorized officer of Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be.



(b) The Indemnifying Party may make a written objection (" _Objection_ ") to
any Claim for indemnification delivered pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_. The
Objection shall be delivered to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after
delivery of the Notice of Claim.



(c) In the event of a dispute that the Parties are able to resolve, the
Parties shall prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement, and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by such Indemnified
Party the agreed-upon amount of the Loss (if any) within five days of the date
of such written memorandum.



(d) If, within thirty (30) days of delivery of the notice of Objection (as
such period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Parties), the
Parties are unable to resolve a dispute over the Claim for indemnification to
which the Objection has been made, the dispute shall be resolved exclusively
by binding arbitration, pursuant to _Section 7.10_.

 



 

-47- 7.5 _Third Party Claims_.



(a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days of becoming aware of
a Third-Party Claim) notify the Party against whom indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by any third party, in respect
of which indemnity may be sought by the Indemnified Party under this _Article
VII_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") and shall give the Indemnifying Party such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request, but failure to give timely notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by such failure, and except as
provided in _Section 7.1_ ).



(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation,
exercisable in its sole discretion by written notice to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the
commencement of or assertion of any Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense
and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section
7.5(b)_. The non-controlling Party shall have the right to participate in (but
not control), at its own expense, the defense and settlement of any Third-
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to undertake and conduct
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall undertake the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.



(c) In the event the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement or
judgment relates solely to monetary damages and provides for a complete
release of the Indemnified Party, in which case, no such consent shall be
required. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, or consent to
the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim for which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense.



 

(d) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or prosecute any
Third-Party Claim, both Parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or
as provided in _Section 5.4_.



7.6 _Product Warranties and Liabilities_. In the event aggregate Losses
attributable to the Product Warranties and Liabilities assumed by Buyer
hereunder exceed the aggregate reserves therefor set forth on the Closing
Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall from time-to-time deliver to Seller
a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of Buyer: (i) setting forth
the amount by which the aggregate Losses attributable to the Product
Warranties and Liabilities as of the date of the Product Certificate (less any
amounts previously paid by Seller to Buyer as a result of its obligations



 

-48- under _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ and this _Section 7.6_ ) exceed the sum of (x) the
aggregate reserves for Product Warranties and Liabilities set forth on the
Closing Working Capital Statement (to the extent not previously taken into
account in calculating a Product Loss hereunder pursuant to a prior Product
Certificate) plus (y) the aggregate insurance proceeds actually recovered for
any such Losses by the Indemnified Party (to the extent not previously taken
into account in calculating a Product Loss hereunder pursuant to a prior
Product Certificate) (the " _Product Losses_ "), and (ii) certifying that
Buyer has properly incurred or paid such Product Losses (the " _Product
Certificate_ "). Upon Sellers receipt of a Product Certificate, subject to
the provisions of this _Article VII_ , Seller shall be obligated to indemnify
Buyer and the Indemnified Parties of Buyer for an amount equal to fifty-
percent (50%) of any such Product Losses set forth on such Product Certificate
(such amount the "Losses" for purposes of this _Article VII_ ; _provided,
however,_ that such Losses shall not be included in calculating, or subject
to, the Deductible Amount); _provided, further, however_ , in the event it is
finally determined that Product Losses exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate,
Seller shall, subject to the provisions of this _Article VII_ , be obligated
to indemnify Buyer and the Indemnified Parties of Buyer for an amount equal to
one-hundred percent (100%) of all Product Losses in excess of
$5,000,000. Sellers obligations under this _Section 7.6_ shall not be
subject to any of the limitations set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.3(a)_.



 

7.7 _Additional Provisions Regarding Claims With Respect to Soil and
Groundwater Remedial Actions_.



(a) _Seller Control of Claims_. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to
the following with respect to any claims with respect to Soil and Groundwater
Remedial Actions that are subject to indemnity by Seller pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ hereof:



(i) Buyer shall provide notice to Seller of such claim in the manner required
in this _Article VII_ prior to undertaking any Soil or Groundwater Remedial
Actions (" _Buyer s Remedial Action Notice_").



(ii) Seller shall, no later than ten (10) days following receipt of Buyers
Remedial Action Notice, deliver notice to Buyer indicating whether Seller
shall assume responsibility for the Remedial Actions identified in the Buyers
Remedial Action notice. In the event Seller does not provide timely notice to
Buyer, Buyer shall have the right to perform the Remedial Actions identified
in the Buyers Remedial Action Notice.



(b) _Seller Obligations with Respect to Soil and Groundwater Remedial
Actions_. In the event Seller undertakes the Soil and Groundwater Remedial
Actions, Seller shall covenant the following to Buyer:



(i) Seller shall perform the Soil and Groundwater Remedial Actions
in compliance with all Environmental Laws and within the time frames required
by Environmental Laws and the relevant Governmental Entity.



(ii) Seller shall protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer,
Buyers affiliates and any other owner or occupant of the relevant Real
Property from and against any



 

-49- claims to the extent arising at any time out of, relating to, or resulting
from (i) the negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its agents,
employees, consultants or contractors in connection with the Soil and
Groundwater Remedial Actions, and (ii) any other injury or damage caused by
Seller or its agents, employees, consultants or contractors in connection
with the Soil and Groundwater Remedial Actions.



(iii) Seller shall provide to Buyer in a timely fashion, (i) a copy of any
documents to be submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding any Soil and
Groundwater Remedial Actions performed or to be performed by or on behalf of
Seller; (ii) a copy of documents submitted to or received from any
Governmental Entity regarding any Soil and Groundwater Remedial Actions
performed or to be performed by or on behalf of Seller, and (iii) analytical
results of any environmental sampling conducted on relevant Real Property by
or on behalf of Seller under this Agreement.



(c)  _Buyer s Obligations Regarding Access_. In the event Seller undertakes
Soil and Groundwater Remedial Actions as required herein, Buyer shall provide
Seller reasonable access to the Real Property, to the extent Buyer has the
right to do so, for Seller to perform such activities, and Seller and Buyer
shall execute a mutually acceptable and commercially reasonable access
agreement to address notice for access, access timing, non-interference with
operations on the Real Property, restoration (at Sellers cost) of the Real
Property to its pre-access appearance and insurance.



(d) _Limitation on Environmental Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the limitations set forth in clauses _(x)_  and
_(y)_ of _Section 7.3(a)_ hereof shall not apply to the Soil and Groundwater
Remedial Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including in this _Article VII_ , in no event shall Seller be required

whose breach of this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in
