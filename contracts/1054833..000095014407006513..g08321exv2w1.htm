 Section 2.2 _Base Purchase Price_.The base purchase price for all of the Membership Interest purchased by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ") shall be the aggregate sum of $685,000,000.00. The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to pre-closing and 

    ##### 

 

  

closing adjustments as provided in _Section 2.4_ and to post-
closing adjustments as provided in _Section 2.5_. The Base Purchase Price,
as so adjusted by the pre-closing and closing adjustments, shall be payable
as provided in _Section 3.2_, and the post-closing adjustments to the Base
Purchase Price shall be payable as provided in _Section 2.5(c)_. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Closing Financial Information_. 

  

 (a) _Closing Balance Sheets_. Not less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days before the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall prepare in good faith estimated balance sheets of the Company and the Regulated Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in the forms attached hereto as _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter (each a " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ," and together the " _Closing Balance Sheets_ "). If the anticipated Closing Date changes for any reason such that the delivered Closing Balance Sheet was prepared more than ten (10) days before the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and provide to Buyer new Closing Balance Sheets prior to the actual Closing Date. Except as set forth below or specified elsewhere in this Agreement, the estimated and final Closing Balance Sheet for the Company shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP with consideration of the accounting principles, policies, practices, judgments and methodologies, including with respect to determining estimates and allowances, used in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Entities Balance Sheet and the estimated and final Closing Balance Sheet for each of the Regulated Subsidiaries shall be prepared in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles with consideration of the accounting principles, policies, practices, judgments and methodologies, including with respect to determining estimates and allowances, used in connection with the preparation of the statutory balance sheets included in the State Regulatory Filings. To the extent applicable: 

    

 (i) The Closing Balance Sheets shall take into account (A) the termination of the Terminating Contracts at Closing and all payments due in connection therewith pursuant to  _Section 7.7_ of this Agreement and (B) the payments at Closing pursuant to  _Sections 3.2(b)(ii)_, _3.2(b)(iii)_ , _3.2(b)(iv)_ and _3.2(b)(v)_. 

   

 (ii) No amount shall be reflected on the Closing Balance Sheets with respect to letters of credit, guarantees, goodwill or deferred tax assets for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (iii) Subject to clause (i) above, the Closing Balance Sheets shall include an accrual for the estimated pro rata bonuses earned as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (iv) The Closing Balance Sheets shall include an accrual for the settlement of all obligations under the Companys defined benefit pension plan. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Pre-Closing and Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_. 

  

 If the Regulated Subsidiaries Statutory Net Worth as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheets (the " _Closing Date Statutory Net Worth_ ") is less than the Statutory Net Worth Requirement, then the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Statutory Net Worth Requirement minus the Closing Date Statutory Net Worth. If the Regulated Subsidiaries Closing Date Statutory Net Worth is more than the Statutory Net Worth Requirement, then the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the Closing 

   ##### 

  

    

Date Statutory Net Worth minus the Statutory Net Worth Requirement. If the
Companys Net Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheets (the
" _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ") is less than the Net Working Capital
Requirement, then the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
equal to the Net Working Capital Requirement minus the Closing Date Net
Working Capital. If the Companys Closing Date Net Working Capital is more
than the Net Working Capital Requirement, then the Base Purchase Price shall
be increased by an amount equal to the Closing Date Net Working Capital minus
the Net Working Capital Requirement. Any such adjustment shall be paid as
provided in _Section 3.2(a)_. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_.The following post-closing adjustments shall be made to the Base Purchase Price: 

  

 (a) _Closing Balance Sheets_. As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days, after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared by the Company and delivered to Sellers Representative Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets accompanied by a certificate of the Companys Chief Financial Officer specifying that each was prepared in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_ and setting forth Buyers calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable, in reasonable detail. Buyer agrees that until resolution of all disputes under this _Section 2.5_ following the Closing it shall not take any actions with respect to the books and records on which the Closing Balance Sheets are based that are inconsistent with the past practices of Company or the Regulated Subsidiaries and the accounting principles, policies, practices, judgments and methodologies, including with respect to determining estimates and allowances, used in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Entities Balance Sheet and the State Regulatory Filings, other than as required by GAAP or Statutory Accounting Principles, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) no changes shall be made in any reserve or other account existing as of the date of the Audited Combined Entities Balance Sheet or the State Regulatory Filings except as a result of events occurring after the date of such balance sheets or otherwise required by GAAP or Statutory Accounting Principles; and (ii) the final Closing Balance Sheets shall contain accruals for any liabilities and obligations related to the items described in _Sections 3.2(b)(ii)_ , _3.2(b)(iii)_ , _3.2(b)(iv)_ and _3.2(b)(v)_ , to the extent not paid at Closing. 

   

 (b) _Reconciliation; Disputes; Audit_. Upon receipt of Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets and Buyers calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working Capital as provided in _Section 2.5(a)_, the Sellers Representative may indicate in writing to Buyer within forty-five (45) Business Days after delivery of the documents referred to in _Section 2.5(a)_ whether the Sellers Representative disputes Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets or Buyers calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth or Closing Date Net Working Capital. Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative and its accountants prompt and reasonable access to the books and records, the work papers used by Buyer and the Company in preparation of Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets (including by directing their auditors to provide access to their work papers to Sellers Representative and its accounts), and any information Buyer or the Company owns or has access to, to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers Representative to complete its review of Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets. Such notice of disagreement shall specify Sellers Representatives calculations of such amounts and, in reasonable detail, the Sellers Representatives grounds for 

    ##### 

  

    

such disagreement. If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall attempt in good faith to resolve such disputes. If the Sellers
Representative does not deliver a notice of disagreement, then Buyers
proposed final Closing Balance Sheets and Buyers calculation of Closing Date
Statutory Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be deemed to
be accepted by the Sellers. If the Sellers Representative delivers a notice
of disagreement and the Sellers Representative and Buyer are not able to
resolve such dispute, then the Sellers Representative and Buyer will
mutually engage Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Auditor_ ") to conduct a review
of the disputed items or amounts as set forth in the Sellers
Representatives notice of disagreement. If at such time the designated
Auditor shall have any material relationship with Buyer or Sellers
Representative or shall be otherwise unable or unwilling to serve as Auditor,
then Buyer and Sellers Representative shall promptly cause independent
accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and Sellers Representative (who shall not have any material
relationship with Buyer or Sellers Representative) to serve as Auditor. In
making such calculations, the Auditor shall consider only those items or
amounts in Buyers proposed final Closing Balance Sheets or Buyers
calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working
Capital, as to which Sellers Representative has disagreed. The Auditor shall
not assign a value to any item less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by Buyer or Sellers Representative or greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers Representative and shall
be limited to the selection of either Buyers or Sellers Representatives
position on a disputed item (or a position in between the positions of Buyer
and Sellers Representative). The Auditor shall deliver to Buyer and Sellers
Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in all events shall be
instructed to deliver such report no later than sixty (60) days after the
matter is referred to the Auditor), a report setting forth the Auditors
calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working
Capital, as applicable. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Sellers Representative. The cost of such review and report shall be allocated
between the Sellers and Buyer in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed by each (as finally determined by
the Auditor) bears to the total amount of the disputed items. Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall make readily available to the Auditor all
relevant books and records and any workpapers (including those of the
parties respective accountants) relating to the Closing Balance Sheets and
all other items reasonably requested by the Auditor. 

   

 (c) _Adjustment for Reconciliation of Closing Balance Sheets._ In the event that the estimated Regulated Subsidiaries Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and the estimated Companys Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and used to adjust the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ were overstated in the aggregate as determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Sections 2.5(a)_ and _2.5(b)_ , then the Base Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount equal to the amount of that overstatement. Alternatively, in the event that the estimated Regulated Subsidiaries Closing Date Statutory Net Worth and the estimated Companys Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and used to adjust the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ were understated in the aggregate as determined pursuant to _Sections 2.5(a)_ and _2.5(b)_ , then the Base Purchase Price will be increased by an amount equal to the amount of that understatement. Any amount due from Buyer to the Sellers shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days following final determination of such amount pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ above. Any amount due from the Sellers to Buyer shall be paid to Buyer by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account within five (5) Business Days following final determination of such amount pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ above. 

     ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.6 _Sellers  Representative_. (a) The Sellers Representative is authorized to make all decisions and take all actions on behalf of each of the Sellers, including (a) determining whether the conditions to the Sellers obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in  _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or should be waived, (b) the receipt from Buyer of all payments made by Buyer to any Seller pursuant to this Agreement, (c) the giving and receiving of notices to be given or received by any Seller, and (d) the contest, defense or settlement of any claims, and making payments in connection therewith, for which any Seller may be required or requested to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant hereto. All decisions and actions by the Sellers Representative shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Buyer shall be entitled to deal with and rely conclusively on the Sellers Representative as provided herein as if, and with the same effect as if, the Sellers Representative constituted all of the Sellers. Any amount received by Sellers Representative on behalf of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be distributed among Sellers, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in proportion to such Sellers respective Percentage Interests. 

  

 (b) Upon the death or adjudicated incompetence or incapacity of any individual appointed as the Sellers Representative (such representative, the " _Retiring Sellers  Representative_"), the Sellers may appoint a successor of such individual to serve as the Sellers Representative. Such appointment shall require the approval of those Sellers (or their respective successors) who own, as of the date hereof, at least a majority of the Membership Interests held by all such Sellers. If no such successor Sellers Representative shall have been appointed and accepted such appointment within five (5) days after such event, Rebecca J. Scott shall be deemed to have been appointed Sellers Representative. Any successor Sellers Representative appointed pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Retiring Sellers Representative, and the Retiring Sellers Representative shall be discharged from his or her duties and obligations hereunder. The Sellers shall provide the Buyer with a prior written notice with respect to any appointment of a successor representative in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.6(b)_, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of such appointment.

 _ARTICLE VII_  

   

CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE SELLERS, THE COMPANY AND BUYER  

  

 Section 7.1 _Access and Information_. 

  

 (a) The Sellers and the Company shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to permit Buyer and its Representatives after the date of this Agreement to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Real Property, subject to the Companys reasonable rules and regulations, but not the right to perform any invasive or environmental testing or sampling or other "Phase II" investigations, _provided_ that Buyer shall maintain and deliver evidence upon request to the Company of adequate insurance before entering any Real Property and indemnify the Company for any physical damage to property caused by Buyer or Buyers Representatives in connection with such access by Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall permit Buyers transition planning team reasonable on-site access to their offices during regular business hours for the purposes of meeting with their management, developing an understanding of the decisions of such management and coordinating and planning the transition of the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Buyer any financial and operating data and other 

   ##### 

  

    

information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including without limitation continued access to the online data room (it
being understood that Sellers and the Company shall have no obligation to
continue to update such online data room), as Buyer shall from time to time
reasonably request and shall maintain or cause to be maintained intact all
electronic files and records to the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practices. It is
expressly understood by the parties hereto that, notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 7.1_, the Company, in its sole discretion, may
deny or restrict any access (i) involving possible breaches of applicable
confidentiality agreements with third parties or environmental reviews the
written work plan for which had not been previously approved by the Company
in its sole discretion, or possible waivers of any applicable attorney-client
privileges; or (ii) in the event Buyer is in breach of this Agreement. It
is further understood that the Company shall be under no obligation to grant
Buyer or its representatives any access if such access would unreasonably
interfere with the Company and its Subsidiaries operations, activities or
employees, or if such access would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, violate applicable antitrust, industrial security, patient privacy
or similar laws. In an effort to prevent any interference or disruption
caused by such access, the Company may, at its sole discretion, reasonably
limit the number of individuals visiting its facilities. Buyer shall
coordinate all such access with a Company employee who will be identified to
Buyer promptly after the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the prior
written consent of the Company, which may not be unreasonably withheld, Buyer
shall not contact any non-management employee, supplier to or customer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the identity of such
suppliers and customers shall have been made available to Buyer and provided
further that such restrictions shall not apply to any suppliers or customers
with which Buyer has a relationship as of the date hereof so long as such
contact relates solely to such current relationship and not the Company
or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) All information provided or obtained by Buyer heretofore or hereafter, including pursuant to clause (a) above, shall be held in confidence by Buyer in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 24, 2007, between Buyer and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive from the date hereof until the Closing and shall terminate at the Closing. The parties hereby further agree that, in the event this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing for any reason, the term of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be extended until the later of the original expiration date and the date two years after the termination of this Agreement.

Buyer shall pay all fees associated with such registrations,

and waivers, including all fees payable in connection with the HSR Filing (as
defined below).

The HSR Filing shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of its HSR Filing, to request early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act and, if requested, use its reasonable best efforts to certify as soon as practicable their substantial compliance with any requests for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and the Company shall as promptly as practicable comply with the laws and regulations of any other Governmental Authority that are applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pursuant to which any consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with such Governmental Authority is necessary, but in no event shall each of the Company and Buyer make any necessary initial filings, notifications, reports, registrations or declarations with any such Governmental Authority or take any initial action required by such Governmental Authority later than the tenth Business Day following the date hereof. Buyer and the Company shall furnish to each other all such information as is necessary to prepare any such registration, declaration or filing. Buyer and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and the Company shall provide each other with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by Buyer to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) as necessary to comply with applicable law or contractual arrangements. 

  

 (c) (i) Each of Buyer, each Seller and the Company agrees that it will, if necessary to enable such parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, defend against any suits, actions or proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including by seeking to vacate or reverse any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other legal restraint or prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other Governmental Authority that is not yet final and nonappealable; and (ii) Buyer agrees that it shall make an offer to and enter into an agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division and/or any other Governmental Authority to undertake behavioral commitments or divest and hold separate pending such divestiture, any and all assets and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and/or approximately equivalent assets or businesses of Buyer) as are necessary to prevent the commencement of any action or proceeding seeking, and/or prevent the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, a decree, restraining or other order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction preventing the consummation, in whole or in part, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to permit the Sellers, the Company and Buyer to otherwise fully consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.2(c)_ will require Buyer to enter into an agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust 

   ##### 

  

    

Division or any other Government Authority to undertake behavioral commitments
or divestitures that would be material to the business of either Buyer and
its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limitation of
the foregoing, the Company, the Sellers, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any non-
United States foreign antitrust merger control laws or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this  _Section 7.2_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ so long as such party has up to the date of such termination complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 7.2_.

no public release or announcement concerning the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued by any party without the prior
consent of Buyer, the Sellers and the Company, except as such release or

applicable law, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement, to the extent practicable after using commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid such disclosure, shall allow the other parties reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

   

 Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Following the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take any necessary actions to provide that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any current or former officers, directors, managers or employees of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their respective predecessors) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided (i) in the Organizational Documents of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) in any agreement providing for indemnification by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any of the Company Indemnitees in effect on the date of this Agreement and which is set forth on _Section 7.5_ of the Disclosure Letter or (iii) under applicable law, shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continue in full force and effect on equal or more favorable terms (including, at the option of Buyer, in new indemnity agreements) and be honored by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing; _provided_ , that such indemnification shall be subject to limitations imposed from time to time by applicable law. Buyer further agrees to assume or cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to comply with the indemnification and continuing insurance obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary under each of the agreements set forth on _Section 7.5_ of the Disclosure Letter or provide for new insurance agreements with at least the same level of protection. Without the prior written consent of such Company Indemnitee, Buyer shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to settle any matter for which it or they are providing indemnification to any Company Indemnitee other than any settlement exclusively requiring the payment of monetary damages to be paid entirely by or on behalf of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation under this Agreement to indemnify any Company Indemnitee with respect to matters for which Buyer would be entitled to indemnification under _Article IX_. 

   

 (b) For six years from the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of the Companys directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least "A" that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing (the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such person currently covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policies held by or for the benefit of the Company on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums for such DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance, in which case, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to obtain as much coverage as possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum amount in aggregate premiums. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any action or claim (whether arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against any person covered by the DandO Insurance on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such action or claim. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Company or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_. 

   

 (e) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 7.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.5_ applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.5_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_).

Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Sellers contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any such non-material consent or waiver or (b) any lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such non-material consent or waiver. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consents and waivers; _provided, however_ , that such efforts shall not include any requirement of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to expend money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation, incur any obligation in favor of, or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to, any third party. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Termination of Agreements_. 

  

 On and as of the Closing, except as set forth in _Section 7.7_ of the Disclosure Letter, all Contracts between any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand (the " _Terminating Contracts_ "), shall be terminated as between them without any further force and effect, and there shall be no further obligations of any of the relevant parties thereunder following the Closing. Buyer agrees to take, and to cause its Subsidiaries to take, and the Sellers Representative agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to take, any action following the Closing that would be required to give effect to the termination of the Terminating Contracts.

With regards to income Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods that are due following the Closing, the Company shall provide the Sellers Representative with drafts of such completed Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date thereof for the Sellers Representatives review and approval which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall make revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative, subject to the requirements of applicable law. The Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds or credits (including interest paid therewith) received in respect of any Pre-Closing Taxes.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, Buyer may elect, upon written notice to the Company prior to the Closing, to have the Company, contingent upon the consummation of the Closing, terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, effective immediately prior to the Closing. In such event, Buyer will, and will cause Buyers 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the " _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_") to accept the direct rollover, as selected by each Affected Employee, of that portion of the Affected Employees accounts in the Florida Health Plan Administrators, LLC Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") that constitutes an "eligible rollover distribution" as that term is defined by section 402(c)(4) of the Code, provided that at the time an Affected Employee elects such a rollover that Affected Employee is employed by Buyer. Any such rollover will be effected in cash from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Affected Employee electing such rollover. Buyer and the Sellers will, and will cause the trustees of their respective 401(k) plans to, cooperate with each other with respect to the rollover of the eligible rollover distribution portions of the Affected Employees account balances in the Company 401(k) Plan to Buyers 401(k) Plan.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each Buyer Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Affected Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Buyer Plan to be waived for such Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions had not been satisfied or waived under the analogous Company Plans in which such Affected Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Buyer and each Buyer Plan shall credit any eligible expenses incurred by such Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of each Company Plan ending on the date such Affected Employee begins to participate in the corresponding Buyer Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to that Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Plan, to the extent permitted under ERISA and by any applicable insurer.

 Section 7.13 _Non-Compete_. 

  

 (a) Each Seller covenants and agrees that it will not, and will cause its controlled Affiliates and Representatives (on behalf of a Seller) not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer, engage, directly or indirectly, in the business of owning, operating, underwriting, administering or managing a health maintenance organization, preferred provider product, network rental arrangement, health insurance product, or other form of health benefit plan, including direct customer contracting in the State of Florida (a " _Competing Business_ ") for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date.

 (iv) to continue operating the businesses set forth on _Section 7.13_ of the Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (d) Each Seller acknowledges that the foregoing covenant not to compete is in consideration for the attendant benefits to be derived by such Seller under this Agreement that the covenant not to compete set forth herein is reasonable in time and scope, necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Buyer and a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of the breach or threatened breach of such covenant, Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other rights it may have at law or in equity, without the posting of bond or other surety. 

   

 Section 7.14 _Carefree and Sunrise Facility_.

 _ARTICLE IX_  

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 Section 9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except to the extent a different period is expressly set forth herein, the representations and warranties and covenants (to the extent such covenants relate to the performance of obligations prior to the Closing) in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Period Termination Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.1_, _4.3_ ,  _5.1_ and _5.2_ (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The covenants contained in this Agreement which relate to the performance of obligations after the Closing shall survive the Closing for the periods contemplated by their terms. No claim for indemnification hereunder for breach of any representations and warranties or covenants may be made after the expiration of the applicable survival period; _provided_ that any representation and warranty in respect of which indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.2_ or under _Section 9.3_, and the indemnity with respect thereto, shall survive (with respect to any claim that has been made) the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ if notice of a claim of breach or potential breach thereof giving rise to such right or potential right of indemnity shall have been given pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Article IX_ to the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time. 

  

 Section 9.2 _Indemnification for the Benefit of Buyer_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall, severally and not jointly, with respect to the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_, and jointly and severally, for all other purposes, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties"_ ) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, judgments, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) (" _Losses_ ") arising out of or resulting from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein by the Company or the Sellers or in any exhibit or certificate delivered by the Company or the Sellers hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ ,   ##### 

  

  

  

that, without duplication, such Losses arising out of or resulting from any
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.18_ shall be addressed exclusively in _Section 7.8_ and not pursuant to
this _Section 9.2(a)_ , (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or
agreement set forth herein by the Company or the Sellers or in any exhibit or
certificate delivered by the Company or the Sellers hereunder, (iii) any
Seller Transaction Expenses to the extent such are not paid out of the
Closing Adjusted Price and (iv) Covered Matters ( _provided_ that the Sellers
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties for only 50%
of the Losses arising out of or resulting from such Covered Matters);
_provided_ that no claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under clause (i)
or, with respect to breaches of the covenants and agreements set forth in
_Section 7.3_ , clause (ii) above shall be so asserted and the Sellers shall
have no liability or obligation to indemnify unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable hereunder from the Escrow
Amount exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $3,425,000.00 (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed
the Deductible; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no individual claim for
payment of a Loss may be made under clause (i) above or, with respect to
breaches of the covenants set forth in  _Section 7.3_, clause (ii) above
unless such claim is an amount of $25,000 or greater. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, claims asserted under clause (i) above for Losses arising from
any nonfulfillment or breach of any of the Fundamental Representations shall
not be subject to the Deductible and shall not otherwise count in determining
if the Deductible has been met. 

    

 (b) (i) The Buyer Indemnified Parties aggregate recovery for claims asserted under  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for Losses arising from any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or claims asserted under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ (other than any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in _Section 7.3_ or  _Section 7.13_) or _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall be limited to the Base Purchase Price (as finally determined, including all pre- and post-Closing adjustments). 

   

 (ii) Except as set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ above, the Buyer Indemnified Parties aggregate recovery for claims asserted under this _Section 9.2_ shall be limited to $34,250,000.00. 

  

 (c) All payments made from the Escrow Account shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article III_ hereof. 

   

 (d) (i) Except for the amount to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties, prior to the Survival Period Termination Date, previously made a claim (other than any claims related to the Covered Matters) pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Article IX_ and for which the obligations to indemnify, if any, shall not have been satisfied from the Escrow Amount (the " _Outstanding Escrow Claims_ "), title and all rights to the Escrow Amount shall automatically transfer to the Sellers, to the extent of their pro rata share on the Survival Period Termination Date, and (ii) Buyer shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Amount less the amount of the Outstanding Escrow Claims to the Sellers on the Survival Period Termination Date (but in any event within five (5) business days). As soon as the Outstanding Escrow Claims are resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Article IX_, Buyer shall cause the Escrow Agent to release any remaining cash held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event any of the Covered Matters is not resolved as of the Survival Period   ##### 

  

  

  

Termination Date, it shall not be considered an Outstanding Escrow Claim on
the Survival Period Termination Date. 

   

 Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer for the Benefit of the Sellers_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties"_ ) from and against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein by Buyer or in any exhibit or certificate delivered hereunder by Buyer and (b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth herein by Buyer or in any exhibit or certificate delivered hereunder by Buyer. The aggregate liability of Buyer to the Seller Indemnitees for Losses arising under this _Section 9.3_ shall be limited to an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price (as finally determined, including all pre- and post-Closing adjustments). 

  

 Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers Representative within fifteen (15) days after the determination thereof. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Method of Asserting Claims; Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), if applicable, of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim or demand against it (if by a third party), describing the claim or demand in reasonable detail, including the sections of this Agreement which form the basis for such claim or demand, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof, along with copies of all written evidence thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ "). Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense (such expense subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_), and, other than with respect to the Covered Matters, at its option shall be entitled to assume and control the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ that any Indemnitor shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained herein and, for the avoidance of doubt, an election to assume the defense of such claim shall not be deemed to be an admission that the Indemnitor is liable to the Indemnitee in respect of such claim;  _provided,_ _further_ , the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee. With respect to the Covered Matters, the Indemnitee shall assume and control the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ , the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; _provided_ _that_ , the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and 

   ##### 

  

    

obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice except for payments
that would be required to be paid by Buyer or its Subsidiaries representing
the Deductible. The Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall
act on behalf of all Indemnitors in the case of all claims with respect to
which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties is seeking indemnification from
the Sellers under _Section 9.2_ (with each Seller responsible for its pro
rata share of such costs and expenses to be paid from the Escrow Amount). In
the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitor is
not obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee from and against any third party
claim, the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Indemnitor for any and all costs
and expenses (including without limitation, attorneys fees and court costs)
incurred by the Indemnitor in its defense of the third party claim. In the
event that the Indemnitor declines to assume the defense of a claim, the
Indemnitee shall not settle a claim or demand without the consent of the
Indemnitor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. To the extent the
Indemnitor shall control or participate in the defense or settlement of any
third party claim, the Indemnitee will give the Indemnitor and its counsel
access to, during regular business hours, the relevant business records and
other documents, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and
counsel of the Indemnitee. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Loss, (ii) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto (a " _Collateral Source_ ") and (iii) any specific accruals or reserves (or overstatement of liabilities in respect of actual liability) included in the Financial Information. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The parties shall take and shall cause their Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy a breach that gives rise to the Loss. Indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall not be available to Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, unless the party seeking indemnification under this _Article IX_ first uses its reasonable best efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The parties acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation shall accrue or inure as a result of the provisions hereof to the benefit of any Collateral Source hereunder. The Indemnitor may require an Indemnitee to assign the rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee will then be responsible for pursuing such recovery at its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ is not received until after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_, the Indemnitee shall repay to the Indemnitor, promptly after such receipt, any amount that the Indemnitor would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Article IX_ had such receipt been made at the time of such payment. Buyer shall not make any claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_ in respect of any matter that is fully taken into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Article II_. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. In furtherance of the 

   ##### 

  

    

foregoing, the parties hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contribution, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any national,
federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or judicial
decision (including, without limitation, any such statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation or judicial decision relating to environmental
matters, or warranty of title, or arising under or based upon any securities
law, common law or otherwise). This _Section 9.6_ shall survive Closing. 

  

 Section 9.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnitor shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnitee or any other Person for consequential, indirect, incidental, special, unforeseen, exemplary or punitive damages, including diminution of value, lost profits, loss of business reputation or opportunity, that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the performance or breach thereof. 

  

 Section 9.8 _No Set-Off_. 

  

 Neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall have any right to set-off any Losses against any payments, or deduct from, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner, any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 _ARTICLE X_  

   

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 (a) by written agreement of Buyer and the Sellers; 

   

 (b) by either Buyer or the Sellers, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to February 28, 2008 (the "Termination Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, if the failure by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers and the Company, on the other hand, respectively, to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause or, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; 

   

 (c) by the Sellers if any Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction over a material portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries has initiated any suit, complaint, action or proceeding concerning the effects of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under antitrust, competition, merger control or similar laws, rules or regulations and such suit, complaint, action or proceeding remains pending; 

   

 (d) by either the Sellers or Buyer ( _provided_ that, in the case of a termination by Buyer, Buyer is in compliance with _Section 7.2_), upon written notice to the other, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Authority, in each case with   ##### 

  

  

  

competent jurisdiction over a material portion of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, shall have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order,
decree or injunction or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable, unless the failure to
consummate the Closing because of such action by a Governmental Entity shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement; or 

   

 (e) by the non-breaching party, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if, there has been a breach by such other party of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, which breach is the sole cause of the failure of the conditions in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied, _provided_ , _however_ , that if such breach or failure to perform is curable, the non-breaching party may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(e)_. 

   

 Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties hereto, and this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this  _Section 10.2_ and in _Sections 7.1(b)_, _11.1_ , _11.2_ , _11.3_ ,  _11.4_ , _11.5_ , _11.8_ , _11.10_ , _11.11_ and _11.12_ hereof, and except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination. 

  

 Section 10.3 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may only be amended or modified in writing, signed by the Company, the Sellers and Buyer, at any time prior to the Closing with respect to any of the terms contained herein.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed by the party granting such extension or waiver. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

  

 _ARTICLE XI_  

   

MISCELLANEOUS  

  

 Section 11.1 _Return of Information_. If for any reason whatsoever the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Buyer shall upon request from the Company promptly return to the Company all books, records and documents (including all 

   ##### 

  

    

copies, if any, thereof) furnished by the Company, the Sellers, or any of
their respective agents, employees, or representatives, and shall not use or
disclose any confidential non-public information contained in such books,
records or documents for any purpose or make such information available to any
other entity or person. 

  

 Section 11.2 _Non-Solicitation_. Buyer agrees that, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, the term set forth in Section 5 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be extended for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of such termination.

Unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement and subject to  _Section 7.2(a)_, the parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including, without limitation, all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are completed, at the Closing the parties shall pay all Seller Transaction Expenses as directed by the Sellers out of the Closing Adjusted Price (and the associated reduction of the Closing Adjusted Price by the amount of such fees and expenses will be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Adjusted Price for tax and financial reporting purposes). 

  

 Section 11.4 _Assignment; No Third Party Rights_. Except as provided in the following sentence or as consented to in writing by Buyer, the Sellers and the Company, this Agreement may not be assigned, whether by operation of law, sale of substantially all the assets of a party, or otherwise. Buyer may assign or delegate its rights, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement in whole or in part to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer and Buyer shall be permitted to make a collateral assignment of this Agreement to any financial institution provided funding to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, (i) Buyer shall remain fully liable for the fulfillment of all such obligations and (ii) the Sellers and the Company incur no additional cost or obligation as a result of any assignment or delegation, including, by way of example and not by way of limitation, an assignment or delegation which would prevent any purchase from constituting a sale or transfer of a business or going concern or other similar disposition under any relevant laws or regulations. Any attempted assignment or delegation in contravention hereof shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and, except with respect to _Section 7.5_, is not intended to give any other Person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim.

The parties acknowledge that each of Buyer, the Sellers and the Company participated in the drafting of this Agreement and agree that any rule of law or any legal decision that may or would require interpretation of any alleged ambiguities in this Agreement against the party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement (including the

representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions hereof)
and the terms of any other documents delivered or required to be delivered in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement
shall supersede such conflicting or inconsistent terms (including by way of
illustration and not limitation, an instance where a warranty in a deed of
transfer imposes, implicitly or explicitly, greater obligations on
the grantor than are imposed by the terms of this Agreement) in such other
documents and the terms of this Agreement shall define the rights and
obligations of the parties and their respective officers, directors,
employees, interest holders, stockholders and Affiliates with respect to
the subject matter of such conflict or inconsistency. 

  

 Section 11.6 _Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of any matter in any section of the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an inclusion for purposes of the representation and warranty to which it expressly applies, or any other representation or warranty to which its applicability is reasonably apparent, but inclusion thereon shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Sellers, the Company or Buyer, as applicable, or otherwise imply that any such matter is material, has a Material Adverse Effect or creates a measure for, or further defines the meaning of, materiality or Material Adverse Effect and their correlative terms for the purposes of this Agreement. Certain matters disclosed in the Disclosure Letter are not believed to be material, and are not required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the representations and warranties in this Agreement. Such immaterial matters are disclosed for informational purposes only. No disclosure on any section of the Disclosure Letter relating to a possible breach or violation of any contract or law shall be construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. 

  

 Section 11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument. 

  

 Section 11.8 _Section Headings_. The section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in any, way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
