designated Auditor shall have any material relationship with Buyer or Sellers&#146; Representative or
shall be otherwise unable or unwilling to serve as Auditor, then Buyer and Sellers&#146; Representative
shall promptly cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers&#146; Representative (who shall not have any material relationship

limited to the selection of either Buyer&#146;s or Sellers&#146; Representative&#146;s position on a disputed item

deliver to Buyer and Sellers&#146; Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in all events shall
be instructed to deliver such report no later than sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the matter is referred to
the Auditor), a report setting forth the Auditor&#146;s calculation of Closing Date Statutory Net Worth
and Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Sellers&#146; Representative. The cost of such review and report shall be allocated between
the Sellers and Buyer in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the items unsuccessfully
disputed by each (as finally determined by the Auditor) bears to the total amount of the disputed
items. Buyer and Sellers&#146; Representative shall make readily available to the Auditor all relevant
books and records and any workpapers (including those of the parties&#146; respective accountants)
relating to the Closing Balance Sheets and all other items reasonably requested by the Auditor.

Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Loss, (ii)&nbsp;any insurance proceeds or any

with respect thereto (a &#147;<U>Collateral Source</U>&#148;) and (iii)&nbsp;any specific accruals or reserves

reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the
highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The parties shall take and
shall cause their Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware
of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy a breach that gives rise to the Loss.
Indemnification under
this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> shall not be available to Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be,
unless the party seeking indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> first uses its reasonable
best efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The parties acknowledge and agree that
no right of subrogation shall accrue or inure as a result of the provisions hereof to the benefit
of any Collateral Source hereunder. The Indemnitor may require an Indemnitee to assign the rights
to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence; <U>provided</U>, that the Indemnitee will
then be responsible for pursuing such recovery at its own expense. If the amount to be netted
hereunder from any payment required under <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U> is not
received until after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
