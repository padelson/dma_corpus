 **THIS AGREEMENT** is made on 18 July, 2014

 



 

 **BETWEEN:**

 



 

(1) **ABBVIE INC.** a Delaware corporation whose registered office in the
State of Delaware is at c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington, Delaware 19801, U.S.A. (" **AbbVie** "); and

 



 

(2) **SHIRE PLC** a company incorporated in Jersey (registered number 99854)
and whose registered office is at 22 Grenville Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE4
8PX ( **"Shire** "),

 



 

together referred to as the **"Parties"** and each as a **"Party"** to this
Agreement.

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

(A) AbbVie and Shire intend to effect the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set out in the Press Announcement.

 



 

(B) The Parties intend the Merger to be implemented as set out in the Press
Announcement, currently anticipated to involve a scheme of arrangement under
Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law and a merger pursuant to the Delaware
General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Act.

 



 

(C) AbbVie, New AbbVie and Merger Sub have executed and delivered an agreement
and plan of merger, dated as of the date hereof.

 



 

(D) The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement to set out certain
mutual commitments to regulate the basis on which they are willing to
implement the Merger.

 



 

 **IT IS AGREED** as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****UNDERTAKINGS TO IMPLEMENT THE MERGER AND OBTAIN CLEARANCES**

 



 

 **Regulatory Conditions**

 



 

1.1 Except where Shire is required by law to make its own separate filing, and
subject to the provisions of Clause 1.3, AbbVie shall be responsible for
contacting and corresponding with the relevant Regulatory Authorities in
relation to the Regulatory Conditions and the Clearances related to the
Regulatory Conditions, including preparing and submitting all necessary
filings, notifications and submissions as soon as reasonably practicable.
AbbVie shall consult with Shire to the extent reasonably practicable and keep
Shire updated as to progress towards the satisfaction of the Regulatory
Conditions, including by taking the steps set out below.

 



 

1.2 Shire undertakes to cooperate with AbbVie in relation to the Regulatory
Conditions and to assist AbbVie in communicating with any Regulatory Authority
in relation to the Clearances and promptly to provide such information and
assistance to AbbVie as AbbVie may reasonably require for the purposes of
obtaining any Clearance and making a submission, filing or notification to any
relevant Regulatory Authority as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Undertakings to satisfy the Conditions**

 



 

1.3 AbbVie undertakes to Shire to:

 



 

1.3.1 where reasonably requested by Shire, provided that, in AbbVies
reasonable opinion, it is practicable to do so, and except to the extent that
to do so (i) would lead to legal privilege being lost or waived; or (ii) is
prohibited by the relevant Regulatory Authority or by Law:

 



 

(A) provide, or procure the provision of, to Shire (or its nominated advisers)
draft copies of all material filings, notifications, submissions and
communications to be made to:

 



 

(i) the European Commission or the US Federal Trade Commission by or on behalf
of AbbVie in relation to obtaining any Clearance; and

 



 

(ii) any other Regulatory Authority by or on behalf of AbbVie in relation to
obtaining any Clearance where the approach taken by AbbVie in relation to such
filing, notification, submission or communication differs materially from the
approach to be taken in the filings, notifications, submissions and
communications to be made by AbbVie in relation to obtaining the Clearances
referred to in Clause 1.3.1(A)(i),

 



 

at such time as will allow Shire a reasonable opportunity to provide comments
on such filings, notifications, submissions and communications before they are
submitted or sent;

 



 

(B) have regard in good faith to comments made by Shire on the filings,
notifications, submissions and communications provided to Shire pursuant to
Clause 1.3.1(A) and to take into account such comments as AbbVie determines,
in good faith, are reasonable;

 



 

(C) provide Shire (or such nominated advisers) with copies of all material
filings, notifications, submissions and communications in the form submitted
or sent to any Regulatory Authority by or on behalf of AbbVie in relation to
obtaining any Clearances; and

 



 

(D) give Shire reasonable prior notice of and allow persons nominated by Shire
to attend all material meetings and telephone calls with any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the obtaining of all requisite Clearances and,
with the prior consent of AbbVie (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), to make reasonable oral submissions during such meetings and
telephone calls; and

 



 

1.3.2 except to the extent that to do so is prohibited by the relevant
Regulatory Authority or by Law, promptly notify Shire (or its nominated
advisers) of and provide copies of any material communications from any
Regulatory Authority in relation to obtaining any Clearances; and

 



      
 

 



 

1.4 Shire undertakes to AbbVie to:

 



 

1.4.1 where reasonably requested by AbbVie and except to the extent that to do
so (i) would lead to legal privilege being lost or waived; or (ii) is
prohibited by the relevant Regulatory Authority or by Law:

 



 

(A) provide, or procure the provision of, to AbbVie (or its nominated
advisers) draft copies of all filings, notifications, submissions and
communications to be made to any Regulatory Authority by or on behalf of
Shire, if any, in relation to obtaining any Clearance, at such time as will
allow AbbVie a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on such filings,
notifications, submissions and communications before they are submitted or
sent;

 



 

(B) have regard in good faith to comments made by AbbVie on the filings,
notifications, submissions and communications provided to AbbVie pursuant to
Clause 1.4.1(A) and to take into account such comments as are reasonable;

 



 

(C) provide AbbVie (or such nominated advisers) with copies of all material
filings, notifications, submissions and communications in the form submitted
or sent to any Regulatory Authority by or on behalf of Shire in relation to
obtaining any Clearances; and

 



 

(D) give AbbVie reasonable prior notice of and allow persons nominated by
AbbVie to attend all meetings and telephone calls with any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the obtaining of all requisite Clearances and to
make oral submissions during such meetings and telephone calls; and

 



 

1.4.2 except to the extent that to do so is prohibited by the relevant
Regulatory Authority or by Law, promptly notify AbbVie (or its nominated
advisers) of and provide copies of any communications from any Regulatory
Authority in relation to obtaining any Clearances.

 



 

 **Undertakings to implement the Acquisition**

 



 

1.5 AbbVie undertakes to Shire to:

 



 

1.5.1 co-operate with Shire and its advisers to take all such steps as are
reasonably necessary to implement the Acquisition in substantially in the form
contemplated by the Press Announcement; and

 



 

1.5.2 keep Shire informed of the progress towards satisfaction (or otherwise)
of the Regulatory Conditions and, if AbbVie is, or becomes, aware of any
matter which might reasonably be considered to be material in the context of
the satisfaction or waiver of any of the Conditions, AbbVie will as soon as
reasonably practicable make the substance of any such matter known to Shire
and, so far as it is aware of the same, provide such details and further
information as Shire may reasonably request.

 



 

1.6 Shire undertakes to AbbVie to keep it informed of the progress towards
satisfaction (or otherwise) of the Regulatory Conditions and, if Shire is, or
becomes, aware of any matter which might reasonably be considered to be
material in the context of the satisfaction or waiver of any of the Regulatory
Conditions, Shire will as soon as reasonably practicable make the substance of
any such matter known to AbbVie and, so far as it is aware of the same,
provide such details and further information as AbbVie may reasonably request.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Qualifications**

 



 

1.7 Nothing in Clauses 1.1 to 1.6 inclusive shall require either Party to
disclose any competitively sensitive or confidential information or business
secrets which have not been previously disclosed to the other Party, in which
case this information is to be communicated between AbbVies and Shires
advisers on an "external adviser only" basis (a non-confidential version of
the relevant filing, notification, submission or communication being provided
to the other).

 



 

1.8 Nothing in Clauses 1.1 to 1.6 inclusive shall require the Parties to offer
to any Regulatory Authority, accept or agree any undertakings, commitments,
conditions, modifications or remedies, whether involving divestments or
disposals or constraints on prices or other behaviour or otherwise, in order
to obtain the satisfaction of the Regulatory Conditions.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW ABBVIE, MERGER STRUCTURE AND ADVERSE
RECOMMENDATION CHANGE**

 



 

2.1 AbbVie undertakes to Shire to:

 



 

(A) as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with the issuance of the New AbbVie Shares
in the US Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus constituting a
part thereof) (the " **Proxy Statement/Prospectus** "), if Shire provides all
cooperation reasonably requested by AbbVie in connection therewith. Subject to
clause 2.3, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the AbbVie
Recommendation. AbbVie shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to become effective under the 1933 Act as soon after such
filing as practicable and to keep the Proxy Statement/Prospectus effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Acquisition and the US Merger, if Shire
provides all cooperation reasonably requested by AbbVie in connection
therewith. Where the Acquisition is being implemented by way of a scheme,
AbbVie undertakes that it will use its reasonable efforts to cause all New
AbbVie Shares issued on completion of the Scheme to Shire Shareholders to be
issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the
1933 Act, provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the 1933 Act and in reliance on
exemptions from registration under state "blue sky" or securities laws if
Shire provides all cooperation reasonably requested by AbbVie in connection
therewith.

 



 

(B) cause a meeting of its shareholders (the " **AbbVie Shareholders Meeting**
") to be duly called and held no later than 40 days after the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is declared effective under the 1933 Act) for the purpose
of voting on the Delaware Merger Agreement and AbbVie shall not, without the
prior written consent of Shire, adjourn or postpone the AbbVie Shareholders
Meeting; provided that AbbVie may, without the prior written consent of Shire,
adjourn or postpone the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting (a) if as of the time for
which the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient AbbVie
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting, (b)
after consultation with Shire, if

 



      
 

 



 

the failure to adjourn or postpone the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting would
reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the
distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (c) after consultation with Shire, for a single period
not to exceed ten Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to
obtain the AbbVie Shareholder Approval, or (d) if necessary, due to an
adjournment of the Shire Meetings but without prejudice to Condition 1(a), to
ensure that the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting is held immediately before the
Scheme Meeting. Shire may once require AbbVie to adjourn, delay or postpone
the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting for a period not to exceed 10 business days
(but such period shall end prior to the date that is two Business Days prior
to the Long Stop Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the
AbbVie Shareholder Approval. In connection with the AbbVie Shareholders
Meeting, the board of Directors of AbbVie shall (A) subject to clause 2.3, (1)
recommend the adoption of the Delaware Merger Agreement by the holders of
AbbVie Shares (the " **AbbVie Recommendation** ") and (2) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the AbbVie Shareholder Approval and (B) otherwise
comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Once Shire has
established a record date for the Shire Meetings, AbbVie shall not change the
record date or establish a different record date for the AbbVie Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Shire, unless required to do so
by applicable Law or AbbVies organizational documents. Without the prior
written consent of Shire, the approval of the Delaware Merger Agreement shall
be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable Law to be voted on by AbbVies stockholders in connection with the
approval of the Delaware Merger Agreement) that AbbVie shall propose to be
acted on by AbbVie stockholders at the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting;

 



 

(C) cause the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting to be held prior to the Shire
Meetings and, in relation thereto, it being acknowledged and agreed that
AbbVie shall not be able to invoke Conditions 1(a) or 1(b) where the
applicable meetings have not been held by the applicable Long Stop Date solely
as a result of the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting not yet having been held
(including as a result of any adjournment, delay or postponement contemplated
by Clause 2.1(B));

 



 

(D) procure that the New AbbVie Shares to be issued to: (i) Shire Shareholders
pursuant to the Scheme (or the Offer, as the case may be); and (ii) the
holders of AbbVie Shares pursuant to the US Merger, shall rank pari passu,
save to the extent expressly provided otherwise in the Press Announcement or
as otherwise agreed between the Parties;

 



 

(E) procure that the terms of the US Merger shall be such that AbbVie
stockholders shall exchange one AbbVie Share for one New AbbVie Share;

 



 

(F) immediately following the Acquisition becoming Effective and the Shire
Shareholders being entered in the register of members of New AbbVie in
accordance with the Scheme Order, implement the US Merger in accordance with
the Delaware Merger Agreement;

 



 

(G) procure that New AbbVie adopts new articles of association, with effect
from the Effective Date, appropriate for a company listed on the New York
Stock Exchange with one class of listed securities in issue and which follow
in all material respects the existing governance arrangements of AbbVie, save
as, in

 



      
 

 



 

the reasonable opinion of AbbVie, reasonably required to be modified in order
appropriately to meet the laws and customs of Jersey, and provided that AbbVie
will have regard in good faith to comments made by Shire on the new articles
of association and will take into account such comments as AbbVie considers in
good faith are reasonable and appropriate; and

 



 

(H) shall not invoke Condition 1(b) until the date falling 10 Business Days
following the date on which all of the other Conditions are satisfied or
waived.

 



 

2.2 Except as permitted by clause 2.3, AbbVie shall not make an AbbVie Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

2.3 Notwithstanding clause 2.2 but subject to clause 2.4, at any time prior to
the AbbVie Shareholder Approval, the board of Directors of AbbVie may make an
AbbVie Adverse Recommendation Change only if the board of Directors of AbbVie
determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering advice from
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict AbbVie or the AbbVie Directors
from taking and disclosing to the AbbVie stockholders a position or making a
statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or other applicable Law; provided, however, that if such disclosure
has the substantive effect of withdrawing or modifying in a manner adverse to
the consummation of the Merger the AbbVie Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a AbbVie Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

2.4 The board of Directors of AbbVie shall not make an AbbVie Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless AbbVie has provided Shire at least three
Business Days prior notice of its intention to consider making an AbbVie
Adverse Recommendation Change, attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of
the reasons for the potential AbbVie Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****DOCUMENTATION**

 



 

3.1 For so long as the Acquisition is to be implemented by way of the Scheme,
AbbVie undertakes:

 



 

3.1.1 to provide promptly to Shire all such information about itself, the
AbbVie Group and the AbbVie Directors and their associates as may be required
for the purpose of inclusion in the Scheme Document (" **AbbVie Information**
") and to provide all other assistance which may be reasonably required in
connection with the preparation of the Scheme Document, including access to
and ensuring reasonable assistance is provided by its professional advisers.

 



 

3.1.2 to procure that the AbbVie Directors accept responsibility for all
information in the Scheme Document relating to themselves, their associates,
AbbVie and the AbbVie Group.

 



 

3.2 If any supplemental circular or document is required to be published in
connection with the Scheme or, subject to the prior written consent of AbbVie,
any variation or amendment to the Scheme (a " **Scheme Supplemental Document**
"), AbbVie shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide such co-operation
and information (including such information as is

 



      
 

 



 

necessary for the Scheme Supplemental Document to comply with all applicable
legal and regulatory provisions) as Shire may reasonably request in order to
finalise the relevant Scheme Supplemental Document (such information also
being " **AbbVie Information"** ).

 



 

3.3 Where AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of an Offer,
AbbVie shall prepare the Offer Document and shall consult Shire in relation
thereto. AbbVie agrees to submit, or procure the submission of drafts and
revised drafts of the Offer Document to Shire for review and comment and, upon
reasonable request and where necessary, to discuss any comments with Shire for
the purposes of preparing revised drafts. AbbVie agrees to seek Shires
approval of the contents of the Shire Information in the Offer Document before
it is posted or published, and to afford Shire sufficient time to consider
such documents, in order to give its approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, but without prejudice to Shires ability to
withdraw the Shire Recommendation).

 



 

 **4.** ** ****IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME**

 



 

4.1 Where the Acquisition is being implemented by way of the Scheme, AbbVie
undertakes that before the Sanction Hearing, it shall deliver a notice in
writing to Shire either: (i) confirming the satisfaction or waiver of all
Conditions (other than Condition 2(c) (Court Sanction)); or (ii) confirming
its intention to invoke a Condition and, if (ii), it shall as soon as
reasonably practicable following such event or circumstance provide reasonable
details of the event which has occurred, or circumstance which has arisen,
which AbbVie reasonably considers is sufficiently material for the Panel to
permit AbbVie to invoke any of the Conditions.

 



 

4.2 AbbVie shall, and shall procure that New AbbVie shall, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all Conditions,
agree to be bound by and consent to the implementation of the Scheme. For this
purpose, AbbVie shall instruct counsel to appear on its behalf at the Sanction
Hearing and undertake to the Court to be bound by the terms of the Scheme.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****EMPLOYEE AND SHARE PLAN ARRANGEMENTS**

 



 

The provisions of Schedule 3 will apply in relation to Shire employees and
share plans.

 



 

 **6.** ** ****CONDUCT OF BUSINESS**

 



 

6.1 Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as consented to in
writing by Shire (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or as required by applicable Law, from the date hereof until the
Effective Date, AbbVie shall not:

 



 

6.1.1 authorise or pay any dividends on or make any distribution with respect
to its outstanding shares of capital stock (whether in cash, assets, stock or
other securities of AbbVie except AbbVie may (A) continue to pay dividends in
the ordinary course and consistent with its existing dividend policy
(including as to amount) and timetable and (B) pay dividends and distributions
with a record date after the Effective Date; and

 



 

6.1.2 split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock, or issue or
authorise the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for, shares of its capital stock, except for (A) (unless such
transaction would be reasonably expected to have material adverse tax
consequences to New

 



      
 

 



 

AbbVie and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date) any such transaction by
a wholly owned Subsidiary of AbbVie which remains a wholly owned Subsidiary
after consummation of such transaction, (B) any such action in respect of New
AbbVies capital stock in furtherance of the Merger, and (C) grants of AbbVie
Options and AbbVie Share Awards in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice;

 



 

6.1.3 other than at arms length terms, directly or indirectly, purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares in its capital or any rights, warrants
or options to acquire any such shares in its capital, except for transactions
among AbbVie and its wholly owned Subsidiaries or among AbbVies wholly owned
Subsidiaries (unless such transaction would be reasonably expected to have
material adverse tax consequences to New AbbVie and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Date);

 



 

6.1.4 shall not amend the AbbVie organizational documents in any manner that
would have a material and adverse impact on the value of the New AbbVie
Shares;

 



 

6.1.5 other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice and in each case other than in relation to employee benefits, issue
or grant or authorise the issuance or grant of any shares of its capital
stock, voting securities or other equity interest in AbbVie or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares, voting securities or
equity interest, or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any such shares
of capital stock, voting securities or equity interest (" **AbbVie
Securities** "), that are issued, granted or authorized for issuance or grant
at less than the fair market value of the relevant AbbVie Securities on the
date of issuance, grant or authorization, provided, however, that for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Clause 6.1.5 shall prohibit (A)
transactions among AbbVie and its wholly owned Subsidiaries or among AbbVies
wholly owned Subsidiaries (B) issuances of AbbVie Shares in respect of any
exercise of AbbVie Options or the vesting or settlement of AbbVie Share Awards
in accordance with their terms and the applicable AbbVie Stock Plan, (C)
withholding of AbbVie Shares to satisfy (x) tax obligations pertaining to the
exercise of AbbVie Options or the vesting or settlement of AbbVie Share Awards
or (y) the exercise price with respect to AbbVie Options and (D) grants of
AbbVie Options and AbbVie Share Awards; and

 



 

6.1.6 agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****BREAK FEE**

 



 

7.1 In consideration of Shire incurring substantial costs and expenses in
preparing and negotiating the Acquisition and this Agreement, AbbVie
undertakes that on the occurrence of a Break Fee Payment Event (as defined
below) AbbVie will pay to Shire an amount in cash in US Dollars equal to three
per cent of the product of the indicative value of the cash and shares to be
delivered per Shire Share multiplied by the number of issued Shire Shares as
set forth in Annex A and converted pursuant to the exchange rate set forth in
Annex B (the " **Break Fee** ").

 



       
 

 



 

7.2 A **"Break Fee Payment Event"** shall occur in the event that at or prior
to the termination of this Agreement:

 



 

7.2.1 both (i) an AbbVie Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred and (ii)
either (a) the AbbVie Shareholder Approval has not been obtained at the AbbVie
Shareholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, at which a
vote on the adoption of the Delaware Merger Agreement is taken (such event
being an " **Adverse Shareholder Vote** ") or (b) a meeting of AbbVies
stockholders at which a vote on the adoption of the Delaware Merger Agreement
is proposed has not occurred on or before the date falling 60 days (such date
being the " **Shareholder Long Stop Date"** ) after the date of the AbbVie
Adverse Recommendation Change or, (c) on or prior to the Shareholder Long Stop
Date this Agreement terminates pursuant to clause 10.1.1 and, at the time of
such termination, the AbbVie Shareholder Approval has not been received; or

 



 

7.2.2 Either:

 



 

(A) on or before 30 April 2015, or such later date if any as AbbVie and Shire
may agree, the Scheme (or the Offer as the case may be) is withdrawn or lapses
(any such event being a " **Withdrawal Event** ") as a result of AbbVie or, as
the case may be, New AbbVie invoking and being permitted by the Panel to
invoke any Regulatory Condition; or

 



 

(B) on or before 30 April 2015, or such later date, if any, as AbbVie and
Shire may agree a Withdrawal Event occurs as a result of AbbVies failure to
waive any Regulatory Condition which is breached, unfulfilled or unsatisfied;
or

 



 

(C) the European Commission has on or before 30 April, 2015, or such later
date, if any, as AbbVie and Shire may agree, initiated Phase 2 European
Commission Proceedings under the EU Merger Regulation or has referred (or been
deemed to have referred) any part of the Merger to the Merger Control
Authority of one or more Member States of the European Union under Article 9
of the EU Merger Regulation and either (a) the Scheme or Offer, as the case
may be, has lapsed because of the initiation of such Phase 2 European
Commission Proceedings or, following an Article 9 reference to the CMA,
because of a Phase 2 CMA Reference in respect of the Merger or (b) the Scheme
or the Offer as the case may be, has not so lapsed but AbbVie has invoked

occurrence of a Break Fee Payment Event.

 **8.** ** ****DIRECTORS  AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE**

 



 

8.1 At and after the Effective Date, New AbbVie shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director or officer of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries and each person
who, while a director or officer of Shire and any of its Subsidiaries, served
at the request of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans maintained or sponsored by Shire or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, together with his or her respective heirs, executors and
administrators, an " **Indemnified Party** "), against all costs and expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement
amounts paid in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit or
proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Date), whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to any action or omission in such persons capacity as a director or officer
of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director or officer of Shire
or any of its Subsidiaries, serving at the request of Shire or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another
corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or
sponsored by Shire or any of its Subsidiaries (including actions or omissions
arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Delaware Merger Agreement
or this Agreement). It is expressly agreed that the rights of each Indemnified
Party under this clause 8 shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of,
any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of
incorporation, articles of association and bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

8.2 For six years after the Effective Date, New AbbVie shall honour and
fulfill provisions in New AbbVies and each Subsidiary of New AbbVies
certificates of incorporation, articles of association and bylaws (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the New AbbVie) existing as of
the date hereof regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Date.

 



 

8.3 With effect from the Effective Date, New AbbVie shall purchase directors
and officers liability insurance cover "tail" policies for both current and
former directors and officers of Shire and any of its Subsidiaries, including
directors or officers who retire or whose employment is terminated as a result
of the Acquisition, for acts or omissions up to and including the Effective
Date, in the form of runoff cover for a period of six years following the
Effective Date. Such "tail" policies shall be with reputable insurer(s) and
provide cover, in terms of amount and breadth, at least as much as that
provided under Shires directors and officers liability insurance as at the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall New
AbbVie spend or commit to spend for such "tail" policies an amount in
aggregate in excess of the 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof by Shire for directors and officers liability insurance (the " **Base
Premium** "), and if the cost of such "tail" policies exceeds such amount, New
AbbVie shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for an
aggregate cost not exceeding the Base Premium

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.** ** ****SWITCHING TO AN OFFER**

 



 

9.1 AbbVie shall be entitled, with the consent of the Panel, to implement the
Acquisition by way of the Offer rather than the Scheme (such an election, a "
**Switch** ") only where:

apply (an " **Agreed Switch** "); or

 



 

9.1.2 Shire makes a Shire Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

9.2 In the event of an Agreed Switch:

 



 

9.2.1 the acceptance condition to the Offer (the " **Acceptance Condition** ")
shall be set at 90 per cent. (or such lesser percentage as may be agreed
between the Parties after, to the extent necessary, consultation with the
Panel, being in any case more than fifty per cent. of the Shire Shares) of the
Shire Shares to which the Offer relates;

 



 

9.2.2 AbbVie shall not take any actions which would cause the Offer not to
proceed, to lapse or to be withdrawn in each case for non-fulfilment of the
Acceptance Condition prior to the 60th day after publication of the Offer
Document and AbbVie shall ensure that the Offer remains open until such time;

 



 

9.2.3 AbbVie shall not waive, treat as fulfilled or otherwise amend the
Acceptance Condition without the prior written consent of Shire where to do so
would result in Shire Shareholders holding equal to or less than of 20% of New
AbbVie upon completion of the Merger;

 



 

9.2.4 AbbVie shall ensure that the only conditions of the Offer shall be the
Conditions (unless the parties agree otherwise);

 



 

9.2.5 AbbVie shall keep Shire informed, on a regular basis and in any event by
the next Business Day following a request from Shire of the number of Shire
Shareholders that have validly returned their acceptance or withdrawal forms
or incorrectly completed their withdrawal or acceptance forms and the identity
of such shareholders; and

 



 

9.2.6 as soon as reasonably practicable following such event or circumstance,
provide reasonable details of the event which has occurred or circumstance
which has arisen which AbbVie considers is sufficiently material for the Panel
to permit AbbVie to invoke any of the Conditions.

 



 

9.3 In the event of any Switch, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall be
construed as far as possible to give effect to the intentions of the Parties
under this Agreement.

shall cease forthwith, if:

 



      
 

 



 

10.1.1 the Scheme (or the Offer as the case may be) is withdrawn or lapses
(other than where such lapse or withdrawal is a result of the exercise by

Days by a Rule 2.7 announcement made by AbbVie or a person acting in concert

and all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall cease
forthwith) if:

 



 

10.2.1 either Condition 1(a) or 1(b) has been invoked by AbbVie in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

10.2.2 Shire makes a Shire Adverse Recommendation Change; or

Shares shall not have occurred at the AbbVie Shareholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of the
Delaware Merger Agreement is taken.

considering, negotiating and implementing this Agreement and the transactions
and other actions contemplated by this Agreement, AbbVie undertakes that if,
prior to the termination of this Agreement, an Adverse Shareholder Vote occurs
in circumstances where the Break Fee is not payable (a " **Cost Reimbursement
Event** "), then AbbVie will make a payment (the " **Cost Reimbursement
Payment** ") to Shire in order to reimburse and compensate Shire for all of
its and its subsidiaries reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and its and their
costs, fees, losses and charges incurred directly or indirectly in connection
with the consideration, negotiation and implementation of this Agreement and
the transactions and other actions contemplated by this Agreement (together "
**Costs** ") in an amount in cash in US Dollars that is equal to the aggregate
of the Costs up to a maximum amount of one per cent of the product of the
indicative value of the cash and shares to be delivered per Shire Share
multiplied by the number of issued Shire shares all as set forth in Annex A
and converted pursuant to the exchange rate in Annex B; provided that the
parties agree that the Costs shall be deemed to be no less than $500 million
and a payment of $500 million in cash in respect of Costs shall be due to
Shire within seven days of the occurrence of a Cost Reimbursement Event
without any action being required of Shire.

 **SCHEDULE 3**

 



 

 **EMPLOYEE AND SHARE PLAN ARRANGEMENTS**

 



 

 **General**

 



 

1. Subject to applicable confidentiality, legal and regulatory requirements, Shire agrees to co-operate with and provide such details to AbbVie in relation to the Shire employee incentive arrangements as AbbVie may reasonably request in order to plan and make appropriate proposals to the participants in the Shire employee incentive arrangements, as provided for in Rule 15 of the Code, including the proposals as set out in paragraphs 4 to 12 below (the " **Proposals** "). The parties agree that such Proposals will be sent to participants as soon as practicable after the Scheme Document (or Offer Document, as applicable) is published. AbbVie agrees that the terms of such communications will be agreed with Shire before they are despatched (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld). If requested by Shire, the Proposals (or some of them) will take the form of a joint proposal to participants from Shire and AbbVie.

 



 

2. Shire agrees that, save for

 



 

(i) exercise of the discretion referred to in paragraph 6 below; and

 



 

(ii) exercise of any discretion to treat any person as a good leaver (however
defined) on termination of their employment prior to the Effective Date,

 



 

in advance of the exercise of any discretion provided for under any of the
Shire employee incentive arrangements by the Shire Directors or Shires
Remuneration Committee, Shire shall notify AbbVie that such discretion is
being considered by the Shire Directors or Shires Remuneration Committee, as
appropriate, and Shire agrees that AbbVie shall be entitled to make
representations to the relevant body, which the relevant body shall consider
prior to exercising any discretion. AbbVie agrees that neither the Shire
Directors nor Shires Remuneration Committee shall be bound to act in
accordance with AbbVies representation.

 



 

3. AbbVie and Shire agree that Shire shall propose an amendment to the Shire articles of association by the adoption and inclusion of a new article (to be set out in the notice of the Shire general meeting) under which, with effect from the Scheme becoming effective, Shire Shares which are issued after the record date in respect of the Scheme as a result of the exercise of rights under the Shire employee incentive arrangements will, to the extent not otherwise acquired under the Scheme, be transferred to New AbbVie for the same consideration as is payable to shareholders under the Scheme.

 



 

 **Shire Portfolio Share Plan ("PSP")**

 



 

4. The Proposals to participants in the PSP will take the form of their PSP awards vesting at the Effective Date on a pro rata basis, calculated in accordance with the PSP rules applicable on a change of control, but with those PSP awards that do not so vest being rolled over into replacement awards over shares in New AbbVie of equivalent value (" **Rollover Awards** "). These replacement awards will continue to vest in future on the same time schedule and otherwise, save as referred to below, subject to the same terms as the Shire awards which they replace.

 



      
 

 



 

5. In circumstances where (i) the employment of the holder of a Rollover Award is terminated by Shire (or his/her relevant employer within the Shire Group or the New AbbVie Group, as appropriate) for any reason other than for Cause, or (ii) the employee terminates his or her employment for Good Reason, within 12 months after the Effective Date, his/her Rollover Awards will vest in full (without time pro-rating). Dr Ornskovs Rollover Awards will also vest in full (without time pro-rating) on or following 30 June 2015 on the day upon which notice of termination of Dr Ornskovs employment is given by Shire (or his employer within the Shire Group or the New AbbVie Group, as appropriate) or on the date upon which notice is given by Dr Ornskov to terminate his employment for any reason.

 



 

6. The parties agree that the Remuneration Committee of Shire may, if it so decides in respect of any PSP vesting which occurs in connection with the Scheme sanction (or Offer becoming effective), determine that all performance conditions attaching to awards under the PSP have been satisfied. No such determination may be made where a vesting occurs otherwise than in connection with the Scheme sanction (or Offer becoming effective). Where the existing award was subject to performance conditions, Rollover Award will be subject to equivalent performance conditions. Those performance conditions will be based on parameters which are appropriate for New AbbVie and will be set on the basis that they are expected to be no easier and no more difficult to achieve than the performance conditions applying to the equivalent existing award and will be tested on the same timetable as the performance conditions applying to the existing award.

 



 

 **Deferred Shares**

 



 

7. One-off deferred share awards made on appointment or promotion of individuals (none of which are subject to performance conditions) will vest in accordance with their terms.

 



 

 **Shire Sharesave Scheme ("Sharesave")**

 



 

8. The Proposals to Sharesave optionholders will be to either exercise their options on or following the change of control of Shire in accordance with the Sharesave rules or to exchange their Sharesave options for replacement options over shares in New AbbVie, in accordance with the standard rollover rules of the Sharesave plan.

 



 

 **Shire Employee Stock Performance Plan ("ESPP")**

 



 

9. To the extent offering periods have not concluded prior to the Scheme (or Offer) becoming effective, such offering periods will be terminated prior to completion and options will be exercised prior to, but conditional upon, Scheme (or Offer) becoming effective such that Shire Shares will be purchased in accordance with the ESPP plan terms. Participants in the French Sub-Plan will be treated, to the extent practicable, consistently with US participants in the ESPP.

 



 

 **Irish Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Irish ESPP")**

 



 

10. Participants in the Irish ESPP will be treated, to the extent practicable, consistently with participants in the Sharesave plan.

 



 

 **Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("EAIP")**

 



 

11. Deferred shares held under the EAIP will be released to participants immediately prior to the Effective Date.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Legacy option arrangements**

 



 

12. All options under the Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme are already exercisable. They will lapse if not exercised within a period (likely to be one month) following the Effective Date. Optionholders will have the opportunity prior to, or during this exercise window following, the Scheme (or Offer) becoming effective to exercise their options. A cashless exercise facility will be made available to optionholders exercising their options.

 



 

 **2014 Incentive Plans**

 



 

13. (i) To the extent not previously paid by the Shire Group prior to the Effective Date, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Date, Shire or the relevant member of the Shire Group shall make a cash payment to each employee of the Shire Group who is a participant in the Shire Executive Annual Incentive Plan or the Shire Annual Incentive Plan (each, an " **Annual Bonus Plan** ") as at the Effective Date, in full satisfaction of each such employees rights under such plan, in an amount equal to the amount determined by Shire prior to the Effective Date to be payable to such employee with respect to the 2014 calendar year under the Annual Bonus Plans, based on Shires actual performance through the December 31, 2014 or a best estimate of Shires performance to the Effective Date (if earlier).

 



 

(ii) To the extent not previously paid prior to the Effective Date, each
employee of the Shire Group who participates in a cash incentive plan other
than the Annual Bonus Plans (each, an " **Incentive Plan** ") as at the
Effective Date will be eligible to receive a payment under the terms of such
Incentive Plan for the performance period in which the Effective Date falls,
if the employee remains employed by the New AbbVie Group through the required
date set forth in such Incentive Plan or, where the employment of such
employee has been terminated by Shire (or his/her relevant employer within the
Shire Group or the New AbbVie Group, as appropriate) for any reason other than
for Cause, such employee shall receive any accrued benefits under the relevant
Incentive Plan to the date of termination.

 



 

(iii) In the event the Effective Date occurs prior to December 31, 2014, each
Incentive Plan will continue to be maintained in accordance with the terms
thereof through December 31, 2014. Payments under the Incentive Plans will in
all cases be determined in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Plans
and Shires historical practices for making such payments and will reflect a
participants individual targets (as applicable).

 



 

 **Excise Tax**

 



 

14. To the extent any Shire "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 4985 of the U.S. Code) becomes subject to an excise tax under Section 4985 of the U.S. Code on the value of "specified stock compensation" (as defined in Section 4985 of the U.S. Code) in connection with the Merger, Shire will provide each such individual with a payment with respect to the excise tax, so that, on a net after-tax basis, he or she would be in the same position as if no such excise tax had applied. These amounts would be paid following the Effective Date, prior to the date the excise tax becomes due and payable.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Employee Trust**

 



 

15. Shire agrees to recommend to the trustee of the Shire Employee Benefit Trust that the trustee will, in priority to the issue of Shares by Shire, use the Shares currently comprised in the trust to satisfy any vesting and/or exercise of options and/or awards under any of the Shire employee incentive arrangements which occurs following the date of this agreement.

 



 

 **Retention Arrangements**

 



 

16. The parties agree that Shire shall be permitted to implement employee retention arrangements on the terms herein and as may otherwise be agreed between Shire and AbbVie for such key Shire employees (the " **Key Shire Employees** ") as have been agreed in advance between Shire and AbbVie (the " **Key Retention Award Arrangements** "). The Key Retention Award Arrangements shall prescribe that, to be eligible to receive the award, the relevant Key Shire Employee must, subject to the terms set out in paragraph 17 below, remain in the active employment of Shire (or an appropriate alternative employer within the New AbbVie Group) until 30 June 2015 (the " **Retention Date** "). Where due, such awards will be payable (less any legally required deductions) within 30 days after the Retention Date.

 



 

17. In circumstances where the employment of a Key Shire Employee:

 



 

(i) is terminated by Shire (or his/her relevant employer within the Shire
Group or the New AbbVie Group, as appropriate) for any reason other than for
Cause;

 



 

(ii) terminates by reason of death or disability; or

 



 

(iii) is terminated by the Key Shire Employee for a Good Reason,

 



 

(each a " **Permitted Acceleration Event** "), in any which case prior to the
Retention Date, then the applicable award shall instead be payable in full
within 30 days after the Permitted Acceleration Event. In all other
circumstances where the employment of a relevant Key Shire Employee terminates
prior to the Retention Date, the relevant Key Shire Employee shall immediately
forfeit the right to receive any payment under or in respect of the Key
Retention Award Arrangements.

 



 

18. Shire agrees to consult with AbbVie in connection with the content of any submission made to the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in connection with the arrangements set out in paragraphs 16 to 17 and that no such submission shall be made without AbbVies prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

19. AbbVie and Shire agree that New AbbVie shall, in due course, consider implementing employee retention arrangements in respect of such other employees of the New AbbVie Group as New AbbVie shall consider appropriate and necessary, to take effect after the Effective Date.

 



 

 **Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits**

 



 

20. AbbVie agrees that New AbbVie shall, at a minimum, for the 12-month period immediately following the Effective Date:

 



 

(i) in respect of each employee of the Shire Group (as identified immediately
preceding the Scheme (or Offer) becoming effective) who remains in employment

 



      
 

 



 

within the New AbbVie Group, maintain base salary and bonus opportunity at
existing levels; and

 



 

(ii) (subject to the below) provide a benefits package which is substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the existing benefits available to the
employees of Shire as at the date of this Agreement.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of (ii) above, the terms of any
separation or severance pay plan or arrangement which may apply in respect of
any such employee shall not be considered to be a "benefit" for these
purposes.

 



 

 **Definitions**

 



 

21. " **Cause** " means the following: (A) material breach by the employee of the terms and conditions of the employees employment, including, but not limited to: (i) material breach by the employee of Shires or New AbbVies (as applicable) code of business conduct; (ii) material breach by the employee of the employees employment agreement (if any); (iii) commission by the employee of an act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with the employees duties or in the course of the employees employment; (iv) wrongful disclosure by the employee of secret processes or confidential information of the Shire Group or the New AbbVie Group; or (v) failure by the employee to substantially perform the duties of the employees employment (other than any such failure resulting from the employees disability); or (B) to the extent permitted by applicable law, engagement by the employee, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the employee or others, in any activity, employment or business which is competitive with the Shire Group, AbbVie Group or New AbbVie Group.

 



 

22. " **Good Reason** " means as a result of (i) any material reduction in an employees base salary or target incentive opportunity, or (ii) a relocation in the principal place of an employees employment that increases his or her daily commute by more than 50 miles from that immediately prior to the Effective Date.

 



 

23. " **New AbbVie Group** " means New AbbVie and its subsidiaries from time to time.

first above written.

Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares), and all rights in respect
thereof, shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, one ordinary

Limited Common Shares with a record and payment date prior to the surrender of
such Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 4.10 (such certificates for shares of AbbVie Limited Common Shares,
together with the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ ").

 



 

Section 4.3 _Certificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate, (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall notify holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger and specify that delivery shall be effected, and
that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in

surrender of the Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.8) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for delivery of the
Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.8) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with such instructions, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (x)
certificates (or, at AbbVie Limiteds option, uncertificated shares)

represented by such holders Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
4.1, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled, and (y)
a check in an amount of United States dollars equal to (i) any cash in lieu of
fractional Shares pursuant to Section 4.10 plus (ii) cash dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
4.5, in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.9 and without interest thereon.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time, AbbVie
Limited shall cause the Exchange Agent to (a) mail to each holder of
Uncertificated Shares materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of
the Merger and the conversion of their Shares into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and (b) deliver (i) in registered form to each holder of
Uncertificated Shares that number of AbbVie Limited Common Shares that such

 



      
 

 



 

holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such Uncertificated Share
pursuant to Section 4.1 and (ii) a check in an amount of United States dollars
equal to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional Shares pursuant to Section 4.10,
plus (B) cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 4.5 below, in each case, after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.9 and without interest
thereon.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares;
Voting_.

 



 

(a) All AbbVie Limited Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by AbbVie Limited in respect of the AbbVie
Limited Common Shares, the record date for which is after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all AbbVie Limited Common Shares issued in the Merger. The Exchange Agent
shall hold any AbbVie Limited Common Shares in respect of unsurrendered
Certificates in trust for the holder of such Certificate until such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.8)
has been surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the AbbVie Limited Common
Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.8)
has been surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. Subject
to applicable Law and the provisions of this Article IV, following surrender
of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.8), there shall be delivered to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of AbbVie Limited Common Shares in
exchange therefore, and, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 4.9 and without interest thereon, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to such AbbVie Limited Common Shares and not
theretofore paid and any cash in lieu of fractional Shares pursuant to Section
4.10 and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such AbbVie Limited Common Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time, but with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender.

 



 

(b) Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to
direct the Exchange Agent how to vote the AbbVie Limited Common Shares
represented by such unsurrendered Certificates at any meeting of AbbVie
Limited stockholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time the
number of whole AbbVie Limited Common Shares represented by such Certificates,
regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any AbbVie
Limited Common Shares) which has not been transferred to the holders of Shares
as of the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
AbbVie Limited or its designee, upon demand. Any holder of Certificates (as
applicable) who has not theretofore complied with this

 



      
 

 



 

Article IV prior to the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall
thereafter look only to AbbVie Limited for delivery of any certificates for
AbbVie Limited Common Shares and payment of any dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, AbbVie
Limited, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and compliance with the
replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent including, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by AbbVie Limited as
indemnity against any claim with respect to such Certificate that may be made
against it, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to such Person (or its designee) in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the AbbVie Limited Common Shares and
any dividends and other distributions in respect of the AbbVie Limited Common
Shares that would have been delivered pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in Section 4.9) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered. If delivery of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such delivery shall have paid to the Exchange Agent
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the record holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of AbbVie Limited and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by AbbVie
Limited or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (a) shall be remitted by AbbVie Limited or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such
Shares (which have been converted into AbbVie Limited Common Shares) in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or AbbVie Limited, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of AbbVie Limited Common Shares will be issued
and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of AbbVie
Limited Common Shares but for this Section 4.10 shall be entitled to receive a
cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the
Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a
share of AbbVie Limited Common Shares based on net proceeds from the sale by
the Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Agent on behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional shares of AbbVie
Limited Common Stock that such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive.
Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five business days
after the date upon which the Certificate(s) (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu
of the Certificates(s) as provided in Section 4.8) that would otherwise result
in the delivery of such fractional shares of AbbVie Limited Common Shares have
been received by the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares,
promptly after the Effective Time.
