CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

2.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Date, TSH will be merged with and into IBKC in accordance with this
Agreement and the BCL.

2.2 Conversion of TSH Common Stock.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(b), at the Effective Date each
outstanding share of TSH Common Stock will be converted into the right to
receive shares of IBKC Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio and cash in
lieu of fractional shares (such number of shares of IBKC Common Stock and cash
in lieu of fractional shares is hereinafter referred to as the
"Merger Consideration"), as set forth below:



     | (i) | 1.162 shares of IBKC Common Stock (to the nearest thousandth
of a share) to be exchanged for each share of TSH Common Stock and cash
(without interest) payable with respect to any fractional share of IBKC Common
Stock (as determined below); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Market Value is greater than $68.20 per share, the
adjusted Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (to the nearest thousandth of
a share) obtained by dividing $79.25 by the Market Value; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | if the Market Value is less than $55.80 per share, the
adjusted Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (to the nearest thousandth of
a share) obtained by dividing $64.84 by the Market Value; plus 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | in lieu of issuing any fractional share of IBKC Common
Stock which would otherwise be distributable to a TSH shareholder as
determined following application of Section 2.2(a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii)
above, each holder of TSH Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
thereto, after aggregating into whole shares all fractional shares of IBKC
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled by virtue of the Merger, upon
surrender of the Certificate(s) which represented TSH Common Stock, will
receive, without interest, cash equal to such fractional share multiplied by
the Market Value. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) Shares of TSH Common Stock that are held by TSH and any TSH Subsidiary
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or pursuant to debts
previously contracted) shall not be considered to be outstanding and shall be
cancelled (and not converted) by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Date
and without any further action by any party.

 

(c) If, before the Effective Date, IBKC should split, reclassify, recapitalize
or combine the IBKC Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in IBKC Common
Stock, or otherwise change the IBKC Common Stock into any other securities, or
make any other stock dividend or distribution in respect of the outstanding
IBKC Common Stock, and the record date therefore is prior to the Effective
Date, then the Exchange Ratio will be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted to reflect such split, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, stock dividend or other distribution or change.

 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Date, IBKC shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of TSH Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2,
certificates representing the shares of IBKC Common Stock and the estimated
amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of IBKC Common Stock.
After the Effective Date, each holder of TSH Common Stock, upon surrender of
such holders Certificates in accordance herewith, will be entitled to receive
the shares of

 



\- 5 -  IBKC Common Stock and cash for fractional shares into which such holders
shares have been converted, less any applicable tax withholding. Until then,
each Certificate for TSH Common Stock will represent the number of whole
shares of IBKC Common Stock and cash into which the shares of TSH Common Stock
represented thereby were converted, except that IBKC may refuse to pay any
dividend or other distribution payable to holders of any unsurrendered
Certificate for TSH Common Stock (without any interest thereon) until
surrender. Whether or not a Certificate for TSH Common Stock is surrendered,
after the Effective Date it will represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share represented by such Certificate.

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Date, IBKC or the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates, or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent, to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of TSH Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.2.
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, within
three (3) Business Days thereafter, in exchange therefore, as applicable, (i)
a certificate representing that number of shares of IBKC Common Stock to which
such former holder of TSH Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) a check representing that amount of cash for
fractional shares to which such former holder of TSH Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as IBKC may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

(g) If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying
letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a
condition of the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such
Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the
record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for
transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of the
Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to
do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(a) _Schedule 2.3(a)_ sets forth all outstanding options to purchase shares of
TSH Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement, whether or not then vested
or exercisable (the "TSH Options"), including the names of the holders

thereof. TSH shall take all actions necessary prior to the Effective Date, to
cause each TSH Option, by reason of the Merger, to be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive in cash an amount (subject to required tax
withholdings) equal to the difference between (i) the average of the twenty-
four (24) hour daily weighted average trading prices of the IBKC Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as calculated by Bloomberg Screen AQR) on
each of the two (2) trading days ending one (1) Business Day prior to the
Effective Date, multiplied by the number of shares of TSH Common Stock
subject to such TSH Option, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the
exercise price per share of the TSH Option multiplied by the number of shares
of TSH Common Stock subject to such TSH Option (the "Option Payment").

(b) In connection with such cancellation and conversion, prior to the receipt
of the Option Payment, each holder of a TSH Option shall execute a
cancellation agreement, substantially in the form of _Schedule 2.3(b)_.

herein, as of the Effective Date, the restrictions on each share of
TSH Restricted Stock under the TSH stock benefit plans shall, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, TSH or TFB, lapse, and each share of
TSH Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such
time, and each such share of TSH Restricted Stock will be treated at the
Closing the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same
conditions, as each share of TSH Common Stock not subject to any restrictions.

receive a severance payment from IBKC equal to the greater of the payment to
which the employee would be entitled under TSHs severance policies as in
effect as of the date hereof and the severance policies and procedures of

such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate
in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees and their
dependents of IBKC and IBERIABANK. In the event IBKC terminates any TSH health
plan or consolidates any TSH health plan with any IBKC health plan,

and TFB (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in TSHs certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or in the similar governing documents of TFB as in
effect as of the date hereof

 



\- 8 -  (including without limitation the right to the advancement of expenses) with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Date shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Date; _provided,
however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim, suit,
proceeding, investigation, or other action ("Claim") asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim;
_provided further_ , however, that nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a)
shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation, consolidation or merger of TSH
or TFB, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on
liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such
liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which may be
asserted against IBKC. Nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a) shall be
deemed to preclude any rights to indemnification or limitations on liability
provided in TSHs articles of incorporation or the similar
governing documents of TFB with respect to matters occurring subsequent to
the Effective Date to the extent that the provisions establishing such rights
or limitations are not otherwise amended to the contrary prior to the
Effective Date.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 4.4,
upon learning of any claim, shall notify IBKC thereof in writing as promptly
as is practicable; provided, however, that failure to so notify IBKC shall not
relieve IBKC and IBERIABANK from any liability that would otherwise arise
under this Section 4.4 except to the extent such failure prejudices IBKC or
IBERIABANK. IBKC and IBERIABANK shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and shall not be liable for any expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if IBKC
and IBERIABANK do not assume or continue to pursue such defense, or counsel
for the Indemnified Party advises in writing that issues raise conflicts of
interest between IBKC and IBERIABANK and the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party
(and reasonably satisfactory to IBKC) at IBKCs and IBERIABANKs expense;
provided, however, that (i) IBKC and IBERIABANK shall not be obligated to pay
for more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
except as may be required due to conflicts of interest; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate (to the extent reasonably appropriate under the
circumstances) in the defense of any such claim; and (iii) IBKC and
IBERIABANK shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the prior
written consent of IBKC, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(c) TSH and TFB will, for total premiums not to exceed 150% of the current
annual premium in effect for TSH and TFB management liability (the "Maximum
Amount"), purchase a continuation of their current management liability

officers, other employees or independent contractors of, or dependents,
spouses or other beneficiaries of any of such directors, officers, other
employees or independent contractors of, any of the Warrantor Companies

or other beneficiaries of any of such directors or officers of, TSH and TFB,
which employment and consulting agreements are, with respect to TSH and
TFB, included in the term "Warrantor Benefit Plans" as defined above. Any of
the Warrantor Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as
a "Warrantor ERISA Plan". No Warrantor has participated in or been a member

consolidated basis. With respect to the Warrantor Benefit Plans, no event has

condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which the Warrantor

event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be filed
for any Warrantor ERISA Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA within the
12-month period ending on the date of this Agreement. No Warrantor

which is subject to Title IV of ERISA pursuant to Section 401(a)(20) of the
Code.

 

(c) Except as set forth on its respective _Schedule 5.6(c)_ , no Warrantor
ERISA Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA has any "unfunded current
liability," as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the
present fair market value of the assets of each such plan exceeds the plans
"benefit liabilities", as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA, when determined under actuarial factors that would apply if the plan
terminated as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with all applicable
legal requirements.

 

5.7 Material Contracts.

 

(a) Except as set forth on its respective _Schedule 5.7(a)_ , none of the

and that was not so filed (each such contract, agreement or amendment, a
"Warrantor Material Contract").

 

(b) Except as set forth on its respective _Schedule 5.7(b)_ , no Warrantor
Company is in default under any Warrantor Material Contract, and there has

paragraph of Section V, as applicable, there is or is reasonably likely to be
a Material Adverse Effect, except that the representations and warranties in
Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 shall be true and correct in all respects.
TSHs representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement

of them.

 

5.17 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since September 30, 2013, Warrantor
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, have not
suffered any change in any respect that has had or is reasonably likely to

there any strike or other labor dispute involving Warrantor or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or threatened.

benefits for any class of its employees or officers (unless such change is
required by applicable law or, in the opinion of counsel, is necessary or
advisable to maintain the tax qualification of any plan under which the

6.2 Conduct of Business  Affirmative Covenants. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Date or earlier termination of this
Agreement, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement

to in writing by the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), Warrantor shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i)
conduct its business in the ordinary course of business in all material
respects; provided, that IBKC or any of its Subsidiaries shall not be
precluded from making any acquisition or investment in any other Person, (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business
organization, employees and advantageous business relationships, and (iii)
take no other action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or
materially delay the ability of either IBKC or TSH to obtain any necessary
approvals of any Regulatory Authorities required for the transactions
contemplated hereby or to perform its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.3 Adverse Changes in Condition. Each Warrantor shall give written notice
promptly to the other Warrantor concerning (i) any event which has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such Warrantor, or
(ii) the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
known to such Warrantor

 



\- 17 -  which would have needed to be reported in a Schedule hereunder if it had
occurred or been pending on or prior to the date of this Agreement, or which
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of such Warrantor contained herein or that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the timely
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Warrantor
shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or to promptly remedy the
same.

6.4 Investigation and Confidentiality.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Date, TSH will keep IBKC promptly advised of all
developments which may reasonably result in a Material Adverse Effect
relevant to its business and to the consummation of the Merger, and IBKC may
make or cause to be made such investigation, if any, of the business,
properties, operations and financial and legal condition of TSH and its
Subsidiaries as IBKC reasonably deems necessary or advisable to familiarize
itself and its advisors with such Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal
operations.

(b) Each Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor and the other
Warrantors respective advisors with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to its business, properties and employees as
the other Warrantor shall from time to time reasonably request. No
investigation by one Warrantor shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other Warrantor and, subject to Section 9.3 of this
Agreement, each such representation and warranty shall survive any such
investigation. Each Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor with
all information necessary to expedite pre-conversion planning and
implementation, including, but not limited to, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to plan, make effective and
consummate systems and branch conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither party hereto shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate its attorney-client
privilege or violate or prejudice the rights of any customer or contravene
any law, rule, regulation, order or judgment, nor to disclose board minutes of
any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, or any Acquisition Proposal. Each Warrantor shall
maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it
by the other Warrantor in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality
agreement dated October 4, 2013 between the Warrantors (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). 

6.5 Reports. From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective
Date or the termination of this Agreement, each Warrantor shall, IBKC shall

after the same are filed.

6.6 Dividends. From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective
Date or the termination of this Agreement, TSH shall not declare or pay any

TSH may (to the extent legally able to do so), but shall not be obligated to,
declare and pay consistent with past practices and prior to the Effective
Date, a quarterly cash dividend (in an amount per share not to exceed the
amount disclosed in _Schedule 6.6_ ). With respect to the fiscal quarter of
the Effective Date, TSH shall not pay any dividend or other distribution if
IBKC shall declare and pay a dividend or other distribution in such fiscal
quarter that would be payable to former TSH shareholders after the Effective
Date.

 

6.7 Capital Stock. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
(including Section 6.1(e) hereof), or as set forth on  _Schedule 6.7_ ,
without the prior written consent of IBKC, from the date of this Agreement to
the earlier of the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement, TSH
shall not, and shall not enter into any agreement to, issue, sell,
or otherwise permit to become outstanding any additional shares of TSH Common
Stock or any other capital stock of TSH and any Subsidiary of TSH, or any
stock appreciation rights, or any option, warrant, conversion or other right
to acquire any such stock, or any security convertible into any such stock
except for the issuance of TSH Common Stock upon the exercise of stock
options.

 



\- 18 - 6.8 Certain Actions.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.8(d) of this Agreement, TSH agrees that, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Date or the
termination of this Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any discussion with or provide
any confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement or propose publicly or agree to do
any of the foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) TSH agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore (other than IBKC) with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal informing them that the Board of Directors no
longer seeks the making of any Acquisition Proposals.

(c) TSH agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its
directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.8.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.8(a) of this Agreement, if
any Person after the date of this Agreement submits to TSHs board of
directors an unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal, and
TSHs board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after receipt
of advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in
discussions with such Person concerning such Acquisition Proposal may cause
TSHs board of directors to breach its fiduciary duties to TSH and its
shareholders, and after consultation with its financial advisor, then, in such
case, (i) TSH may (A) furnish information about its business to such Person
under protection of an appropriate confidentiality agreement
containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public
written or oral information furnished to such Person, provided that TSH must
contemporaneously furnish to IBKC all such non-public information furnished to
such Person, and (B) negotiate and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person; and (ii) if TSHs board of directors determines
that such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (defined below),
TSHs board of directors may (subject to the provisions of this Section 6.8)
(A) withdraw or adversely modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger
and recommend such Superior Proposal or (B) terminate this Agreement, in each
case, (i) at any time after two (2) Business Days following IBKCs receipt of
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising IBKC that TSHs
board of directors has received a Superior Proposal, comprehensively
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
(ii) subject to IBKCs Right of First Refusal (defined below). In the event
IBKC elects not to exercise the Right of First Refusal, TSH shall provide IBKC
with a final written notice of acceptance before or simultaneous with
accepting any Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, and otherwise on
terms which TSHs board of directors determines, after consultation with its
financial advisor, are materially more favorable to TSHs shareholders (in
their capacities as shareholders) from a financial point of view than the
Merger after giving effect to the provisions of Section 9.2 (or other revised
proposal submitted by IBKC). For the purposes of this Section 6.8(d), an
Acquisition Proposal shall be " _bona_ _fide_ " if the board of directors of
TSH reasonably determines that the Person submitting such Acquisition Proposal
is capable, from a financial, regulatory and other appropriate perspectives,
of consummating such Acquisition Proposal on the terms proposed. 

(e) IBKC shall have the right ("Right of First Refusal") for two (2) Business
Days after receipt of Notice of Superior Proposal to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable TSH to proceed with
the Merger on the basis of such adjusted terms. If IBKC fails to exercise such
Right of First Refusal within the time herein specified, TSH shall be at
liberty to accept the Superior Proposal, subject to the obligations of TSH
pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof.

 



\- 19 - 6.9 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and its fiduciary duties under applicable law, each
Warrantor agrees to use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
and regulations to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Bank Plan of Merger, including, without limitation, using its best
efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Warrantor shall use, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain
consents of all third parties and governmental bodies necessary or desirable
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
This Section 6.9 shall not require either Warrantor to waive any condition to
such Warrantors obligation to consummate the Merger.

 

6.10 Operating Functions. TSH and TFB shall cooperate with IBKC and IBERIABANK
in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of the
parties and the operation of TFB after the Merger, and in preparing for the

6.11 Preservation of Business. TSH shall use its reasonable best efforts to
preserve the possession and control of all of TSHs and TFBs assets (other

do nothing knowingly to impair their ability keep and preserve their
businesses as they exist on the date hereof. From the date hereof until the
Effective Date, TFB (i) shall notify IBERIABANK prior to establishing the
rates to be paid by TFB on its deposit accounts, (ii) shall review with
IBERIABANK biweekly conduct of TSHs loan approval process, and (iii) shall
notify IBERIABANK promptly of any change to the TSH Credits identified in
_Schedule 5.14(a)_ hereto.

 

6.12 Issuance of IBKC Common Stock. IBKC shall, prior to the Closing, take
such action as is required to authorize and reserve for issuance the IBKC
Common Stock to the shareholders of TSH pursuant to the Merger, and to permit
such IBKC Common Stock to be approved for listing and quotation on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market.

 

6.13 Support Agreements. TSH has delivered, or will deliver, to IBKC Support
Agreements executed by TSHs directors and executive officers, substantially
in the form of _Exhibit II_ , pursuant to which certain TSH directors will be
invited to join IBERIABANKs local advisory board.

 

6.14 Bank Merger. Warrantor will, and will cause its banking subsidiary to,
take such action as shall reasonably be deemed necessary or advisable to

faith to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but

the case may be), subject to IBKCs discretion: (i) to reject any such
rollover if it may reasonably jeopardize the qualified status of

rollovers of plan loans. In the case of a conflict between the terms of this

IBKC the Section 16 Information reasonably in advance of the Effective Date,

conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of TSH
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the 1934 Act. " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information accurate in

SECTION VIII.

 

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS TO CONSUMMATE

 

The obligation of each Warrantor to consummate the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions, unless waived by such party
pursuant to Section 10.5 of this Agreement:

8.1 Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
other Warrantor set forth or referred to in this Agreement shall be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the time of the Closing
with the same effect as though all such representations and warranties had
been made on and as of the time of the Closing, in each case subject to the
standard set forth in Section 5.10 hereof, except (i) for any such
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, which shall be
true and correct as of such date or (ii) as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement.

8.2 Performance of Agreements and Covenants. Each and all of the agreements
and covenants of the other Warrantor to be performed and complied with
pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby prior
to the time of the Closing shall have been duly performed and complied with by
it in all material respects.

8.3 Certificates. Each Warrantor shall have delivered to the other Warrantor a
certificate, dated as of the date of the Closing and signed on its behalf by
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, to the effect
that the conditions of its obligations set forth in Section 8.1 and Section
8.2 of this Agreement with respect to it have been satisfied, all in such
reasonable detail as the other Warrantor shall request.

8.4 Shareholder Approval. The shareholders of TSH shall have approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, as and to the extent required by law and by the provisions of the
governing instruments of TSH, and TSH shall have furnished to IBKC certified
copies of resolutions duly adopted by its shareholders evidencing the same.

 



\- 23 - 8.5 Consents and Approvals. All material approvals and authorizations of,
filings and registrations with, and notifications to, all Regulatory
Authorities required for consummation of the Merger shall have been obtained
or made and shall be in full force and effect and all waiting periods required
by law shall have expired. Any approval obtained from any Regulatory
Authority which is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not contain any non-standard term or condition which in the
reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of IBKC so materially and
adversely affects the economic or business assumptions of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to render inadvisable the consummation of
the Merger; it being understood that a requirement to divest five (5)
or fewer branches shall not constitute such a non-standard term or condition.
To the extent that any lease, license, loan or financing agreement or other
contract or agreement to which Warrantor is a party requires the consent of or
waiver from the other party thereto as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such consent or waiver shall have been
obtained, unless the failure to obtain such consent or waiver would not,
following the Merger, have a Material Adverse Effect on such Warrantor.

8.6 Legal Proceedings. No Warrantor shall be subject to any order, decree or
injunction of a court or agency of competent jurisdiction which enjoins or
prohibits consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

8.7 Tax Matters. Each Warrantor shall have received the tax opinion addressed
to it referred to in Sections 7.3 and 7.4 of this Agreement. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 7.11(b)_ , no payments or benefits to officers of TSH and
TFB in connection with the Merger shall constitute an excess parachute payment
under Section 280G of the Code.

 

8.8 Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall be effective
under the 1933 Act, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceeding for such purpose
shall be pending before or threatened by the SEC.

 

8.9 Simultaneous Transactions. The Warrantors shall have executed all
documents and taken all such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the
Merger other than filing a certificate of merger with the Louisiana Secretary
of State as referred to in Section 7.2, and the Warrantors shall have
irrevocably authorized their agents to make such filing in its behalf.

 

8.10 NASDAQ Listing. The shares of IBKC common stock to be issued in the
Merger shall have been authorized for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market.

8.11 Exchange Agent Certificate. IBKC shall have delivered the stock
certificates and cash consideration for fractional shares of IBKC Common
Stock to the Exchange Agent on or before the Closing and irrevocably
authorized the Exchange Agent to issue the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with a letter of
transmittal to be acceptable to the parties, and the Exchange Agent shall
provide TSH with a certificate evidencing such delivery and authorization.

 

8.12 No Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2013, no event has
occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had a Material Adverse Effect on the other Warrantor.

SECTION IX.

 

TERMINATION

9.1 Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and
notwithstanding the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of TSH,
this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing:

 

(a) By mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of the Warrantors; or

 

(b) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement) in the

 



\- 24 -  event of a material breach by the other Warrantor of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of such other Warrantor contained herein which
would result in the failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in
Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Agreement, which breach cannot be or has not been
cured within forty five (45) days after the giving of a written notice to the
breaching Warrantor of such material breach; or 

(c) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor in the event that the Merger
shall not have been consummated within twelve (12) months after the date of
this Agreement except if the reason that the Merger has not been so
consummated is due to a material breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant by the party seeking to terminate; or

 

(d) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor in the event any approval of
any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been denied by final non-
appealable action of such Regulatory Authority or if any such action taken by
such Regulatory Authority is not appealed within the time limit for appeal;
or 

(e) By the Board of Directors of IBKC, in the event any such approval of any
Regulatory Authority is conditioned upon the satisfaction of any condition or
requirement that, in the opinion of IBKC, would so materially adversely affect
its business or the economic benefits of the Merger as to render consummation
of the Merger inadvisable or unduly burdensome, and the time period
for appeals and request for reconsideration has run; it being understood that
the requirement to divest five (5) or fewer branches shall not render the
Merger inadvisable or constitute an unduly burdensome condition; or

 

(f) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor, if the shareholders of TSH
fail to approve this Agreement and the Merger, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Shareholders Meeting; or

(g) By the Board of Directors of IBKC if the Board of Directors of TSH shall,
or shall have resolved to, withdraw, modify or change its recommendation to
TSHs shareholders of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger; or

 

(h) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor if the other Warrantor has
experienced, or is reasonably likely to experience, a Material Adverse
Effect, which is not remedied or cured within thirty (30) days after notice of
intention to terminate is given by the Warrantor invoking this Section 9.1(h),
which notice shall specify the nature of the matter or matters constituting
such Material Adverse Effect and which are the basis of such intention;
provided, however, that the right to terminate that is specified in such
notice of intention shall itself terminate unless notice of termination is
given by such Warrantor within fifteen (15) days following the end of such
remedial or curative period; or

(i) By the Board of Directors of TSH, pursuant to Section 6.8(d).

9.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1 of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become void and have
no effect and the parties hereto will be relieved of all obligations and
liabilities under this Agreement, except that: (i) the provision of Section IX
hereof shall survive any such termination and abandonment; (ii) a termination
pursuant to Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement shall not relieve a breaching
Warrantor from liability for any breach giving rise to such termination; and
(iii) each Warrantor shall remain obligated under, and liable for any breach
of, any of the provisions of this Agreement that survive its termination.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by IBKC pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by TSH, or (ii) by TSH pursuant to Section 9.1(i)
hereof, and in each case within twelve (12) months after the date of any such
termination TSH, without IBKCs prior written consent, accepts in a written
agreement an Acquisition Proposal, then TSH shall pay IBKC $5,000,000, which
shall be due and payable as follows: (a) $2,500,000 shall be paid not later
than the fifth Business Day following the date TSH accepts such Acquisition
Proposal, and (b) $2,500,000 shall be paid on the

 



\- 25 -  earlier of the date of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal or twelve
(12) months from the date of acceptance of the Acquisition Proposal. Upon
payment of such termination fee pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), IBKC will
not have any other rights or claims against TSH or its Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers and directors, under this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by TSH pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by IBKC, or by IBKC pursuant to Section 9.1(e)
hereof, then IBKC shall pay TSH $4,000,000 (the "IBKC Termination Fee") not
later than the fifth Business Day following the date of notice of its
termination and the reasons for such termination. Upon payment of the IBKC
Termination Fee to TSH pursuant to this Section 9.2(c), TSH will not have any
other rights or claims against IBKC or its Subsidiaries, or their respective
officers and directors, under this Agreement.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by IBKC (i) pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by TSH, or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.1(g) hereof
because the Board of Directors of TSH shall have withdrawn, modified or
changed its recommendation to TSHs shareholders (other than in the exercise
of the TSH Boards fiduciary duties after delivery to IBKC of a notice of
intention to terminate pursuant to Section 9.1(h) which is not remedied or
cured by IBKC prior to the withdrawal, modification or change), then TSH
shall pay IBKC $4,000,000 (the "TSH Termination Fee"). Upon payment of the TSH
Termination Fee to IBKC pursuant to this Section 9.2(d), IBKC will not have
any other rights or claims against TSH or its Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers and directors, under this Agreement.

9.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The respective
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements of the
Warrantors shall not survive the Effective Date, except for those covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms apply in
whole or in part after the Effective Date; provided, however, that no such
representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated or
extinguished so as to deprive any Warrantor (or any director, officer
or controlling Person thereof) of any defense in law or equity which
otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including,
without limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of any Warrantor,
the aforesaid representations, warranties and covenants being material
inducements to consummation by the Warrantors of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION X.

accountants and counsel.

fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

10.3 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement, including the exhibits and Schedules hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder,
and such agreements supersede all prior arrangements or understanding with
respect thereto, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement except for (i) the rights of shareholders of
TSH to receive the Merger Consideration following the Effective Date and (ii)
the provisions of Section 4.4, which shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Persons referenced therein.

 



\- 26 - 10.4 Amendments. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement may be amended
by a subsequent writing signed by each of the parties hereto upon the
approval of the boards of directors of such parties; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Agreement relating to the manner or basis in which
shares of TSH Common Stock will be exchanged for IBKC Common Stock shall not
be amended after the Shareholders Meeting without the requisite approval of
the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of TSH Common Stock entitled
to vote thereon. The parties hereto may, without approval of their respective
boards of directors, make such technical changes to this Agreement, not
inconsistent with the purposes hereof, as may be required to effect or
facilitate any governmental approval or acceptance of the Merger or of
this Agreement or to effect or facilitate any filing or recording required
for the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. TSH
agrees to take such reasonable actions requested by IBKC as may be reasonably
necessary to modify the structure of, or to substitute parties to (so long as
such substitute is a Subsidiary of IBKC) the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that such modification shall not change the amount, kind,
manner or basis in which shares of TSH Common Stock will be exchanged for
IBKC Common Stock or abrogate the covenants and other agreements contained in
this Agreement, result in adverse tax consequences to the shareholders of TSH,
materially delay consummation of the Merger or jeopardize the timely receipt
of approvals of a Regulatory Authority required to consummate the Merger.

10.5 Waivers. Prior to or at the Effective Date, each party hereto, acting
through its Board of Directors or chief executive officer or other authorized
officer, shall, as to such partys rights hereunder, have the right (i) to

obligations of such party under this Agreement.

10.6 No Assignment. No party hereto may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to any other Persons, without the express
written consent of the other parties and any such purported assignment without
such requisite consent shall be null and void.
