particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in this
Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply "if." Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun or
pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and to
cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, supplemented or modified, including (i) (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes and (ii) all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset" and "property" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect. References to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. In the event of any conflict between
this Agreement and any Country Transfer Agreement, the terms of this Agreement

ARTICLE II

_Closing_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities (the

 



-21-  " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz in New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the later of
(a) the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Article_
__ _ V_ and (b) the first business day of the fiscal month of Seller
following the fiscal month of Seller in which such satisfaction (or waiver)
occurs (excluding in each case those conditions intended to be satisfied at
the Closing but subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver at such time) ( _provided_ that the Closing shall not
occur prior to July 29, 2017), or on such other date as the parties hereto may
agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be deemed to occur and be
effective at 12:01 A.M., local time, on the Closing Date. The parties hereto
specifically acknowledge that time is of the essence because Sellers
intention to exit the Business is or will become known to its employees,
customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Seller. The parties
hereto further agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether the
Closing Date may occur on the first day, rather than the first business day,
of the relevant fiscal month of Seller.

SECTION 2.02. _Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity
Interests/Excluded Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_.

(a) _Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests_. Pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller will, and will cause the relevant Asset Selling Affiliates to,
in accordance with _Exhibit L_ (the " _Closing Structure_ "), sell, convey,
assign, and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept,
the Transferred Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens. Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause the relevant Asset Selling
Affiliates to, execute and deliver at the Closing a general assignment and
bill of sale substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _General
Assignment_ "), a general patent assignment substantially in the form of
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Patent Assignment_ ") and a general trademark assignment
substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Trademark Assignment_ ") and
at the Closing such other instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer
as Buyer reasonably requests (the form and substance of which shall be
mutually agreed between the parties), in each case to convey to Buyer all of
Sellers or each Asset Selling Affiliates right, title and interest in and to
the applicable Transferred Assets. In addition, pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller
will, and will cause the relevant Stock Selling Affiliates to, in accordance
with the Closing Structure, sell, convey, assign, and transfer to Buyer, and
Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept, the Transferred Equity Interests (and
will indirectly acquire and accept by means of such purchase acquisition and
acceptance, the Transferred Equity Interests in any Transferred Company that
is a subsidiary of another Transferred Company), free and clear of all Liens.
Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause the relevant Stock Selling Affiliates
to, deliver at the Closing stock certificates representing the Transferred
Equity Interests, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, to the extent
that such Transferred Equity Interests are in certificated form, and to the
extent such Transferred Equity Interests are not in certificated form,
other evidence of assignment.

(b) _Excluded Assets_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) right, title or interest in any asset
that is not a Transferred Asset or Transferred Equity Interest. Specifically,
Sellers (and any of its Affiliates) right, title or interest in any
Excluded Asset is not being conveyed to Buyer.

 



-22- (c) _Assumed Liabilities_. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities and shall agree to satisfy and discharge when due the Assumed
Liabilities. After the Closing, Buyer shall pay all Assumed Liabilities as and
when such liabilities become due. Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller at
the Closing an assumption agreement in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ (the "
_Assumption Agreement_ ") and such other agreements and instruments as Seller
reasonably requests (the form and substance of which shall be mutually agreed
between the parties), whereby Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes to pay,
perform and discharge as and when due, the Assumed Liabilities. For the
avoidance of doubt, at the Closing, by means of the acquisition (directly or
indirectly) of the Transferred Equity Interests and not by means of a direct
assumption of such liabilities by Buyer, Buyer shall be responsible for the
liabilities of the Transferred Companies that would otherwise constitute
Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Annex 2.02(c)_  (as more specifically set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.07_).

(d) _Excluded Liabilities_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to pay,
perform or otherwise discharge, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, any Excluded Liability. Seller and its Affiliates will
remain liable to pay, perform and discharge when due, all Excluded
Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Closing, the acquisition
(directly or indirectly) of the Transferred Equity Interests shall not result
in the assumption by Buyer of the liabilities and obligations of the
Transferred Companies that would otherwise constitute Excluded Liabilities
pursuant to _Annex 2.02(d)_ (as more specifically set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.07_).

 

(e) _Country Transfer Agreements_. To the extent required by applicable Law or
as deemed necessary by either of the parties hereto, the transfer of each
Country Unit will be effected pursuant to a short-form agreement or one or
more instruments of transfer, such as a bill of sale, share transfer
agreement, business transfer agreement, real estate transfer agreement or
other asset assignment document, which agreement shall be prepared by Seller
and shall be on terms mutually agreed between the parties hereto and
consistent with and as close as reasonably possible to the applicable terms of
this Agreement (each, a " _Country Transfer Agreement_ "). The parties shall
enter into the Country Transfer Agreements as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof and not later than the Closing.

 

(f) _Designation of Affiliates_. To the extent that any of the Transferred
Assets or Transferred Equity Interests are under the control of any of
Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to promptly take such
legal action as may be necessary to consummate the transfer to Buyer and its
Affiliates of such Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests
under terms and conditions which are consistent with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement. Prior to, and in any event at least thirty (30) days in
advance of, the Closing, Buyer may designate, with the consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), one or more Affiliates
to, at the Closing, (i) acquire all or part of the Transferred Assets or
Transferred Equity Interests, (ii) assume all or part of the Assumed
Liabilities or (iii) pay a designated portion of the Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, in each case related to the applicable Country Unit,
as the case may be, in which event all references herein to Buyer will be
deemed to refer to such Affiliates, as appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such designation will in any event limit or affect the obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement to the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

 



-23- (g) _Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent_. With respect to each
Product, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that,
effective as of the Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter,
either (A) (1) the Product Registrations that constitute Transferred Assets
shall have transferred to, or shall have been approved in writing by the
applicable Governmental Entity for transfer to, Buyer or its designee or (2)
Buyer shall have obtained a Product Registration (including any re-
registrations) that enables Buyer or its designee to manufacture, distribute
and market such Product in each applicable jurisdiction, or (B) Buyer or its
designee otherwise shall have either (1) acceded to Sellers or its
Affiliates rights in respect of manufacturing, distributing and marketing
such Products under such Product Registrations, including by Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller designating Buyer or its designee as an authorized agent
with respect to such Products, or (2) been designated as a manufacturing,
sales or distribution agent with respect to the Products under such Product
Registrations, in the case of this clause (B), pursuant to reasonable, lawful
and customary arrangements to effectuate the foregoing (the time at which any
of the foregoing occurs with respect to a Product Registration (or, if
earlier, the expiration of such Product Registration in accordance with its
terms), the " _Product Registration Transfer Time_ "). If the Product
Registration Transfer Time shall not have occurred on the Closing Date with
respect to any such Product Registration, until such Product Registration
Transfer Time with respect to such Product Registration, (X) the parties
will continue to use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Product
Registration Transfer Time with respect to such Product occurs as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, (Y) Seller shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries to, consent to Buyers and its Affiliates use of such
Product Registration for the continued operation of the Business with respect
to such Product after the Closing, and (Z) if requested by Buyer, Seller
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide Buyer, to the fullest
extent possible, pursuant to an arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Seller
and Buyer, the exclusive net benefit of such Product Registration (including,
to the extent not able to be conducted by Buyer and its Affiliates after the
Closing as result of the failure of the Product Registration Transfer Time to
occur, by Seller and its subsidiaries continuing to conduct the Business with
respect to such Product in substantially the same manner and with
substantially the same level of efforts and resources as conducted by Seller
and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing) by passing through all revenues
received by Seller and its subsidiaries with respect to the Products under
such Product Registration from the Closing Date through such Product
Registration Transfer Time, less only such amount of costs and expenses
(including Taxes) as Seller and its Affiliates incur or become liable for in
connection with any such arrangements with respect to such Products (other
than any such costs and expenses that are duplicative of documented costs and
expenses actually incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in connection the
conduct of the Business with respect to such Products). The parties agree
they will cooperate to minimize the costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the foregoing arrangements, including by using commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid duplicative or incremental costs and expenses. Furthermore,
the parties agree that Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
utilize their respective ordinary course transfer pricing in connection with
the foregoing arrangements, including in connection with any sale of Products
from Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer or its Affiliates. In the case of the
occurrence of the Product Registration Transfer Time under clause (B) of the
definition thereof with respect to any Product Registration, (x) unless the
parties agree otherwise, the arrangements contemplated by such clause (B)
with respect to a Product shall

 



-24-  terminate reasonably promptly upon the occurrence of any of the events
contemplated by clause (A) of the definition of Product Registration Transfer
Time and (y) unless Buyer requests otherwise, the parties will continue to
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that one of the events contemplated by
clause (A) of the definition of Product Registration Transfer Time occurs with
respect to such Product Registration as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing. In addition to the foregoing, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) of any
Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals (including Anti-Trust
Approvals), consents or waivers and such authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery
thereof. From the date hereof until eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers and to give any notices required for the transfer of such
Transferred Asset and to obtain from third parties an approval or consent to
establish a new contract with Buyer or its designated Affiliate with respect
to the portion of any Commingled Contract related to the Business, pursuant to
which Buyer or its designated Affiliate will have access to the rights and
benefits of such Commingled Contract with respect to the Business on
substantially the same terms and conditions provided to Seller and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing, or to assign such portion to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be
required to pay any consideration (other than customary filing and application
fees typically paid by a seller or transferee) or make any concession
therefor. If such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained,
Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such Transferred
Asset or, if applicable, that portion of any Commingled Contract, as the case
may be, to Buyer or its designee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_ at no
additional cost. Pending the earlier of obtaining such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver or the expiration of such eighteen-month (18
month) period, insofar as reasonably practicable and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Seller shall hold such Transferred Assets for the benefit
of Buyer and shall operate such Transferred Assets in a manner to place Buyer
in a substantially similar position as if such Transferred Assets had been
sold, conveyed, assigned and transferred. Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Seller in connection with any actions taken by
Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(g)_. Buyer further agrees
that, if Seller shall have complied with its obligations under this Agreement
with respect to using reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, Seller shall not be in breach of this Agreement
solely as a result of the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval,
consent or waiver.

(h) _Buyer_ __ _s Recording and Similar Responsibilities_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, it shall be Buyers
responsibility (i) to prepare the applicable country patent assignments and
trademark assignments in respect of the Transferred IP and to record such
assignments following execution thereof by Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate), (ii) to apply for its own marketing authorizations for the
Products to the relevant regulatory authorities where it is not within the
power of Seller to cause, by giving notice to the applicable regulatory
authority or otherwise, the transfer directly to Buyer of the existing
marketing authorizations that are Transferred Assets and (iii) to bear the
fees and other costs in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06(d)_. Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide all reasonable assistance to
Buyer in connection with the foregoing at Buyers expense to the extent Seller
or its Affiliates incurs third-party costs related thereto.

 



-25- (i) _Certain European Interests_. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to
applicable Law, the relevant Employee Representatives of the entities set
forth on _Schedule 2.02(i)(A)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the " _French Entity_
") and _Schedule 2.02(i)(B)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the " _Dutch Entity_
") will have to be informed and consulted in advance of any final decisions
being taken by the French Entity and Dutch Entity (as applicable, the "
_Consultation Process_ ") with respect to the proposed purchase and sale of
any Transferred Assets located in France (such proposed Transferred Assets,
collectively, the " _French Assets_ "), and the Netherlands (such proposed
Transferred Assets, collectively, the " _Dutch Assets_ "), respectively.

(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
unless and until Seller has executed and delivered to Buyer the French
Acceptance Notice (which shall not occur until the end of the Consultation
Process in France, _i.e._ , until the applicable works council of the French
Entity has rendered a clear opinion in writing or until the French Entity
reasonably concludes that, as a matter of French Law, the applicable works
council of the French Entity is deemed to have been consulted and to have
rendered a negative opinion, in accordance with the provisions of
French Law), (a) the provisions of this _Article II_ shall not be effective
with respect to the French Assets, (b) for the purpose of this _Article II_
_,_ the French Assets shall not be considered Transferred Assets, and (c) the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the French Purchase Price. On the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer Letter attached as _Exhibit_ _F-1_ hereto
(the " _French Offer Letter_ "), including the price specified therein (the "
_French Purchase Price_ "), Buyer has irrevocably offered to acquire, or to
cause its applicable Affiliates to acquire, the French Assets and to have the
provisions of this  _Article II_ apply to such French Assets following the
acceptance by Seller of Buyers irrevocable offer as set out in the French
Offer Letter (as may be amended by express agreement between the parties in
the event that points arise during the Consultation Process, as set forth in
the French Offer Letter). It is understood that in entering into this
Agreement, Seller is not in any regard bound to accept Buyers irrevocable
offer as set out in the French Offer Letter. Upon delivery to Buyer of the
executed French Acceptance Notice attached as _Schedule_ _2_ to the French
Offer Letter (the " _French Acceptance Notice_ "), this _Article II_ shall be
effective with respect to the French Assets and the French Assets shall be
included in the Transferred Assets, as though, in each case, they had always
been so included, and the Purchase Price shall no longer be reduced by the
French Purchase Price. It is understood that the Purchase Price assumes
delivery of the French Acceptance Notice and therefore already includes the
French Purchase Price.

 

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
unless and until Seller has executed and delivered to Buyer the Dutch
Acceptance Notice (which shall not occur until the end of the Consultation
Process in the Netherlands, _i.e._ , until the applicable works council of the
Dutch Entity has rendered an opinion in writing or until the Dutch
Entity reasonably concludes that, as a matter of Dutch Law, the applicable
works council of the Dutch Entity has sufficiently been able to render an
opinion, in accordance with the provisions of Dutch Law), (a) the provisions
of this _Article II_  shall

 



-26-  not be effective with respect to the Dutch Assets, (b) for the purpose of
this _Article II,_ the Dutch Assets shall not be considered Transferred
Assets, and (c) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Dutch Purchase
Price. On the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Letter attached as
_Exhibit F-2_ hereto (the " _Dutch Offer Letter_ "), including the price
specified therein (the " _Dutch Purchase Price_ "), Buyer has irrevocably
offered to acquire, or to cause its applicable Affiliates to acquire, the
Dutch Assets and to have the provisions of this _Article II_ apply to such
Dutch Assets following the acceptance by Seller of Buyers irrevocable offer
as set out in the Dutch Offer Letter (as may be amended by express agreement
between the parties in the event that points arise during the
Consultation Process, as set forth in the Dutch Offer Letter). It is
understood that in entering into this Agreement, Seller is not in any regard
bound to accept Buyers irrevocable offer as set out in the Dutch Offer
Letter. Upon delivery to Buyer of the executed Dutch Acceptance Notice
attached as _Schedule 2_ to the Dutch Offer Letter (the " _Dutch Acceptance
Notice_ "), this _Article II_ shall be effective with respect to the Dutch
Assets and the Dutch Assets shall be included in the Transferred Assets, as
though, in each case, they had always been so included, and the Purchase Price
shall no longer be reduced by the Dutch Purchase Price. It is understood that
the Purchase Price assumes delivery of the Dutch Acceptance Notice and
therefore already includes the Dutch Purchase Price.

(j) _Italian Interests_. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to applicable
Law, the relevant Employee Representatives of the Selling Affiliate set forth
on _Schedule 2.02(j)(i)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the " _Italian Entity_ ")
will have to be informed and consulted in advance of any final decision being
taken by the Italian Entity with respect to the contribution by the Italian
Entity of the Transferred Assets owned by it, i.e. _conferimento_ _di_ _ramo_
  _d_ __ _azienda_ , into the entity set forth on _Schedule 2.02(j)(ii)_ to
the Disclosure Letter (the " _Italian Target_ "), in accordance with the union
consultation procedure before the applicable Italian Entity Employee
Representative pursuant to Section 47 of Italian Law n. 428/1990 (the "
_Italian Consultation Process_ "). The parties acknowledge that the proposed
purchase and sale of the Transferred Equity Interests of the Italian Target
is conditional upon the completion of the Italian Consultation Process (which
shall be deemed satisfied when Seller delivers written notice to Buyer that
such Italian Consultation Process has been completed in accordance with
applicable Italian Law). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Italian
Consultation Process is not completed by the Closing, then the purchase and
sale of the Transferred Equity Interests of the Italian Target shall be
treated in the manner that other Transferred Assets are treated in _Section
2.02(g)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all items taken into account in the
Purchase Price adjustment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall not
be adjusted to reflect the exclusion of the assets of the Italian Target at
the Closing but shall be reflected as if the transfer of the Italian Target
shall have occurred at the Closing.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause one or more of
its Affiliates as Buyer may designate pursuant to _Section 2.02(f)_ to) pay or
cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller may
designate), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more
bank accounts designated in writing by Seller at least two (2) business days
prior to the Closing Date, cash in U.S. dollars (subject to _Section
2.03(b)_) in an amount exclusive of any Transfer Taxes equal to the Purchase
Price. 

 



-27- (b) If requested by Seller, Buyer shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price
applicable to the Country Units identified on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ to the
Disclosure Letter in the applicable Foreign Currency set forth on such
Schedule. The conversion rate from U.S. dollars to the applicable Foreign
Currency shall be the closing rate provided by Bloomberg at 5:00 a.m. New
York City time three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if applicable Law in a Country Unit identified on _Schedule
2.03(b)_ to the Disclosure Letter requires that the applicable portion of the
Purchase Price be paid by a legal entity organized under the laws of such
Country Unit, and Buyer reasonably requires more than two (2) business days to
convert U.S. dollars into the applicable Foreign Currency and thereafter
transfer such funds to one of its Affiliates so organized, then Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to agree on an alternative conversion
mechanism that will allow Buyer to pay the applicable portion of the Purchase
Price on the Closing Date in accordance with applicable Law. _Schedule
2.03(b)_ to the Disclosure Letter sets forth Sellers good-faith estimate as
of the date of this Agreement of the portion of the Purchase Price to be
allocated to each Country Unit identified therein for payment in a Foreign
Currency.

(c) At least three (3) business days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement setting
forth Sellers good-faith estimate of the Cash Amount (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Cash Amount_ ").

 

(d) The " _Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to the sum of (i) six billion
fifty-nine million one hundred twenty-three thousand sixty-two dollars
($6,059,123,062) _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Cash Amount, with such Purchase
Price being increased or decreased as a result of (x) the inventory, and cash
adjustments, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, and (y) the
adjustment, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_, and shall be
allocated as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) For the purposes of
clarification only, Seller is retaining all accounts payable and current
liabilities (subject to clause (i)(2) of _Annex 2.02(d)_ ) and accounts
receivable and current assets (other than Inventory and any Cash Amount)
arising out of the operation and conduct of the Business before the Closing,
and the only purchase price adjustment after the Closing with respect to
changes in the working capital of the Business (but without prejudice to the
adjustment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_) will be the
adjustments of the Inventory and the Cash Amount pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.04_.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Price Adjustment Statement_ "), setting
forth the book value of the Inventory, prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Policies, transferred to Buyer as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Closing Inventory_ ") and the Cash Amount. If the book value
of the Closing Inventory is greater than the Inventory Target or less than the
Inventory Target by the amounts specified in _Section 2.04(f)_ below, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(f)_
below. If the Cash Amount is greater than the Estimated Cash Amount or less
than the Estimated Cash Amount, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
described in _Section 2.04(f)_ below.

(c) In connection with the preparation of the Price Adjustment Statement, (i)
Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to assist, Seller, its
accountants, advisors and other representatives in its preparation of the
Price Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to 

 



-28-  Seller, its accountants, advisors and other representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Business to the extent relevant to the preparation of the
Price Adjustment Statement (including taking and preparing physical counts of
Inventory) and (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, consult
with Buyer in good faith and provide Buyer, its accountants, advisors and
other representatives with any reasonably requested information, data or back-
up materials with respect to the calculation of the Closing Inventory and the
Cash Amount. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, the book value of
the Inventory will be determined in a manner consistent with the relevant
accounting policies and methodologies used in the preparation of the Financial
Information (including any applicable accounting reserves or adjustments)
(the " _Accounting Policies_ ").

(d) The Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer
unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. The Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement
so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then
the Price Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x)
or (y) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier
of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve any differences they have with
respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date
any matters in dispute are resolved by an accounting firm (in accordance with
the procedure set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_) selected by Seller and
Buyer or, if the parties are unable to agree, an independent accounting firm
selected by Sellers and Buyers independent accounting firms (such firm, the
" _Accounting Firm_ ").

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ shall not apply to any dispute
described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_. During the thirty-(30) day period
immediately following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences they may
have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At
the end of such thirty- (30) day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for
review and resolution by the Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain
in dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the
Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of the values set forth on
the Price Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare
the final Price Adjustment Statement), which determination shall be binding on
the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , the scope of such determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to: (i) those matters that remain in dispute
and that were included in the Notice of Disagreement; (ii) whether the
calculations of the Inventory and the Cash Amount were prepared in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, specifically, in the case of the calculation
of Inventory, whether the Accounting Policies were used; and (iii) whether
there were mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment Statement, and the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any other
determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to
the accuracy of _Section_ __ _ 3.06_ or any other representation or warranty
in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates with any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_). The Price Adjustment Statement shall become
final and binding on Buyer and Seller on the date the Accounting Firm delivers
the final Price Adjustment Statement to the parties. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall be borne
one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

 



-29- (f) If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of the
Closing Inventory is one hundred five percent (105%) or more of the Inventory
Target, then the amount by which the book value of the Closing Inventory
exceeds the Inventory Target shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to
the Purchase Price. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book
value of the Closing Inventory is ninety-five percent (95%) or less of the
Inventory Target, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount by which the book value of the Closing Inventory
is less than the Inventory Target. If the Price Adjustment Statement
discloses that the book value of the Closing Inventory is greater than ninety-
five percent (95%), but less than one hundred five percent (105%), of the
Inventory Target, then there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price in
respect of the Closing Inventory. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses
that the Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, then the amount of
such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price.
If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Cash Amount is less than
the Estimated Cash Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit.

 

(g) No payment pursuant to _Section 2.04(f)_ need be made by either party

the negative Purchase Price adjustment under _Section 2.04(f)_.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer
shall deliver a reasonable draft of the allocation of the Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities among the Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity
Interests (and among the assets held by any Transferred Company disregarded as
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) in a manner
that incorporates, reflects and is consistent with _Exhibit M_ attached
hereto (the " _Allocation Method_ ") on a country-by-country basis (the "
_Initial Allocation_ ") to Seller (the " _Proposed Initial Allocation_ ").
Except as provided in this subparagraph (a) and subparagraph (c) of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_, at the close of business on the thirtieth (30th)
calendar day after delivery of the Proposed Initial Allocation, the Proposed
Initial Allocation shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller, shall be set
forth on _Schedule 2.05(a)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the " _Initial
Allocation Schedule_ "), and shall be the Initial Allocation. Seller shall
raise any objection (so long as such

 



-30-  objection is reasonable) to the Proposed Initial Allocation in writing
within thirty (30) calendar days of the delivery of the Proposed Initial
Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of Sellers
objection. If Buyer and Seller reach written agreement amending the Proposed
Initial Allocation within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Proposed
Initial Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller,
shall be set forth in the Initial Allocation Schedule, and shall be the
Initial Allocation.

 

(b) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver a reasonable draft of the allocation of the Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities among each of the Transferred Assets and Transferred
Equity Interests (and among the assets held by any Transferred Company
disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S. federal income Tax purposes)
in a manner that incorporates, reflects and is consistent with the Allocation
Method, the Initial Allocation, and Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code (the "
_Allocation_ ") to Seller (the " _Proposed Allocation_ "). Except as provided
in this subparagraph (b) and subparagraph (c) of this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_,
at the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after delivery
of the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon
Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth on _Schedule 2.05(b)_ to the Disclosure
Letter (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), and shall be the Allocation.

 

(c) Seller shall raise any objection (so long as such objection is reasonable)
to the Proposed Allocation in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of the
delivery of the Proposed Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any differences within thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery of Sellers objection. If Buyer and Seller reach written agreement
amending the Proposed Allocation within such thirty (30) calendar day period,
the Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be
the Allocation.

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ shall not apply to any
dispute described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. If Buyer and Seller cannot
agree on the Initial Allocation or the Allocation within thirty (30) calendar
days after delivery of Sellers objection, then all remaining disputed items
shall be submitted for resolution by an independent appraisal firm mutually
selected by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall each request that the
independent appraisal firm make a final determination as to the disputed
items, in a manner that is consistent with the Allocation Method, within
thirty (30) calendar days after such submission. The Proposed Initial
Allocation or the Proposed Allocation, as applicable, shall be amended in
accordance with the findings of such independent appraisal firm, and the
Proposed Initial Allocation or the Proposed Allocation, as applicable and as
so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth
in the Initial Allocation Schedule or the Allocation Schedule, and shall be
the Initial Allocation or the Allocation, as applicable. The fees, costs and
expenses of the independent appraisal firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller.

 

(e) The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments (including
those described in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_) to the Purchase Price under this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation Method. If, after all
adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with respect to the
Closing Inventory of any Selling Affiliate, when expressed in the relevant

 



-31-  local currency at the Exchange Rate used to determine the Closing Inventory,
is different from the local currency net book value recorded on the statutory
books for the Closing Inventory of such Selling Affiliate as of the Closing
Date, then the Allocation with respect to the Closing Inventory of such
Selling Affiliate shall be adjusted so that it is equal to such local currency
net book value, and the parties will agree to a corresponding upward or
downward adjustment (as appropriate) elsewhere in the Allocation, in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Method.

(f) Each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and
file its Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) on a basis
consistent with the Allocation and, except as otherwise required by Law (as
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller (and each party shall reasonably
endeavor to reach such mutual agreement)), shall take no position inconsistent
with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing
Authority or otherwise. If Seller and Buyer are unable to mutually agree that
an item or action is required by applicable Law, such disagreement shall be
referred to the Accounting Firm promptly for review and resolution (in
accordance with the procedure set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_). In the
event that the Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto,
and both Seller and Buyer agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to defend such Allocation in any audit or similar proceeding.

(g) In the event that the Allocation has not become final pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_ by the Closing:

(i) The allocated purchase prices included in the Proposed Allocation shall
be used for the purpose of (A) including allocated purchase prices in the
Country Transfer Agreements for each applicable Country Unit and (B)
determining the amount of any payments made on the Closing Date to the
applicable Selling Affiliate with respect to such Country Unit. The inclusion
of such allocated purchase prices shall not be deemed to waive, amend or
otherwise alter any of the rights or obligations of the parties set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and shall not be used for any purpose in
resolving, or result in any prejudice with respect to, any dispute with
respect to the Proposed Allocation or the Allocation.

 

(ii) To the extent that the amounts paid to any Selling Affiliate on the
Closing Date are not equal to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
such Selling Affiliate in the Allocation (with respect to any Selling
Affiliate, the " _Allocated Purchase Price_ "), the parties shall and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to take all necessary actions to refund,
repay and redistribute as promptly as reasonably practicable any amounts paid
to any Selling Affiliate in excess of such Selling Affiliates Allocated
Purchase Price, such that, after giving effect to any such
refunds, repayments and redistributions, the amounts received by each Selling
Affiliate shall be equal to such Selling Affiliates Allocated Purchase Price.

 

SECTION 2.06. _Transfer Taxes; VAT_.

 

(a) All Transfer Taxes arising from, or relating to, the Internal
Restructuring Steps shall be borne and paid by Seller when due in
compliance with applicable Transfer Tax Laws;

 



-32-   _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer is required by applicable Law to pay
any such Transfer Taxes, then Buyer shall pay such Transfer Taxes, and Seller
shall, subject to receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of Buyers
payment thereof, promptly reimburse Buyer for such Transfer Taxes, whether or
not such Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

 

(b) All other Transfer Taxes imposed on the transfer of the Transferred Equity
Interests and the Transferred Assets to Buyer and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities by Buyer shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer when due in
compliance with applicable Transfer Tax Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Seller is required by applicable Law to pay any such Transfer Taxes,
then Seller shall pay such Transfer Taxes, and Buyer shall, subject to
receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment thereof,
promptly reimburse Seller for such Transfer Taxes, whether or not such
Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

(c) The party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax
Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other party.
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings
relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) The amount of any payment for a supply of goods or for services or the
value of any supply made or deemed to be made by Seller, any Affiliate of
Seller or a Transferred Company pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any
other agreement that is intended to effect the transfer of assets or
Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement (including any assignment and bill of
sale, assumption agreement, real estate deed, or other instrument of
conveyance) shall be exclusive of any VAT properly chargeable on the supply,
and, upon receipt of a valid invoice (or other valid and customary
documentation, if any) in compliance with applicable Law and reasonably
detailing the applicable VAT, the amount of such VAT shall be paid by Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer or the recipient of such supply (in addition to any
consideration for that supply), subject to the provisions of the relevant
Country Transfer Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any Country Transfer Agreement, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall be responsible for any such VAT). To the extent applicable,
each Country Transfer Agreement shall make provision for matters relating to
the VAT treatment of the business or assets transferred under that Country
Transfer Agreement and cooperation in respect thereto including, without
limitation, in connection with (i) the treatment of the transfer of the
relevant business or assets as (x) a transfer of a going concern, including
the transfer of a totality of assets or parts thereof, within the meaning of
applicable VAT Laws, directives and regulations or (y) neither a supply of
goods nor services for the purposes of applicable VAT Law, and (ii) the
provision and maintenance of, and access to, relevant VAT records. The Parties
shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts in order to minimize any VAT
burden and liquidity burden on the purchase and transfer of relevant business
or assets pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) if and to the extent there is a
reasonable basis for the position that the transfer qualifies as a VAT-free
transfer ( _i.e._ , a transfer outside the scope of VAT, not subject to VAT,
exempt from VAT or otherwise relieved from VAT) of a business or assets under
applicable VAT Law, treat the purchase and transfer of relevant business or
assets as such VAT-free transfer and in particular (i) prepare and file their
Tax Returns, and (ii) issue their invoices, in compliance with
such treatment.

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(d)_, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer
and its Affiliates harmless against any VAT Liabilities resulting from input
VAT corrections pursuant to sec. 15a of the German VAT Act (
_Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) or similar provisions in other jurisdictions to the
extent they relate to input VAT claimed by Seller or any of its Affiliates
prior to or on the Closing Date, but only if the detrimental act giving rise
to such VAT Liability resulting from input VAT corrections pursuant to sec.
15a of the German VAT Act occurred prior to or on the Closing Date.

herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be permitted and entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Within fifteen (15) days of the expected Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver a schedule of expected withholding amounts to Seller. Furthermore,
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other to reduce the
amount of withholding Taxes imposed on the payment of any amount to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement and any other Transaction Document to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, including by reasonably cooperating in
order to execute and file any forms or certificates reasonably required to
claim an available reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding Taxes.

Subject to the foregoing and except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter,
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Good Standing_. (a) Each of Seller, the

Letter and the Dutch Offer Letter) to which it is or will be a party. This
Agreement, the French Offer Letter and the Dutch Offer Letter have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and have been duly

the Selling Affiliates to perform their obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the Transactions.

 

SECTION 3.08. _Compliance with Laws; Licenses and Permits_. (a) Sellers and

representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and without
undue interruption of the Business throughout the period prior to the Closing,
to all of the properties, books and records (other than records relating
to Income Taxes and attorney-client privileged communications and, for the
avoidance of doubt, other than where access to such information is prohibited
by applicable Law) relating to the Business, and will furnish, at Buyers
expense, Buyer, its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives
during such period all such information (other than records relating to Income
Taxes and attorney-client privileged communications and, for the avoidance of
doubt, other than where access to such information is prohibited by
applicable Law) concerning the affairs of the Business as Buyer may reasonably
request; _provided_ that this _Section 6.05(e)_ shall not entitle Buyer or its
accountants, legal counsel or other representatives to contact any third
party doing business with Seller or access the properties, books or records of
any such third party, in each case without Sellers prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Buyer will hold
in confidence all information so obtained in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.12_. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of the parties rights of
discovery.

 

(f) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall timely prepare,
and promptly deliver to Buyer, with respect to the Business, a statement of
sales, on a monthly basis, to be consistent with such financial information
previously provided to Buyer by Seller.

 

(g) Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Affiliates and the Transferred
Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Buyer
prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the date hereof or as promptly as
practicable thereafter each Material Distribution Contract.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Financing_. (a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other advisors and representatives to,
provide commercially reasonable cooperation in connection with
the arrangement by Buyer of bank financing and/or bond offerings for the
purpose of financing the Transactions, the fees and expenses incurred in
connection therewith and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; _provided_ that,
without limiting _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, (i) such requested cooperation shall
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller and its
Affiliates, (ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide
any audited or unaudited "carve-out" financial statements of the Business and
(iii) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide any updates
to the Financial Information. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all

 



-60-  out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with such cooperation. Buyer and its Affiliates shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and against any Damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith. Seller shall have the right to consent to the use of its and its
Affiliates logos in connection with the Debt Financing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are
not contingent on any debt or equity financing (including the Debt Financing)
or the receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

 

(c) None of the Debt Financing Sources, in their capacities as such, will have
any liability to Seller, any former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of Seller (in each
case in their capacities as such), or any former, current or future direct
or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing (in each case in their capacities as such)
(each, a " _Related Party_ "), relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither Seller nor any of its Related Parties will have any
rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources, in their
capacities as such, hereunder or thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ shall limit any obligations of the
Debt Financing Sources to Buyer or its Affiliates. 

SECTION 6.07. _Transferred Companies Assets and Liabilities_. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall take or cause to be taken, such action as is necessary
or appropriate to transfer, assign or convey (i) any assets owned or held by
the Transferred Companies other than those that would constitute Transferred
Assets or (ii) any liabilities or obligations of the Transferred Companies
other than those that would constitute Assumed Liabilities, in each case, to
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller such that as of the Closing, (x) the assets
owned or held by the Transferred Companies consist solely of assets that
would otherwise constitute Transferred Assets pursuant to clauses (i)(xvi)
and (xviii) of _Annex 2.02(a)_ and (y) the liabilities and obligations of the
Transferred Companies consist solely of liabilities and obligations that
would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities pursuant to clauses (i)(x) of
_Annex 2.02(c)_. Prior to or following the Closing, Buyer shall provide to
Seller the necessary information and deliver such assignments,
transfers, consents and other documents and instruments as may be reasonably
required to permit Seller at its expense to effect and perfect the transfer of
any registrations of Patents and Trademarks that constitute Excluded Assets
but which are held by a Transferred Company. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer, assign or convey any Pre-Closing
Accounts Receivable that are owned or held by the Transferred Companies and
any Pre-Closing Accounts Payable that are liabilities or obligations of the
Transferred Companies, in each case, to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
prior to the Closing, and if Seller shall have complied with such obligation
to use commercially reasonable efforts, Seller shall not be in breach of this
Agreement solely as a result of the failure of any such transfer, assignment
or conveyance to have been completed by Closing (it being understood that
following the Closing any Pre-Closing Accounts

 



-61-  Receivable (including any cash received in respect thereof) shall in any
event be treated as Excluded Assets and any Pre-Closing Accounts Payable shall
in any event be treated as Excluded Liabilities).

SECTION 6.08. _Exclusivity_. (a) From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates,
the Transferred Companies and its and their respective directors, officers or
employees, or any attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
any of them (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or take any other action designed or
reasonably likely to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
or assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect
to, any Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into or approve any agreement
with respect to any Alternative Proposal. None of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any of the Transferred Companies shall release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement with respect
to the Business to which it is a party and which was entered into with respect
to any potential Alternative Proposal. Seller and its Affiliates shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, with respect to third
parties with whom discussions or negotiations with respect to an Alternative
Proposal have been terminated on or prior to the date of this Agreement, use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or destruction of,
in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement,
confidential information previously furnished by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or its or their Representatives, with respect to the Business.

 

(b) Seller will promptly notify Buyer orally (and then in writing within
twenty-four (24) hours) after it or any of its Affiliates has received any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, any request for
discussions or negotiations, or any request for information relating to
the Business in connection with an Alternative Proposal or a potential
Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records
thereof of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is or becomes aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing. Such notice to Buyer shall indicate the identity
of the Person making such proposal and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any. Seller shall also promptly provide Buyer with (i) a copy of
any written notice or other written communication from any Person informing
Seller or any of its Affiliates that it is considering making, or has made a
proposal regarding, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Alternative
Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Seller or any of its
Affiliates and (iii) such other details of any such Alternative Proposal that
Buyer may reasonably request. Thereafter, Seller shall promptly keep Buyer
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to
the terms of any such Alternative Proposal.

(c) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any
expression of interest by any third party relating to Sellers or any of its
Affiliates willingness or ability to receive or discuss a proposal or offer,
other than a proposal or offer by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for
any merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, acquisition or other business combination, in each
case relating to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the
Business.

 



-62- SECTION 6.09. _Closing Structure_.

 

(a) Anything in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, Seller and its Affiliates may, prior to the Closing, take
actions to implement the Closing Structure (such actions, the " _Internal
Restructuring Steps_ "), it being understood that that such actions shall not
affect the parties rights and obligations with respect to the Transferred
Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities or the
parties indemnification and payment obligations hereunder. Seller has
delivered to Buyer a statement on _Schedule 6.09(a)_ to the Disclosure Letter
setting forth the expected Internal Restructuring Steps as of the date hereof.
Buyer shall have the right to review such statement setting forth the Internal
Restructuring Steps (and any statement setting forth any modification to such
Internal Restructuring Steps delivered pursuant to _Section 6.09(c)_ ) and any
additional information relating thereto that Buyer may reasonably request
prior to the implementation of the applicable Internal Restructuring Steps.
Buyer shall be entitled to submit written requests for modifications to such
Internal Restructuring Steps to Seller no more than fifteen (15) days after
the date hereof (or five (5) days after the date of delivery pursuant to
_Section 6.09(c)_ of any such statement setting forth any such modification to
such Internal Restructuring Steps) to the extent such requests address the
matters that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect Buyer or any
of its Affiliates after the Closing (taking into account Sellers
indemnification and payment obligations hereunder). Seller shall not
unreasonably withhold consent to such requests; _provided_ that, subject to
Sellers compliance with  _Section 6.10(b)_ and the last sentence of _Section
6.09(c)_ , with respect to requests for modifications to the Internal
Restructuring Steps relating to (x) the Swiss Asset Transfer (as defined
below) or (y) the transfer of Transferred Assets (1) by Selling Affiliates
that are organized in the United States or (2) indirectly through the transfer
of Transferred Companies that are organized in the United States (such
Transferred Assets, the " _U.S. Assets_ ," such transfer of U.S. Assets, the
" _U.S. Business Transfer_ " and such Internal Restructuring steps relating to
the Swiss Asset Transfer or the U.S. Business Transfer, the " _Specified
Internal Restructuring Steps_ "), Seller shall not modify such Internal
Restructuring Steps without Buyers consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such modification would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect Buyer or its Affiliates (taking into
account Sellers indemnification and payment obligations hereunder). Without
limitation of the foregoing rights of Buyer, prior to their implementation,
Buyer shall also have the right to review, and to submit written requests for
modifications to Seller with respect to, any new organizational documents
proposed to be adopted for the Transferred Companies, or amendments to be made
to existing organizational documents of the Transferred Companies, any
merger, demerger or similar filings (and amendments thereto) to be made by or
with respect to any Transferred Companies with Governmental Entities, any
agreements to which any Transferred Company will be a party (and
amendments thereto) and any other documents (if any) Buyer may reasonably
request, in each case that will implement the Internal Restructuring Steps if
any such amendment, filing, document or agreement would be reasonably expected
to adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing (taking
into account Sellers indemnification and payment obligations hereunder).
Seller shall not unreasonably withhold consent to such requests.

 



-63- (b) In the event Seller applies for or requests any Tax ruling with respect to
the Internal Restructuring Steps or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (to the extent any such Tax ruling would be reasonably expected
to adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing), (i)
Seller shall in good faith allow Buyer to make comments to Seller regarding
the Tax ruling and any materials submitted to any Taxing Authority, and (ii)
Buyer shall, at its own expense, have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the application or request for any Tax ruling ( _provided_
that this clause (ii) shall not apply with respect to any Swiss Tax Ruling).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the right of Buyer to comment
and participate pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not materially delay
or otherwise materially impede Sellers submission of materials to any Taxing
Authority or Sellers receipt of any such Tax ruling.

 

(c) Seller shall be entitled to modify the Closing Structure from time to time
with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
subject to Sellers compliance with _Section 6.10(b)_ and the last sentence
of this _Section 6.09(c)_, Seller shall be entitled to modify the Closing
Structure with respect to the U.S. Business Transfer and/or the Swiss Asset
Transfer from time to time without Buyers prior consent unless such
modification would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
Buyer or its Affiliates (taking into account Sellers indemnification and
payment obligations hereunder). If any modification described in the previous
sentence would reasonably be expected to result in a delay of the Product
Registration Transfer Time with respect to any Product, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to address any adverse consequences to Buyer
as a result of such delay. In the event the Closing Structure is so modified,
_Schedule 1.01(f)_ shall be deemed to be automatically amended to reflect
such modifications to the extent applicable. Seller shall be entitled to
modify the Internal Restructuring Steps from time to time, _provided_ that, to
the extent any proposed modification to the Internal Restructuring Steps
would be reasonably expected to adversely affect Buyer or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing (taking into account Sellers indemnification and
payment obligations hereunder), Sellers right to modify such steps shall be
subject to the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _further_ _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to Sellers compliance with _Section 6.10(b)_
and the last sentence of this _Section 6.09(c)_ , Seller shall be entitled to
modify the Specified Internal Restructuring Steps from time to time without
Buyers prior consent unless such modification would be reasonably expected to
materially adversely affect Buyer or its Affiliates (taking into account
Sellers indemnification and payment obligations hereunder). To the extent
Seller finally determines to make any such modification pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Seller shall deliver a statement setting forth such
modified Internal Restructuring Steps to Buyer as promptly as practicable
following any such final decision to modify. In the event the Internal
Restructuring Steps are so modified, _Schedule 6.09(a)_ to the Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to be automatically amended to reflect such
modifications to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the transfer of the Transferred Assets owned,
as of the date hereof, by the Specified Entity shall be structured as a sale
of the Transferred Assets by the Specified Entity or one of its Swiss
Affiliates to Buyer or one of its non-Swiss Affiliates (such Transfer, the "
_Swiss Asset Transfer_ "), (ii) Seller shall, pursuant to the Internal
Restructuring Steps, cause Innerdyne Holdings, Inc., and KPR U.S., Inc. to
transfer cash equal to the amount of outstanding intercompany indebtedness
owed to Covidien Finance International, GmbH in satisfaction of such
indebtedness, and (iii) Seller shall, pursuant to the

 



-64-  Internal Restructuring Steps, cause KPR U.S., LLC to be treated as either
(A) an entity disregarded as separate from its owner or (B) an association
taxable as a corporation, in each case, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
effective at or prior to the Closing.

SECTION 6.10. _Basis Calculations_.

 

(a) As of the date hereof, the parties hereto agree that the U.S. Assets that
are Inventory (the " _U.S. Inventory_ ") have an estimated Tax basis equal to
the Estimated Inventory Tax Basis and all the U.S. Assets have an estimated
aggregate Tax basis equal to the Estimated Aggregate Tax Basis. Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, deliver to Buyer any documentation or
information that is reasonably requested by Buyer in order to determine the
aggregate Tax basis of the U.S. Inventory as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Final Inventory Tax Basis_ ") and the aggregate Tax basis of
all U.S. Assets as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Aggregate
Tax Basis_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the U.S. federal
income Tax Return of Covidien LP for the taxable year in which Covidien LP
completes the transfer of the U.S. Assets pursuant to the Internal
Restructuring Steps, the parties shall mutually agree on a final determination
of the Final Inventory Tax Basis and the Final Aggregate Tax Basis (and each
party shall reasonably endeavor to reach such mutual agreement). If Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to the Final
Inventory Tax Basis or the Final Aggregate Tax Basis, such disagreement shall
be referred to the Accounting Firm promptly for review and resolution (in
accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_). Within
ninety (90) days after the date on which Covidien LP completes the transfer of
the U.S. Assets pursuant to the Internal Restructuring Steps, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer revised estimates of the Tax basis of the U.S. Inventory and
the U.S. Assets.

 

(b) Seller shall pay over to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Buyer, cash in
U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the
amount by which the Estimated Aggregate Tax Basis exceeds the Final Aggregate
Tax Basis, multiplied by (y) the Buyer Tax Rate or (ii) the product of (x)
the amount by which the Estimated Inventory Tax Basis exceeds the Final
Inventory Tax Basis, multiplied by (y) the Buyer Tax Rate.

 

(c) To the extent that, (i) Seller or its Affiliates cause KPR U.S., LLC to
assume any liabilities (including by contributing, or causing a contribution
of, any assets to KPR U.S., LLC subject to any liabilities) and (ii) KPR U.S.,
LLC holds such liabilities as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the excess of the amount such liabilities
held by KPR U.S., LLC as of the Closing over $0.

SECTION 6.11. _Certain Swiss Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_, Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to minimize the Swiss Tax Rate. To the extent Seller receives, prior
to the Closing, a Swiss Tax Ruling, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Swiss Sale Amount, less the sum of (i) the Estimated Swiss
Gain and (ii) (x) the Estimated Swiss Gain multiplied by the Swiss Tax Rate,
further multiplied by (y) the Swiss Gross-Up.

 



-65- (b) The Parties agree that if the Swiss Taxing Authorities deny or otherwise
reject a request by Seller or its Affiliates for a Swiss Tax Ruling, neither
Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any further obligation to seek a Swiss
Tax Ruling. If, after the Closing but prior to the filing of its Swiss income
Tax Return reflecting the gain from the Swiss Asset Transfer, Seller receives
a Swiss Tax Ruling, Seller shall pay over to Buyer, the amount calculated in
the last sentence of clause (a) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (x)
such Swiss Tax Ruling has not been issued or received within seventy-five
(75) days following the Closing, and (y) Seller determines that continued
efforts to seek a Swiss Tax Ruling would be reasonably expected to have an
adverse impact on Seller or its Affiliates, then Seller shall, in its
reasonable discretion, be entitled to not seek such Swiss Tax Ruling
(including, without limitation, by terminating or otherwise amending any
pending request for such Swiss Tax Ruling).

 

(c) Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonably detailed calculation of the
amount of gain recognized on the Swiss Asset Transfer. If at the time Seller
files its Swiss income Tax Return reflecting the gain from the Swiss Asset
Transfer, such gain is determined to be greater than the Estimated Swiss Gain,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to (i) the excess of such gain
over the Estimated Swiss Gain, multiplied by (ii) the Swiss Tax Rate, further
multiplied by (iii) the Swiss Gross-Up. If the gain on the Swiss Asset
Transfer is determined to be less than the Estimated Swiss Gain, Seller shall
pay to Buyer an amount equal to (i) the excess of the Estimated Swiss Gain
over such gain, multiplied by (ii) the Swiss Tax Rate, further multiplied by
(iii) the Swiss Gross-Up. Any calculation of gain pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.11(c)_ shall be determined without reduction for and without reference
to any Tax attributes of Seller or its Affiliates, other than the Swiss Tax
Basis.

(d) Payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by the recipient of such payment.

SECTION 6.12.  _Certain Financial Statements_. Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver (at Sellers sole cost and expense) to Buyer (a) by
May 15, 2017 audited financial statements of the Business for the fiscal year
ended April 29, 2016 and (b) by July 1, 2017 reviewed but unaudited financial
statements of the Business for the nine (9) fiscal months ended January 27,
2017; _provided_ , that in the event that either of the financial statements
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are not delivered to Buyer by
the dates specified in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), then, in each case,
Seller will remain obligated to continue to use reasonable best efforts to
deliver the financial statements to Buyer specified in the foregoing clauses
(a) and (b).

During the period commencing after the Closing:

 

SECTION 7.01. _Certain IP Matters_. (a) Buyer covenants that, except as
hereinafter set forth in the Trademark License Agreement 1, neither Buyer nor

held by a Transferred Company and (ii) Seller will reasonably cooperate with
Buyer, and Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Seller, as applicable, in

SECTION 7.03. _Access_. Subject to customary confidentiality undertakings
comparable to those included in the Confidentiality Agreements, (a) to the
extent reasonably required for tax, accounting, regulatory, compliance,
litigation or investigation purposes, or otherwise reasonably requested by
Seller (other than in connection with a dispute, claim or litigation between
Buyer and Seller or any of their respective Affiliates), Buyer will, during
normal business hours (upon twenty-four (24) hours written notice from
Seller), (i) make available its relevant personnel as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the foregoing and (ii) permit Seller
and its duly authorized representatives access to all contracts, books,
records (including employment records and personnel files of Transferred
Employees) and other data relating to the Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities conveyed and assumed at the

 



-67-  Closing to the extent that such materials were delivered to Buyer, in each
case except where such access is prohibited by applicable Law and (b) to the
extent reasonably required for tax, accounting, regulatory, compliance,
litigation or investigation purposes, or otherwise reasonably requested by
Buyer (other than in connection with a dispute, claim or litigation between
Buyer and Seller or any of their respective Affiliates), Seller will, during
normal business hours (upon twenty-four (24) hours written notice from

authorized representatives access to all contracts, books, records and other
data relating to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities retained at the
Closing to the extent that such materials were retained by Seller and relate
to the Business, except where such access is prohibited by applicable Law.
Seller agrees that after the Closing, Buyer or its authorized representatives
may, at Buyers cost and expense, have access to and make copies of any books
and records (including emails) (in each case, or redacted portions thereof)
that have not been transferred to Buyer to the extent they relate to the
Business, except where providing copies is prohibited by applicable Law.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner in
connection with the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_.

 

SECTION 7.04. _Insurance_.

 

(a) Except (1) with respect to insurance proceeds that constitute Transferred
Assets pursuant to clause (xiv) of _Annex 2.02(a)_ , or (2) as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.04(c)_, the coverage under all
insurance policies related to the Business and arranged or maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates is only for the benefit of Seller and its
Affiliates, and not for the benefit of Buyer or the Business. Except as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.04(c)_, as of the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies
(including self-insurance or similar arrangements funded directly or
indirectly by Buyer or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the Business
covering all periods following the Closing and, without prejudice to any
right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of
Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies which may provide coverage for
claims relating in any way to the Business.

(b) Solely to the extent required for Buyer and its Affiliates to comply with
applicable Law that requires Buyer and its Affiliates to maintain workers
compensation insurance coverage for Transferred Employees for the period prior
to the Closing, with respect to claims relating to acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to Transferred Employees that occurred or existed
prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing WC Claims_") that are covered by Sellers
or its Affiliates workers compensation insurance policies relating to
Transferred Employees (" _Workers Compensation Policies_ "), Seller hereby
authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by such Workers Compensation
Policies, to report Pre-Closing WC Claims directly to the provider of such
Workers Compensation Policies and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(at Buyers expense), to the extent permitted by such Workers Compensation
Policies, to assist Buyers efforts to obtain the benefit of such insurance
coverage with respect to such Pre-Closing WC Claims; _provided_ that Buyer
shall keep Seller reasonably informed of each claim and Buyer shall
exclusively bear and shall promptly either directly pay (in lieu of Seller or
its Affiliates having to first pay) or repay or reimburse Seller or its
Affiliates for the amount of each claim and related costs or expenses
(including increased premiums) and for the amount of any deductibles or self-
insured retentions (including captive insurance amounts) associated with any
such claims

 



-68-  under the Workers Compensation Policies and Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be liable for any and all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible
amounts of such payments; and  _provided_ _further_ that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts (including prior to the
Closing) to obtain, as soon as reasonably practicable, replacement insurance
policies (including self-insurance) such that Buyer and its Affiliates are no
longer legally required to have access to the Workers Compensation Policies.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or
its Affiliates to extend or purchase any insurance policy. 

(c) Solely to the extent required for Buyer and its Affiliates to comply with
applicable Law that requires Buyer and its Affiliates to maintain automobile
liability insurance coverage for the Business or the Transferred Employees for
the period prior to the Closing, with respect to claims relating to events or
incidents relating to the Business or the Transferred Employees that occurred
prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Auto Claims_") that are covered by
Sellers or its Affiliates automobile liability insurance policies relating
to the Business or the Transferred Employees (" _Auto Policies_ "), Seller
hereby authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by such Auto Policies, to
report Pre-Closing Auto Claims directly to the provider of such Auto Policies
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at Buyers expense), to the
extent permitted by such Auto Policies, to assist Buyers efforts to obtain
the benefit of such insurance coverage with respect to such Pre-Closing Auto
Claims; _provided_ that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of each
claim and Buyer shall exclusively bear and shall promptly either directly pay
(in lieu of Seller or its Affiliates having to first pay) or repay or
reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for the amount of each claim and related
costs or expenses (including increased premiums) and for the amount of any
deductibles or self-insured retentions (including captive insurance amounts)
associated with any such claims under the Auto Policies and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be liable for any and all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable
or uncollectible amounts of such payments; and _provided_ _further_  that
Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts (including
prior to the Closing) to obtain, as soon as reasonably practicable,
replacement insurance policies (including self-insurance) such that Buyer and
its Affiliates are no longer legally required to have access to the Auto
Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Seller or its Affiliates to extend or purchase any insurance policy.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Payments from Third Parties_. In the event that, on or after
the Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other funds due
to the other pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction Documents, then
the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the proper
party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right of offset
regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received from third
parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a dispute
regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents.

 

SECTION 7.06. _Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, if either Buyer
or Seller becomes aware that any of the Transferred Assets has not been
transferred to Buyer or that any of the Excluded Assets has been transferred
to Buyer, it shall promptly notify the other and the parties hereto shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable and, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(g)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_, ensure that such property is transferred, with any
necessary prior third-party consent or approval, to:

 

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset which was not transferred at
the Closing; or

 

(b) Seller, in the case of any Excluded Asset which was transferred at the
Closing.

 



-69- SECTION 7.07. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, each party will execute and
deliver, or cause its Affiliates to execute and deliver, all such documents
and instruments and will take, or cause its Affiliates to take, all such
further actions, in each case as may be reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 7.08. _Tax Matters_. 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

(i) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies
or in respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business, in each case, that
are due (including applicable extensions) before the Closing. Seller shall
prepare all income Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing
(" _Pre-Closing Entity Tax Returns_"). Seller shall prepare all Tax Returns
(other than Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies) in respect of the
Transferred Assets or the Business for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing (" _Pre-Closing
Business Tax Returns_" and, together with Pre-Closing Entity Tax Returns, "
_Pre-Closing Tax Returns_"). Seller shall also prepare and file all Tax
Returns for Transferred Companies that are required to be included in (or
filed with) a Tax Return of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
aggregate group of which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a
Transferred Company) is parent for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. With respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Return required to be prepared by Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)(i)_, (1) such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Transferred
Companies or with respect to the Transferred Assets or the Business,
respectively, unless a different position is required by Law and the parties
mutually agree on the resolution of such issue (and each party shall
reasonably endeavor to reach such mutual agreement), (2) Seller shall deliver
to Buyer for its review and comment, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Return in the case of a
separate income Tax Return of the Transferred Companies, and at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Return in
the case of a separate non-income Tax Return of the Transferred Companies or
in respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business (in each case taking
into account any applicable extensions), a copy of such Tax Return, together
with any additional information that Buyer may reasonably request, and (3)
Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments submitted by
Buyer at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Pre-Closing Tax
Return in the case of a separate income Tax Return of the Transferred
Companies, and at least five (5) days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Pre-Closing Tax Return in the case of a separate non-income Tax Return of
the Transferred Companies or in respect of the Transferred Assets or the
Business (in each case taking into account any applicable extensions). If
applicable, Seller shall deliver a

 



-70-  revised Pre-Closing Tax Return to Buyer before the due date for the filing
of such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions), and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed any Pre-
Closing Tax Returns.

 

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns (other than those
required to be prepared by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)(i)_)
required to be filed by the Transferred Companies, or in respect of the
Transferred Assets or the Business, and any such Tax Returns of Transferred
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Companies as
applicable, unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing that a different position
is required by applicable Law, and the parties mutually agree on the
resolution of such issue (and each party shall reasonably endeavor to reach
such mutual agreement). With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
by Buyer for or including a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (1) Buyer shall deliver to
Seller for its approval, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Tax Return in the case of an income Tax Return, and at
least ten (10) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return in
the case of a non-income Tax Return (in each case taking into account any
applicable extensions), a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which
Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)(i)_ and a copy of
such Tax Return, together with any additional information that Seller may
reasonably request and (2) Buyer shall reflect on such Tax Return any
reasonable comments, except to the extent such comments are inconsistent with
past practice (unless the parties mutually agree that a position that is
inconsistent with past practice is required by applicable Law, pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)(ii)_), submitted by Seller at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date of such Tax Return in the case of an income Tax
Return, and at least five (5) days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return in the case of a non-income Tax Return (in each case taking
into account any applicable extensions). Any Tax Return of a Transferred
Company for a Tax period that would otherwise be a Straddle Period shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on the basis that the
relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(iii) Unless otherwise required by Law (as mutually agreed to by Buyer and
Seller (and each party shall reasonably endeavor to reach such mutual
agreement)), neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including any
Transferred Company) shall file an amended Tax Return or agree to any waiver
or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes with respect to
any Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or a Straddle Period), to the extent such amendment,
waiver or extension would reasonably be expected to increase Sellers
liability for Taxes under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 

(iv) All Taxes due and payable with respect to Tax Returns described in
_Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)_ will be paid by the filer, subject to reimbursement
by the other party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_; _provided_ that, with
respect to any Tax Return described in _Section 7.08(a)(ii)_ for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period and any Tax Return described in
_Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)(i)_ that is to be filed by Buyer, Seller shall pay
any 

 



-71-  Excluded Taxes or any Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities, in each case
relating to such Tax Return, to Buyer no later than five (5) days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

(v) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to
any Tax Return prepared by Seller pursuant to _Section 7.08(a)(i)_ or
prepared by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.08(a)(ii)_ , in each case, prior to
the due date (taking into account any extension validly obtained) of such Tax
Return, such Tax Return will be filed as proposed by Seller (in the case of a
Tax Return prepared by Seller pursuant to _Section 7.08(a)(i)_ ) or as
proposed by Buyer (in the case of a Tax Return prepared by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.08(a)(ii)_ ), and any open issues shall be referred to the
Accounting Firm promptly after the filing of such Tax Return for review and
resolution (in accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.04_). If Seller and Buyer are unable to mutually agree that an item
or action is required by applicable Tax Law, such disagreement shall be
referred to the Accounting Firm promptly for review and resolution (in
accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_). Any
reimbursement or indemnification payment required under this _Section_ __ _
7.08_ shall be adjusted to reflect the resolution of the Accounting Firm.

 

(b) _Refunds_.

 

(i) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) of, any refund (including any credit in lieu of a
refund, which credit arises as a result of an overpayment and which otherwise
would have been payable in cash by the relevant Taxing Authority at
the election of the taxpayer) received or realized in cash with respect to
Taxes attributable to any Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Transfer Taxes, but
including any VAT for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section
2.06(e)_ ), including any such amounts arising by reason of amended Tax
Returns filed after the Closing Date, but only to the extent that (A) such
refund (or credit) is not the result of an event that occurred after the
Closing Date, and (B) such refund (or credit) is not attributable to, and does
not result from, a carry back or other use of any item of loss, deduction,
credit or other similar item arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period or, in the
case of a refund (or credit) of Taxes for a Straddle Period, the use of any
such item arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. In connection with the
foregoing, if Seller determines that any of the Transferred Companies is
entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim for a refund (to which
Seller would be entitled under the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
7.08(b)(i)_) of Taxes (including by filing an amended Tax Return) with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Transfer Taxes or VAT, but
including any VAT for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section
2.06(e)_ ), Seller shall be entitled, at Sellers expense, to file or make, or
to request that Buyer cause the applicable Transferred Company to file or
make, such formal or informal claim for refund, and Seller shall be entitled
to control the prosecution of such claim for refund, _provided_ that Seller
shall not take any action in connection therewith that would bind Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred Company) for a Post-Closing
Tax Period or otherwise adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Company). Buyer will

 



-72-  cooperate, and cause the Transferred Companies to cooperate, with respect to
such claim for refund, and will pay, or cause the relevant Transferred Company
to pay, to Seller the amount (including interest received from any Taxing
Authority) of any related refund (including any credit in lieu of a refund,
which credit arises as a result of an overpayment and which otherwise would
have been payable in cash by the relevant Taxing Authority at the election of
the taxpayer) (to which Seller would be entitled under the first sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.08(b)(i)_) received or realized in cash by Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof (including any Transferred Company), net of any
unreimbursed costs incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in respect of such
refund and reduced by the amount of any Taxes arising or that would arise as a
result of the receipt of such refund or interest thereon, within five (5) days
of receipt (or realization in cash) thereof. Buyer and the Transferred
Companies shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Seller
with respect to, any other refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit
received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to any Transferred
Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business. Notwithstanding any other
provision, (x) Seller shall be entitled to any refund, credit or reimbursement
for any Transfer Taxes arising from, or relating to, the Internal
Restructuring Steps, and (y) Buyer shall be entitled to any refund, credit or
reimbursement for any Transfer Taxes or VAT arising from, or relating to, any
Transfer Taxes or VAT imposed on the transfer of the Transferred Equity
Interests and the Transferred Assets to Buyer and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities by Buyer.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax basis, net operating loss, credit or
other item that reduces Taxes paid or payable that may exist in any
Transferred Company in a Post-Closing Tax Period or may be carried forward to
a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Buyer.

(c) _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(i) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) harmless from and against all liability
for Excluded Taxes; and

(ii) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies)
shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and
against: (A) for any Post-Closing Tax Period (x) all Tax liabilities (which
shall include any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, attributable to such Tax liabilities) of the Transferred Companies
and (y) all Tax liabilities (which shall include any costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to such Tax
liabilities) with respect to the Transferred Assets or the Business, in the
case of each of clauses (x) and (y), other than any such Tax liabilities that
are Excluded Taxes, (B) all liability for Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)_, (C) all Tax liabilities
(which shall include any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, attributable to such Tax liabilities) attributable to a Buyer
Tax Act, unless such Buyer Tax Act is effected with the written consent of
Seller, (D) Tax liabilities (which shall include any costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to such Tax
liabilities) attributable to any breach by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, any Transferred Company) of any covenant or
other agreement hereunder, or (E) any Taxes (which shall include any costs and

 



-73-  expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to such
Taxes) imposed with respect to the excess of, if any, (x) any amount required
to be included by Seller or any of its Affiliates in income under Section
951(a) of the Code with respect to a Transferred Company for the tax year of
Seller or such Affiliate that includes the Closing Date, over (y) the amount
that would have been required to be included by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in income under Section 951(a) of the Code with respect to a
Transferred Company for the tax year of Seller or such Affiliate that includes
the Closing Date had the taxable year of such Transferred Company ended
on the Closing Date;

(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(1) The periodic Taxes of the Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling
Affiliates that are not based on income or receipts (e.g., property Taxes)
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed based upon the ratio of the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the
entire Tax period; and

(2) Taxes of the Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling Affiliates for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than Taxes described in _Section
7.08(c)(iii)(1)_ above, shall be computed as if such Tax period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes of the
Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling Affiliates attributable to the
ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough"
entity, as if the Tax period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(iv) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 7.08(c)_ shall be made within thirty (30) days after the indemnified party
makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than
five (5) business days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are
required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

(v) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.08(c)_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. Each party shall
notify the other party if it receives notice that any Taxing Authority
proposes to treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.08(c)_ as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, or if it otherwise determines that an indemnification payment under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_ is required by applicable Tax Law to be treated
as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

(d) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) Buyer shall notify Seller within ten (10) business days of a Tax
Proceeding for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to a Transferred
Company, _provided_ that the failure to so notify Seller shall not affect
Sellers indemnification obligation under  _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_ except to
the extent of any material prejudice actually incurred by Seller.

 



-74- (ii) With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to (A) a Pre-Closing Tax
Period with respect to a Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Business (other than a Straddle Period or a Tax Proceeding with respect to any
Transfer Taxes or VAT, but including any Tax Proceeding with respect to any
VAT for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 2.06(e)_ ) or (B) a
consolidated Tax Return of which Seller or any of its subsidiaries (other than
a Transferred Company) is the common parent, Seller may choose in its sole
discretion (at its expense) to control all Tax Proceedings and may make all
decisions taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of
counsel), and, without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion,
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its
sole discretion, either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund
or contest the Tax at issue in such Tax Proceeding, _provided_ that, to the
extent such Tax Proceeding or the resolution or settlement thereof could have
an impact on Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) after the Closing Date, (x) Seller shall provide Buyer with a
timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding
and shall consult with Buyer before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax Proceeding and (y) Seller shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(iii) With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period with
respect to a Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business,
Buyer may choose in its sole discretion (at its expense) to control all Tax
Proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Proceeding (including selection of counsel), and, without limiting
the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund or contest the Tax at issue
in such Tax Proceeding, _provided_ that, to the extent such Tax Proceeding or
the resolution or settlement thereof could have an impact on Seller or any of
its Affiliates with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting in an
increase of Sellers liability for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement, (x) Buyer
shall provide Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account of
each phase of such Tax Proceeding and shall consult with Seller before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding and (y) Buyer
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(iv) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.08(d)(ii)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.08(d)(iii)_, Buyer shall exclusively control all Tax
Proceedings with respect to the Transferred Companies or otherwise relating to
the Transferred Assets or the Business. Notwithstanding anything in _Section_
__ _ 7.08(d)(ii)_ to the contrary, Buyer shall have the exclusive right to
control any Tax Proceeding described in _Section_ __ _ 7.08(d)(i)_ if Seller
fails to, or notifies Buyer in writing that Seller elects not to, defend such
Tax Proceeding.

(v) Buyer, the Transferred Companies and each of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Proceeding, which cooperation shall
include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting

recruiting agencies) not targeted at any such Persons described above and
(ii) this covenant shall not apply to any Seller Restricted Employee who is
terminated by Seller. Seller agrees that if Buyer requests that Seller waive
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.11(b)_ with respect to a Seller
Restricted Employee, Seller shall consider such request in good faith.

(c) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, Seller agrees not to, and not to permit any of
its subsidiaries to, engage

 



-78-  anywhere in the world, or own an interest in any Person who engages anywhere
in the world, in the manufacturing or sale of products that directly compete
with the Products; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall
preclude Seller or any of its subsidiaries from:

(i) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a business activity that would otherwise
violate this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (a " _Competing Business_ ") if such
Competing Business generated less than twenty percent (20%) of such Persons
consolidated annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person;

 

(ii) owning twenty percent (20%) or less of the outstanding securities of any
Person who may be engaged in the Business;

 

(iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business if (A) such
Competing Business generated twenty percent (20%) or more (but in no event
greater than forty percent (40%)) of such Persons consolidated annual
revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person and (B) Seller,
within one (1) year after the consummation of such acquisition, discontinues,
or enters into a definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of, a
sufficient portion of the Competing Business of such Person such that
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ would not operate
to restrict such ownership;

 

(iv) exercising its rights or performing or complying with its obligations
under or as contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents; or

(v) entering into or participating in a joint venture, partnership or other
strategic business relationship with any Person engaged in a Competing
Business, if such joint venture, partnership or other strategic business
relationship does not engage in the Competing Business.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.11_ are reasonable in scope and duration. The parties further
acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ are
necessary to protect Buyers significant investment in the Business, including
its goodwill. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law. If any covenant in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ is found
to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction by
a final determination of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, the
parties agree that: (i) such determination will not affect the validity or
enforceability of (A) the offending term or provision in any other situation
or in any other jurisdiction or (B) the remaining terms and provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ in any situation in any jurisdiction; (ii) the offending
term or provision will be reformed rather than voided and the Governmental
Entity making such determination will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or geographical area of any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable provision, in order to render the restrictive covenants set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; and (iii) the restrictive covenants set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ will be enforceable as so modified.

 



-79- SECTION 7.12. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each party acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
hereby is subject to the terms of each of (1) that certain confidentiality
agreement between Buyer and Seller, dated as of December 2, 2016 (the "
_Business Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (2) that certain confidentiality
agreement between Buyer and Seller, dated as of April 5, 2017 (together with
the Business Confidentiality Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "),
the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and
shall, subject to the following sentence, survive the Closing; _provided_ that
actions taken by the parties to the extent necessary in order to comply with
their respective obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ hereunder shall not
be deemed to be in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ or of the
Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not affect 
_Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ to the extent that _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ specifies
that it is subject to this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ or the Confidentiality
Agreements. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Business
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Business, the Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer acknowledges
that its obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with respect to any
and all other information provided to it by or on behalf of Seller, the
Selling Affiliates, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, concerning Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than solely with respect to the Business, the Transferred Companies,
the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) shall continue to remain
subject to the terms and conditions of the Business Confidentiality Agreement
(but subject to the term therein).

(b) For two (2) years after the Closing, unless Buyer has otherwise consented
in writing, Seller agrees to, and shall cause its subsidiaries and shall
instruct its Representatives to, retain in confidence, and not use, any and
all confidential or proprietary information to the extent relating to the
Business and the Transferred Assets (collectively, " _Confidential Business
Information_ "), and not disclose such Confidential Business Information to
any other Person;  _provided_ that Confidential Business Information shall
not include any information (i) which is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure in violation of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.12(b)_, (ii) that Seller or any of its Affiliates receives after the
Closing from a source that is not, to the knowledge of Seller, under any
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information, or (iii) that
is independently developed by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates
without reference to or use of such Confidential Business Information. In
addition, the foregoing will not prohibit Seller or its Affiliates
from disclosing Confidential Business Information which is required by
applicable Law or order of a Governmental Entity or rule or policy of any
securities exchange to be disclosed. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(x) Seller and its Affiliates currently, and, subject to _Section_ __ _
7.11(c)_, may continue following the Closing to, maintain and expand business
and commercial relationships (whether as a customer, supplier or otherwise)
with the same Persons, and engage in commercial relationships with such
Persons and with Buyer and the other Transferred Companies, and, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_, may employ, or continue to employ, individuals who
previously worked in or with the Business and possess knowledge and Know-How
used in, relating to, or arising from the Business and (y)

 



-80-  nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.12(b)_ shall prohibit or restrict the
maintenance or expansion of any such relationships or employment of any such
individuals. In addition, the foregoing shall not prohibit the use or
disclosure of such Confidential Business Information to the extent reasonably
necessary to comply with the terms of, or perform under, any of the
Transaction Documents or any Transferred Contract or Commingled Contract that
has not been assigned or transferred to Buyer or its Affiliates. Furthermore,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.12(b)_ will not prohibit any use or
disclosure in connection with the preparation and filing of financial
statements with a Governmental Entity (including the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission) or Tax Returns of Seller or its Affiliates or in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

SECTION 7.13. _Replacement of Guarantees_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Guarantee_ " means any guarantee,
letter of credit, surety bond (including any performance bond), credit
support arrangement or other assurance of payment.

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller will reasonably cooperate with
one another so that Buyer will obtain, or cause an Affiliate of Buyer to
provide or obtain, replacement Guarantees with respect to each Guarantee
issued by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller for the benefit of any Transferred
Company or with respect to any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability that
was not replaced on or prior to the Closing Date (each, an " _Existing
Guarantee_ "). Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to obtain any
necessary release of Seller and its Affiliates from such Existing Guarantees
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller.

SECTION 7.14.  _Other Covenants_. Buyer agrees to perform or comply with the
matters set forth on _Schedule 7.14(a)_ to the Disclosure Letter. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, comply with
the applicable obligations set forth on _Schedule 7.14(b)_ to the Disclosure
Letter.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Employees_

 

SECTION 8.01. _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, Buyer shall consult with Seller and obtain
Sellers consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before distributing any communications to any Employee
of the Business whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of
employment or otherwise; _provided_ that this sentence shall not apply to any
(i) offer letters or other individual communications regarding post-Closing
employment of Employees of the Business (including proposed terms of
employment, compensation and employee benefits, or role and organizational
structure) or (ii) individual conversations or communications regarding
matters not covered by any of the Transaction Documents.

 



-81- (b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than five (5) business days after the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list on _Schedule_ __ _
8.01(b)(i)_ to the Disclosure Letter containing an identification number (with
the corresponding names tying to these identification numbers to be provided
concurrently to one person Buyer specifies), date of hire, position, location,
and base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity (and, in no event later than
thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, for sales
employees, sales incentive targets, as well as actual sales incentive paid
during the prior fiscal year), employee benefit plan participation,
outstanding equity awards (including vesting schedule and exercise price, as
applicable), expatriate status and any additional information that is
necessary for Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as
of the Transfer Time, as applicable, of each individual identified by Seller
as expected to be an Employee of the Business, and Seller shall update such
information periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect new hires,
leaves of absence and employment terminations and any other material changes
thereto and provide copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer. In
addition, Seller shall periodically update _Schedule_ __ _ 1.01(b)_ to the
Disclosure Letter to reflect (i) any new hires and employment terminations
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.01(b)(iii)_ , and (ii) any other employee of
Seller and its Affiliates proposed by Seller to be an "Employee of the
Business"; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (ii), if Buyer objects to
any such addition proposed to be made to such schedule by Seller, such
addition shall be reviewed and agreed by the Vice President of Human
Resources, MITG of Seller and the Senior Vice President, HR Bus Partner
Medical of Buyer and if the Vice President of Human Resources, MITG of Seller
and the Senior Vice President, HR Bus Partner Medical of Buyer cannot agree,
then such addition shall not be included. With respect to those Transferred
Companies set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(b)(ii)_ to the Disclosure
Letter, Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to establish
or ensure continuation of (as applicable) for each such Transferred Company
payroll, human resources and employee benefit administration Contracts
and processes, effective as of or prior to the Closing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take
all actions necessary to transfer the employment of any individual who is
employed by a Transferred Company and who is not an Employee of Business to
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies), as
designated by Seller. In the event the employment of an Employee of the
Business does not automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the
occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of
the Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer, (i) Seller shall take, or cause
its respective Affiliates to take, all actions required in accordance with
applicable Law in respect of the transfer of employment of such Employees of
the Business to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and Seller shall encourage
each Employee of the Business to accept any offers of employment pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ in its communications with such individuals;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be
interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its subsidiaries to provide any such
Employee of the Business with any additional compensation or benefits or
otherwise incur any material liability; and (ii) not less than ten (10)
business days prior to the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will offer
employment, effective at 12:01 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date (the "
_Transfer Time_ "), to such Employee of the Business in accordance with this
Agreement. Offers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ shall (A) be for a
position commensurate with the skills and experience of such Employee of the
Business and at a geographic work location within fifty (50) miles of the
applicable Employee of the Business primary work location immediately prior

 



-82-  to the Closing Date (or, to the extent applicable in jurisdictions other
than the United States, within such lesser radius as is necessary to ensure
severance is not due in connection with such relocation), and (B) otherwise
comply in all respects with applicable Law (including with respect to
compensation and benefits). With respect to any Employee of the Business to
whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates is required to make an offer
of employment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_, and who, as of the
Closing Date, is on approved leave of absence from work with Seller or its
Affiliates (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "), Buyer shall offer employment
to such individual on the earliest practicable date following the return of
such individual to work with Seller and its Affiliates and otherwise on terms
and conditions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_;  _provided_ that
such employee returns to work within one hundred eighty (180) days following
the Closing Date or such later time as required by applicable Law or the terms
of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement upon presenting themselves
for duty to the Business. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence
and end of any such leave of absence. In the case of any Inactive Employee who
becomes a Transferred Employee following the Closing Date, all references
in this Agreement to (1) the Closing Date shall be deemed to be references to
the date on which such individual becomes a Transferred Employee and (2) the
Transfer Time shall be deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m., local time, on
the date that such individual becomes a Transferred Employee. In any
jurisdiction where the employment of an Employee of the Business can transfer
automatically to Buyer and its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Closing
by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer (directly or indirectly) of
the Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer, Buyer and Seller agree to take, or
cause their respective Affiliates to take, all actions required under
applicable Law and all other actions as are necessary or appropriate such
that the employment of such Employee of the Business will transfer to Buyer or
its Affiliates automatically as of the Transfer Time. Seller shall provide a
list to Buyer of each Inactive Employee no later than ten (10) business days
prior to the Closing and shall update such list as of the Closing.

(d) Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the
Selling Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the
Business for any statutory or common law severance or other
separation benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation
benefits and any other legally mandated payment obligations (including any
compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any
payments pursuant to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the
parties) and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether
related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of
(i) Buyers breach of its obligations under this  _Article_ __ _ VIII_,
including any failure of Buyer to provide to U.S. Transferred Employees the
benefits described in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(e)_, (ii) Buyer making an offer to
an Employee of the Business that does not meet the requirements of (A)
_Section 8.01(e)_ with respect to an Employee of the Business in the United
States or (B) _Section 8.01(j)(i)_ with respect to an Employee of the
Business outside of the United States (whether or not located in a Specified
Non-U.S. Jurisdiction), or (iii) any claims for severance or other separation
benefits in connection with the involuntary termination of employment by
Buyer or its Affiliates of any Transferred Employee after the Transfer Time.
Seller or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and costs
relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the Business for any
statutory or common law severance or other separation benefits, any
contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any other legally
mandated payment obligations (including any 

 



-83-  compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any
payments pursuant to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the
parties) and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether
related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, not arising out
of Buyers breach of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ or under
clause (ii) or (iii) above, including any such claim arising out of (A) the
applicable Employee of the Business refusal to accept an offer of employment
made in compliance with this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ from (or to commence
employment with), or objection to the automatic transfer of employment to,
Buyer or its Affiliates, and (B) any claims made by any Employee of the
Business in China or other jurisdictions for any statutory severance or other
separation benefits (including statutory economic compensation and statutory
compensation payable in respect of accrued but not yet taken vacation days or
other paid time off for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs)
that arise as a result of any such employee who accepts an offer of
employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates making a request that such
severance or other separation benefits be paid or provided by Seller or any of
its subsidiaries. Buyer shall not encourage any Employee of the Business
regarding a request described in the immediately preceding sentence, and in
the event an Employee of the Business asks Buyer a question regarding such
request, Buyer shall refer such Employee of the Business to an applicable
representative of Seller with respect to such request.

(e) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, Buyer or its Affiliates (i) shall provide to each
Transferred Employee a total compensation opportunity and employee benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect for such
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date;  _provided_
that Buyer shall provide such Transferred Employee no less favorable base
salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity, as applicable, than as set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_ to the Disclosure Letter (as so updated by
Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date); and (ii) shall provide each
Transferred Employee an office within a commute of no more than fifty (50)
miles from his or her office as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; 
_provided_ that, if a relocation beyond that distance is required and such
Transferred Employees employment terminates as a result of his or her desire
not to accept such a relocation, such Transferred Employee shall receive the
severance benefits at the level set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(f)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring either Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the
employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee for any period after the Closing
Date; _provided_ that such employee shall receive the severance benefits set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(f)_ if terminated under the circumstances
described therein. For avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy its obligations
under this _Section 8.01(e)_ by providing cash payments or other benefits in
lieu of equity compensation benefits.

 

(f) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, in the event of a termination of any
Transferred Employees employment by Buyer or its Affiliates without cause
(as reasonably determined by Buyer or its Affiliate), Buyer or its Affiliates
shall provide severance benefits to such Transferred Employee that are no less
favorable than those severance or termination benefits applicable to such
Transferred Employee as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(f)_ to the
Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that such severance benefits shall be provided
only if the Transferred Employee executes (and does not revoke) a release of
claims in favor of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

 



-84- (g) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (the " _Buyer Plans_
"), service with Seller and the Selling Affiliates prior to the Transfer Time
to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Business
Employee Benefit Plan covering such Transferred Employees, including for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals, in each
case, except (A) where it would result in a duplication of benefits or (B)
with respect to newly established Buyer Plans that do not provide credit for
past service to such similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates
and in which at least a comparable number of similarly situated of employees
of Buyer and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Employees or newly
hired employees) participate, (ii) waive any preexisting condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health
and other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, except to the extent
such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period would
have applied to such individual under the corresponding Listed Plan, and (iii)
provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made
or incurred prior to the Transfer Time for the plan year in which the Closing
occurs.

(h) Seller shall pay to the Transferred Employees or reimburse Buyer
for amounts Buyer or its subsidiaries pay to the Transferred Employees for
all base salary, wages, commissions or other amounts (but not including any
annual bonuses or incentives) in respect of services performed by each
Employee of the Business for Seller or its Affiliates that are earned and
accrued but unpaid as of the Transfer Time, as applicable, in each case, to be
paid as soon as administratively practicable after the Transfer Time or as
required by law, but in no event later than thirty (30) business days after
the Transfer Time. To the extent required by applicable Law, Seller shall
timely pay to the Transferred Employees all accrued but unpaid vacation,
personal and sick time (" _PTO_ ") for periods prior to the Transfer Time. If
permitted by applicable Law (and, if only permitted by applicable Law with
consent, Seller shall not be required to seek or obtain consent), Seller shall
provide Buyer with a list of all accrued but unused PTO for each Transferred
Employee and shall transfer to Buyer an amount sufficient to pay the costs of
such PTO based on each such Transferred Employees compensation at the
Transfer Time, in each case, as soon as practicable following the
Transfer Time. Buyer will cooperate in good faith with Transferred Employees
with respect to PTO commitments purchased or reserved by such Transferred
Employees prior to the applicable Transfer Time in respect of periods
occurring subsequent to such applicable Transfer Time, it being understood
that any such PTO commitments ultimately honored by Buyer shall count against
the applicable Transferred Employees paid time off accrued during his or her
service with Buyer or be unpaid.

 

(i) Subject to Seller providing all reasonably necessary support and
information in a timely manner, no later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall
establish or cause to be established (or utilize existing Buyer Plans), at its
own expense, all necessary retirement, pension, employee welfare and employee
benefit plans for Transferred Employees, as applicable. Effective as of the
Transfer Time, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be an employee of
Seller or the applicable Affiliate and shall cease to participate in any
Business Employee Benefit Plan (other than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an
active employee. Other than with respect to a government-sponsored benefit
plan, (i) Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be,

 



-85-  responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims
for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents,
(B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred
by any Transferred Employee, (C) claims for group life, travel and accident,
and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any
Transferred Employee and (D) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable
to "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee and his or her
beneficiaries and dependents, in each case, prior to or as of the Transfer
Time and (ii) Buyer shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be,
responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims
for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents,
(B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred
by any Transferred Employee, (C) claims for group life, travel and accident,
and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any
Transferred Employee and (D) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable
to "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee and his or her
beneficiaries and dependents, in each case, after the Transfer Time. Except in
the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for purposes of
this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be
incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or prescription drug
benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of the services,
materials or supplies comprising any such benefits and (2) short and long-
term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident
giving rise to such benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to
the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are
incurred on or after the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. A claim
for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred on the date
the injury giving rise to the claim occurs.

 

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ to the
contrary, during the applicable Benefits Continuation Period (or such longer
period required by applicable Law), Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide: (i)
each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee (other than a Non-U.S. Employee located in
a Specified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction) with (A) terms and conditions of employment
(including seniority and other service credit) that, individually, are no
less than as required by applicable Law, and in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior
to the Transfer Time and (B) amounts (and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, types) of compensation and benefits (including severance
and equity compensation benefits) that, individually, are no less than as
required by applicable Law and, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than
those provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer
Time (clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the " _Non-U.S. Employment Terms_");
and (ii) each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee who is located in any
jurisdiction set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(j)_ to the Disclosure Letter
(each, a " _Specified  Non-U.S. Jurisdiction_") with, at Buyers election,
either (A) the applicable Non-U.S. Employment Terms or (B) as long as Buyer
maintains each such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees base compensation or
wages and otherwise provides terms and conditions of employment (including
seniority and other service credit) as required by applicable Law,
such different standard of compensation opportunities and employee benefits
as determined by Buyer; _provided_ that, to the extent that such Non-U.S.
Transferred Employee becomes entitled to severance benefits as a result of
Buyers election to not provide the Non-U.S. Employment Terms, Buyer shall be
liable for the payment of all such severance benefits consistent with
_Sections 8.01(d)(ii)_ and 

 



-86-   _8.01(d)(iii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy its
obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence by providing cash payments or
other benefits in lieu of equity compensation benefits. Without limiting the
generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ or Buyers obligations hereunder, with
respect to Transferred Employees covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements,
effective from and after the Transfer Time, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall comply with applicable Law concerning Collective Bargaining Agreements
in the context of this Agreement.

 

(k) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply in all material
respects with all appropriate requirements and procedures in connection with
any information and consultation processes required by applicable Law in
relation to the Transaction in those jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule
8.01(k)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the " _Consultation Processes_ ") and
shall convene meetings of the appropriate Employee Representatives as soon as
reasonably practicable with a view to obtaining expeditious delivery of any
required works council or other Employee Representative opinions and
completing the Consultation Processes. Seller shall keep Buyer regularly
informed of the status of material matters relating to the Consultation
Processes, including the delivery of the opinions of any Employee
Representatives and furnishing Buyer promptly of copies of notices or details
of any substantive material communications obtained by Seller, whether orally
or in writing, as part of the Consultation Processes. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seller undertakes to inform Buyer in writing as
soon as possible (and in any event no later than two (2) business days) after
any of the Consultation Processes has been completed. Buyer agrees to
cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in
effecting the Consultation Processes, including providing such information
(including information in respect of Buyers employee benefit plans, if any)
to, and attending such meetings with, the applicable Employee Representatives,
in each case, as may be required by applicable Laws or practices or as may be
reasonably requested by Seller or such Employee Representatives or their
respective agents or advisors in connection with the Consultation Processes.

 

(l) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Time (and Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer any such permit, pass or other approval to Buyer, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and to cooperate with Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate with respect to any ongoing approval processes).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
any Collective Bargaining Agreement, in the event an applicable work permit
for an Employee of the Business is not in place with Buyer or its Affiliate
as of the Transfer Time, such Employee of the Business shall be treated as an
Inactive Employee hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall, and

efforts to obtain the applicable work permit; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Seller shall not be obligated to provide for the services of such Employee of
the Business to be made available to Buyer or any substitute for
such services.

(m) To the extent (i) permitted by applicable Law and (ii) that doing so would
not require the consent of any other Person, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to assign to Buyer and its

 



-87-  Affiliates any nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, non-competition
agreements or other restrictive covenant agreements applicable to
any Transferred Employee to the extent that such agreements relate
exclusively to the Business.

(n) As of the Transfer Time, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates
copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee required to be
provided to Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable Law or as necessary for
Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the

may be reasonably requested from time to time. Seller shall be permitted to
retain copies of such employment records, except where prohibited by
applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates shall ensure that all such records

of the European Council Directive of March 12, 2001 (2001/23/EC) (the "
_Directive_ "), relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event
of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and any
country legislation implementing the Directive and any other similar Law
(collectively, the " _Transfer Regulations_ "). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that they shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
comply with the Transfer Regulations to the extent applicable. Following the

(p) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall establish participation by the

benefit of each U.S. Transferred Employee who, as of immediately prior to the
Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller
401(k) Plans_ "). As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller
401(k) Plans shall, to the extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code,
make distributions available to Transferred Employees, and the Buyer 401(k)

rollover contribution if so directed by the Transferred Employee; _provided_
that the Transferred Employee has timely elected such rollover contribution.
As of the Closing Date, with respect to the Seller 401(k) Plans, the U.S.
Transferred Employees shall cease to participate in such Seller 401(k) Plans
and shall be fully vested in their accounts under such plans, including all
matching contributions under the 401(k) component, personal investment
accounts and Seller core contribution component, and Seller shall make a pro

May 1, 2017 and ending on the Closing Date.

(q) No later than forty-five (45) business days following the Closing, Seller
or its applicable Affiliate shall pay (i) an annual bonus (prorated through

the target amount to each Transferred Employee who is or would be eligible as
of immediately prior to the Closing to receive an annual bonus under any
Business Employee Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms thereof); and (ii) sales
incentives or commissions (prorated through the Closing Date and based on
actual performance through the Closing Date) to each Transferred Employee who
participated in any Business Employee Benefit Plan that provides for sales
incentives or commissions as of immediately prior to the Closing and who was
eligible to earn sales incentives or commissions for the
applicable performance period in which the Closing occurs.

(r) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all actions as are necessary to
provide as follows:

(i) Each outstanding option (each, a " _Seller Option_ ") to purchase ordinary
shares, par value $0.0001 (" _Seller Ordinary Shares_ "), other than any
Integration Incentive Stock Option, that is held by a Transferred Employee as
of immediately prior to the Closing shall, effective as of the Closing, become
fully vested and exercisable and shall remain outstanding for the remainder
of the term of such Seller Option.

(ii) Each outstanding Integration Incentive Stock Option held by a
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing shall remain

such Integration Incentive Stock Option to the extent the applicable
performance criteria are satisfied.

(iii) Each outstanding restricted share unit award in respect of
Seller Ordinary Shares (each, a " _Seller RSU Award_ ") that is held by a
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing and vests solely
based on continued service shall, as of the Closing, become fully vested and
shall be settled by Seller in accordance with its terms.

(iv) Each outstanding Seller RSU Award that is held by a Transferred Employee
as of immediately prior to the Closing and subject to performance-based
vesting conditions shall remain outstanding, shall vest at the end of the
performance period applicable to such Seller RSU Award to the extent the
applicable performance criteria are satisfied and shall be settled by Seller
in accordance with its terms.

(v) As of the Closing, each Employee of the Business who is eligible to
receive a long-term cash retention bonus under Sellers Retention Bonus Plan
shall become fully vested in his or her long-term cash retention bonus, which
amount shall be paid by Seller or its applicable Affiliate in accordance with
such plan.

(vi) No later than forty-five (45) business days following the Closing,
Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall pay a bonus under Sellers Long-Term
Performance Plan (prorated through the Closing Date and based on actual
performance through the Closing Date, as determined by Seller) to each
Transferred Employee who is or would be eligible to receive a bonus under
such plan pursuant to the terms thereof.

(s)  _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(s)_ to the Disclosure Letter sets forth certain
retention bonuses (the " _Retention Bonuses_ ") that may become payable on or
following the Closing Date to 

 



-89-  Employees of the Business identified on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(s)_ to the
Disclosure Letter who remain employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Retention Participant_ ").
Following the Closing, Seller shall retain all liability under such Retention
Bonuses and pay the Retention Bonuses in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, treating, for all purposes, each Retention Participants
service with Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing as service with
Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in implementing this  _Section_ __ _
8.01(s)_.

(t) In the United States, pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Buyer
and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall apply the "standard" method
for purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to any Employee of the
Business. 

(u) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any Employee of the Business or of any other employee benefit
plan.

SECTION 8.02. _Pension Plan Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within six (6) months following the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
determine the aggregate value of the underfunded pension liabilities as of
the Closing Date under the Assumed Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
8.02(a)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the absolute value of such underfunded
liabilities, the " _Aggregate Underfunded Amount_ "). The Aggregate
Underfunded Amount shall be calculated on the same basis that was used to
determine the estimate referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.13(b)(iii)_ and, if
applicable, the conversion rate from the applicable Foreign Currency to U.S.
dollars shall be the closing rate provided by Bloomberg at 5:00 a.m. New York
City time on the Closing Date.

 

(b) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date,
Buyers actuary (" _Buyer_ __ _s Actuary_ ") shall provide Sellers actuary
(" _Seller_ __ _s Actuary_ ") with its determination of the Aggregate
Underfunded Amount, together with a complete computer file and other relevant
books and records containing all relevant information used by Buyers Actuary
or otherwise reasonably requested by Sellers Actuary and in the possession of
Buyer as needed to calculate the Aggregate Underfunded Amount. The Aggregate
Underfunded Amount provided by Buyers Actuary pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall be the " _Final Aggregate Underfunded Amount_ " and
shall be final and binding upon the parties, unless prior to the close of
business on the forty-fifth (45th) day following Sellers receipt of the
information described in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_,
Seller delivers to Buyer a written notice (a " _Notice of Objection_ ")
stating that Seller believes that Buyers Actuarys calculation of the
Aggregate Underfunded Amount contains factual or mathematical errors, fails to
comply with applicable Law or otherwise fails to calculate the Aggregate
Underfunded Amount on the same basis that was used to determine the estimate
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.13(b)(iii)_, and states in reasonable detail
the basis for such belief and Sellers Actuarys proposed determination of the
Aggregate Underfunded Amount. In the event that Seller delivers a Notice of
Objection, Seller shall provide to Buyer a complete computer file and other
relevant books and records containing all relevant information used by
Sellers Actuary or otherwise reasonably requested by Buyers Actuary and in
the possession of Seller as needed to evaluate the basis of Sellers Actuarys
determination of the Aggregate Underfunded Amount.

 



-90- (c) Should Seller timely provide a Notice of Objection, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve promptly (but in any event within
fifteen (15) days following Buyers receipt of such Notice of Objection (such
period, the " _Resolution Period_ ")) any disagreements regarding the
Aggregate Underfunded Amount and, if they so resolve the disagreements, the
agreed Aggregate Underfunded Amount shall be the "Final Aggregate Underfunded
Amount" and shall be final and binding upon the parties.

 

(d) In the event that the parties cannot resolve the disagreements during the
Resolution Period, the Parties shall, within fifteen (15) days following the
Resolution Period, jointly select and engage an independent third actuary with
whom none of the parties has had a material relationship in the last two (2)
years, who shall render its determination promptly (and in any event within
thirty (30) days following its engagement) in accordance with the requirements
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ and whose determination shall be the "Final
Aggregate Underfunded Amount" and shall be final and binding upon the
parties. In no event (except for inaccuracy of the data provided) shall the
Aggregate Underfunded Amount determined by the third actuary be more than the
Aggregate Underfunded Amount claimed by Buyers Actuary or less than
the Aggregate Underfunded Amount determined by Sellers Actuary.

(e) If the Final Aggregate Underfunded Amount exceeds the amount set forth on
_Schedule 8.02(e)_ to the Disclosure Letter, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to such excess within five (5) business days following the
determination of the Final Aggregate Underfunded Amount. If the Final
Aggregate Underfunded Amount is less than the amount set forth on _Schedule
8.02(e)_ to the Disclosure Letter, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the excess of the amount set forth on _Schedule 8.02(e)_ to the Disclosure
Letter over the Final Aggregate Underfunded Amount within five (5) business
days following the determination of the Final Aggregate Underfunded Amount.

 

(f) Each of the parties shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of their
respective actuaries, and the fees, costs and expenses of the third actuary
(if any) shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

which notice is delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.01_ shall survive with respect to such Claim until such
Claim is fully and finally resolved. The covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement shall survive indefinitely.

SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article X_ , from and after the Closing Date, in addition to the
indemnification set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_, Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates

Indemnitees under clause (a) of _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or clause (a) of
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_ (as applicable) with respect to breaches of

respectively, for all Claims under clause (a) of _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or
clause (a) of  _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ (as applicable) exceeds sixty million

Indemnitees, respectively, in excess of the Deductible, but only for all such
Damages up to six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitations set forth in this _Section 10.04(a)_ shall
not apply to Damages in respect of claims for breach of any Fundamental
Representation.

 

(b) None of the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled
to indemnification under clause (a) of  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or clause (a)
of _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ (as applicable) with respect to breaches of
representations or warranties unless the Damages arising out of or resulting
from such breach (or aggregated Damages arising out of or resulting from the
same or similar facts, events or circumstances) are greater than three hundred
thousand dollars ($300,000) (it being understood that any such Claims for
amounts less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) shall be ignored
in determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _

Effect," "material adverse effect" or other similar qualifications as to
materiality (including specific monetary thresholds) contained or incorporated
in any such representation or warranty, but such qualifications, to the extent
contained or incorporated in any such representation or warranty, shall apply
for the purposes of determining whether any such inaccuracy or breach has
occurred.

 

(d) The right of the Indemnitees to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ X_ shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the
fact that, based on any facts or circumstances known, or that should have been
known, to Seller, Buyer or any other Indemnitee, including from any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, the information
provided in Sellers management presentation to Buyer, the Data Room or given
in writing to such Indemnitee prior to the date of this Agreement (except, for

(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action,
claim, demand, proceeding, assessment, fact or other circumstances upon which
a claim for indemnification (a " _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such
notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim and only to the extent
known to such Indemnified Party, such facts and information as are then
reasonably available, including the estimated amount of Damages and the
specific basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure to give prompt notice of
a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure.

 

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions_. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim by any third party within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of notice of such Claim by the Indemnifying Party,
with full authority to conduct such defense, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate in such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party will (a) permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such defense,
settlement or disposal through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party (
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such
Indemnified Party) and (b) not, in defense of any such Claim, except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement (i) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages, (ii) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof and/or
(iii) which includes any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
any third-party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any
settlement of such Claim for the payment of monetary damages unless (A) the
Indemnified Party consents in writing to such settlement or (B) the
Indemnifying Party confirms in writing to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will be responsible for indemnifying the Indemnified Party
for the Damages resulting from such Claim, to the extent provided in (and
subject to the parameters of) this _Article_ __ _ X_. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any third-party Claim without
the consent of the Indemnified Party if such third-party Claim (x) seeks an
injunction or other equitable or non-monetary relief against the Indemnified
Party (other than equitable or non-monetary relief that is incidental to
monetary damages as the primary relief sought) and not also against the
Indemnifying Party or (y) is related to or otherwise arises in connection with
any criminal matter, in which case the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in such defense
with its own counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding an election by
the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any third-party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ one separate co-counsel and
to participate in the defense in such action or proceeding, and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
separate counsel, if, based on advice from counsel, there exists any actual or
potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the third-party Claim.
In any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their
respective counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any third-party Claim
subject to this _Article X_ and keep each other informed of all significant

 



-95-  developments relating to any such third-party Claim, and provide copies of
all relevant correspondence and documentation in each case relating thereto.
In all circumstances, the Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

 

SECTION 10.07. _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery_. No Claim for
indemnification for a breach of any representation or warranty shall be made
or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written
notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable representation or warranty pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_.
This _Article_ __ _ X_, _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.08(c)_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_ provide the exclusive means by which a party may
assert and remedy claims for monetary relief pursuant to this Agreement
following the Closing Date, including any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and  _Section_
__ _ 11.12_ provides the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions
against the other party under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this _Article_ __
_ X_ with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected
in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
obligations of Buyer and Seller in respect of the allocation of Assumed
Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities shall not govern the allocation of
responsibility for liabilities between Buyer and Seller and their respective
Affiliates in respect of any future commercial arrangements unrelated to this
Agreement between the parties, such matters being addressed in the terms
thereof.

 

SECTION 10.08. _Calculation of Damages_. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Article_ __ _ X_, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently
recovers from third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to
which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
X_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party
the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), solely to avoid
duplicative recovery for the same Damage, but not in excess of any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 

SECTION 10.09. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the

instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty.

 



-97- SECTION 11.05. _Modifications and Amendments_. This Agreement shall not be

relieve such assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement), or to
a third party in connection with a sale or transfer (by means of a merger,
stock sale or otherwise) of all or substantially all of such partys business.
Other than as explicitly set forth herein, including in _Sections_ __ _
