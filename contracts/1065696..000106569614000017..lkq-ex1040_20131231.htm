AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 2013 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and among Keystone Automotive Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), LKQ Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), KAH Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), the undersigned
stockholders of the Company (the "Stockholder Parties"), and Sphere Capital,
LLC - Series A, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as the
representative of the Equityholders (the "Equityholders Representative").
(Unless the context otherwise makes clear, capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in ARTICLE XI.)

BACKGROUND

A. This Agreement constitutes an agreement of merger, as such term is used in
Section 251(b) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger") in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Company will
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

B. A special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has unanimously recommended that the Board approve this Agreement and declare
its advisability to the Company and the Stockholders.

C. The Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement
and declaring its advisability, (ii) approving the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, (iii) determining that the terms of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, advisable and in
the best interests of, the Company and the Stockholders, (iv) directing that
this Agreement be submitted to the Stockholders for consideration for adoption
or rejection and (v) recommending that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement.

D. The boards of directors of both Parent and Merger Sub have each unanimously
adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and authorizing Parent
and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger.

E. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and prescribe various conditions to the
Merger as provided herein.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the Parties
hereby agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



1.1. The Merger. At the Effective Time, and subject to and on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, the Company and
Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which: (a) Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, (b) the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by
the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware, and (c) the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its properties, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and immunities, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.2. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take place as
promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days, following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) at the offices of
KandL Gates LLP, 70 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois or on such other date
or place as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent;
provided that the Closing shall not take place earlier than January 3, 2014.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date."

1.3. Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall file with the
Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") duly executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to give
full effect to the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State,
or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
of the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and immunities of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
Applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to be Keystone Automotive Holdings, Inc. until amended in accordance
with Applicable Law and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
Keystone Automotive Holdings, Inc. until amended in accordance with Applicable
Law.





 1.6. Directors and Officers. The members of the board of directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, and the officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, in each case to hold
office until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to be officers of the Company at the Effective
Time.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION



2.1. Conversion of Company Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub or on
the part of any other Person:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.2, each share
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted automatically into and thereafter represent solely the
right to receive the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration and the Subsequent
Payments to be made with respect thereto as provided in Section 2.4(f) (all
such amounts, taken together, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). From and
after the Effective Time, all such shares of Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

(b) Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Common Stock owned by Parent, or by any other direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
payment or other consideration shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into and become one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that, at the Effective Time,
Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Surviving Corporation's common stock.

2.2. Dissenting Shares. Shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled to receive the fair value of such shares of Common
Stock as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall







cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal under the DGCL.
If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal, each such share of Common
Stock shall be treated as if it had been converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as and when provided
in Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
(a) prompt notice of (i) any demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company, but in any event not later than one (1) day after
such demand is received by the Company, (ii) withdrawals of such demands, and
(iii) any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company in connection with such demands, and (b) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by
Applicable Law, make any payment with respect to any such demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands without Parent's prior
written consent.

2.3. Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock; and Restricted Stock Units.

(a) Treatment of Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each Stock Option that has not expired and is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to become or otherwise be deemed fully vested at
such time and to be canceled and converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive payment of the Initial Stock Option Cancellation Payment and
the Subsequent Payments to be made with respect thereto as provided in Section
2.4(f).

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause each share of Restricted Stock that is unvested and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time to become or otherwise be deemed fully
vested Common Stock at such time and, accordingly, each such share shall be
converted automatically into and thereafter represent solely the right to
receive the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration and the Subsequent Payments
with respect thereto as provided in Section 2.4(f).

(c) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause each Restricted Stock Unit that is unvested and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become or otherwise be
deemed fully vested at such time and to be canceled and converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive payment of the Initial Per Share
Merger Consideration and the Subsequent Payments with respect thereto as
provided in Section 2.4(f).

(d) Company Equity Incentive Plan. After the Effective Time, the Company
Equity Incentive Plan shall be terminated and no further Stock Options, shares
of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or other rights with respect to
Common Stock shall be granted thereunder. 



2.4. Payments to the Equityholders.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall distribute to each
Stockholder of record (including holders of Restricted Stock) a customary
letter of transmittal in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
(the "Letter of Transmittal") for use in surrendering the Certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder (or in lieu
thereof an Affidavit of Loss as provided in Section 2.4(d)) in exchange for
the payments provided for in this Agreement.

(b) Each Stockholder who has, prior to the Effective Time, properly completed,
executed and delivered to the Company a Letter of Transmittal and the
Certificate(s) evidencing such Stockholder's shares of Common Stock (or an
Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled to receive from Parent on
the Closing Date, and Parent shall pay to such Stockholder on the Closing
Date, an amount equal to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied
by the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Certificate
surrendered (or referred to in the Affidavit of Loss delivered in lieu
thereof), such payments to be made by check or by wire transfer as requested
by such Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered by such
Stockholder; provided, however, that with respect to the holders of Restricted
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, such payments shall be made
through the Company's or its applicable Subsidiary's payroll account as
provided in Section 2.4(e).

(c) With respect to any Stockholder who has not properly completed, executed
and delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Company prior to the Effective
Time, or who has failed to deliver the Certificate(s) evidencing such
Stockholder's shares of Common Stock (or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu
thereof), Parent shall pay to the Equityholders Representative at the Closing
an amount equal to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by
the total number of shares of Common Stock held by all such Stockholders
(other than Dissenting Shares), such funds to be held by the Equityholders
Representative (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar
Laws) for further payment to each such Stockholder when and as such
Stockholder delivers a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
and the Certificate(s) evidencing such Stockholder's shares of Common Stock
(or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) to the Equityholders Representative
(who shall promptly thereafter deliver such documents to Parent), at which
time such Stockholder shall be entitled to receive from the funds held by the
Equityholders Representative the same amount (payable in the same manner,
except with respect to shares of Restricted Stock, which shall be payable as
provided in Section 2.4(e)) as such Stockholder would have received from
Parent under Section 2.4(b) if such Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s)
(or Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) had been delivered to the Company prior
to the Effective Time.

(d) If any Certificate which formerly represented shares of Common Stock held
by any Stockholder shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, such Stockholder
may, in lieu of delivering such Certificate with the Letter of Transmittal
delivered in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c), complete,
execute and deliver an affidavit of loss in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, including customary indemnity provisions (an "Affidavit of Loss").

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event not later than the first regular payroll that occurs not earlier than
three (3) Business Days







following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay through the
Company's or its applicable Subsidiary's payroll account, in accordance with
its regular payroll practices (and subject to all applicable payroll Taxes and
withholding Taxes) to (i) each former holder of a Stock Option who has
delivered an Option Consent Agreement, the Initial Stock Option Cancellation
Payment, (ii) each holder of Restricted Stock, the portion of the Unpaid Class
B Dividends specified by the Company not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, (iii) each applicable Employee, the amount of
Transaction Expenses specified by the Company for such Employee not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and (iv) each former holder
of shares of Restricted Stock and each former holder of Restricted Stock Units
who has delivered a Restricted Stock Unit Consent Agreement an amount in cash
equal to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number
of outstanding shares of Restricted Stock (or number of Restricted Stock
Units) held by such holder of Restricted Stock (or Restricted Stock Units)
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company has accrued, or shall

2.6. Closing Net Working Capital and Net Closing Cash Adjustments.

(a) No less than four (4) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the "Estimated
Statement"), duly executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimate of the
Closing Net Working Capital as of the anticipated Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital") and of the Net Closing Cash as of the
anticipated Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Cash"). The Estimated
Statement shall be based on the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and shall be prepared in good faith and in accordance with the
Accounting Conventions.

(b) Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Equityholders Representative a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Parent's determination of Closing Net Working
Capital and Net Closing Cash showing in reasonable detail any and all changes
reflected therein from the amounts reflected in the Estimated Statement of
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash











delivered pursuant to Section 2.6(a). The Closing Statement shall be based on
the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be
prepared in good faith and in accordance with the Accounting Conventions.

(c) The Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the
Equityholders Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, delivers to
Parent a written notice of disagreement with the Closing Statement within
seventy-five (75) days following the receipt thereof. Such written notice
shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail,
identifying the specific items as to which the Equityholders Representative
disagrees and shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation.
During such seventy-five (75) day period, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide the Equityholders Representative
and the Equityholders Representative's advisors with on-site access and access
via telephone and e-mail communications and transmissions during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice to all relevant books and records
and employees (including key accounting and finance personnel) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to review
the matters and information used to prepare and to support the Closing
Statement, all in a manner not unreasonably interfering with the business of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and if and to the extent that
such access is requested but not provided, such seventy-five (75) day review
period shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for each full day that such
access is requested but not provided. If the Equityholders Representative
delivers a notice of disagreement in a timely manner, then the Equityholders
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, and Parent shall attempt to
resolve all such matters identified in such notice. If the Equityholders
Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all such disagreements within
thirty (30) days after the receipt by Parent of the notice of disagreement (or
such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the Equityholders
Representative), then the remaining disputed matters shall be promptly
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for binding resolution, and the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be directed by Parent and the Equityholders
Representative to resolve the unresolved objections as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The Accounting Arbitrator will consider only those items and
amounts set forth on the Closing Statement as to which Parent and the
Equityholders Representative have disagreed and shall resolve such
disagreements in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a written report containing a final
Closing Statement setting forth its determination of Closing Net Working
Capital and Net Closing Cash, which determination shall be final and binding
upon Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Equityholders Representative and
the Equityholders. Any upfront or other fees or expenses charged by the
Accounting Arbitrator prior to the final determination shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Equityholders
Representative, subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 2.6(c).
The final aggregate fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in
connection with the determination of the disputed items (including any upfront
or other fees previously paid) shall be paid by Parent and by the
Equityholders Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders, to be paid from
the Representative Holdback Amount) based on the relative success of their
positions as compared to the final determination of the Accounting Arbitrator.
By way of example, if Parent has taken the position that the Closing Net
Working Capital was $1,000,000 less than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital and the Equityholders Representative has taken the position that the
Closing Net Working Capital was $500,000 greater than the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital (and the parties had otherwise agreed on Net Closing Cash)
and the Accounting Arbitrator finally



determines that the Closing Net Working Capital was equal to the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then Parent shall ultimately pay two thirds (2/3)
of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and the Equityholders
Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) shall ultimately pay one third
(1/3) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. To the extent
either Parent or the Equityholders Representative has made payments to the
Accounting Arbitrator in excess of the amount of fees and expenses ultimately
determined to be payable by such Party, the other Party shall reimburse such
first Party in an amount equal to such excess. Parent and the Equityholders
Representative shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis
to all requests for information or access to documents or personnel made by
the Accounting Arbitrator, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith
resolve all disputes relating to the Closing Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

(d) If the aggregate amount of Closing Net Working Capital plus Net Closing
Cash as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.6(c) is less than the
aggregate amount of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital plus Estimated
Closing Cash, then the amount of such difference (the "WC Deficiency") shall
be paid in the following sequential manner: (i) to the extent there is a WC
Estimated Surplus, the Equityholders Representative shall pay to Parent the WC
Deficiency from the WC Estimated Surplus, and any remaining portion of the WC
Estimated Surplus shall be paid to the Equityholders pursuant to Section
2.6(e); (ii) if the WC Deficiency exceeds the WC Estimated Surplus (if any)
the amount of the Promissory Note shall be reduced by the amount of the
difference between the WC Deficiency and the WC Estimated Surplus (if any) up
to an amount equal to $1,500,000 (and the Surviving Corporation and
Equityholders Representative shall amend the Promissory Note to reflect the
reduced amount); (iii) to the extent the WC Deficiency exceeds the combined
amount of the WC Estimated Surplus (if any) plus $1,500,000, then the
Equityholders Representative shall pay to Parent from the remaining
Representative Holdback Amount an amount in cash equal to such excess; and
(iv) to the extent the WC Deficiency exceeds the combined amount of the WC
Estimated Surplus (if any) plus $1,500,000 plus the remaining Representative
Holdback Amount, then the Stockholder Parties shall pay (which obligation
shall be on a several basis based on their respective Indemnity Pro Rata
Share) to Parent an amount in cash equal to such excess. If the aggregate
amount of Closing Net Working Capital plus Net Closing Cash as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.6(c) is greater than the aggregate
amount of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital plus Estimated Closing Cash,
then the amount of such difference shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the Equityholders Representative (for further payment to the
Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.6(e)) and the Equityholders
Representative shall distribute the WC Estimated Surplus to the Equityholders
in accordance with Section 2.6(e). Any payments required to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.6(d) shall be made by wire transfer within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital and Net
Closing Cash.

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation is obligated to make payments to
the Equityholders Representative pursuant to Section 2.6(d), then, subject to
Section 12.1(b), the Equityholders Representative shall disburse and pay the
aggregate amount paid to it pursuant to Section 2.6(d) to the Equityholders in
accordance with their respective Equity Ownership Percentages and, with
respect to the Stockholders, the payment instructions set forth in their
respective Letters of Transmittal.



 2.7. Representative Holdback Amount and WC Estimated Surplus.

(a) If and to the extent that any portion of the Representative Holdback
Amount remains unspent at the time that the final payment is made under the
Promissory Note, then, Subject to Section 12.1(b), the Equityholders
Representative shall pay over such remaining portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount at such time to the Equityholders in the same manner as if
such funds were being paid from payments received under the Promissory Note.

(b) The Equityholders Representative shall retain the WC Estimated Surplus (if
any) on behalf of the Equityholders and shall distribute the WC Estimated
Surplus to the applicable parties pursuant to and in accordance with Section
2.6(d).

2.8. Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and any applicable Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement
any withholding Taxes or other amounts required by Law to be deducted and
withheld. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person with respect to whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

2.9. Tax Deductions. It is the intent of the Parties that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Tax Law, all income Tax deductions with respect to, or
resulting from, the payment of any Transaction Expenses, the Initial Stock
Option Cancellation Payments, the payments to the holders of Restricted Stock
and Restricted Stock Units, the payment of the Closing Bank Debt at Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax deductions that may be
available with respect to the acceleration of original issue discount, any
deferred underwriting fees or expenses, any deferred sponsor transaction fees
and any other deferred financing fees or costs in connection with the
repayment of the Closing Bank Debt) and any payments to the former holders of
Stock Options, shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units in
connection with the Closing shall be deducted by the Company in a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. The Company shall take all such deductions in the final Tax
Returns of the Company for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date, and
Parent shall not take any action, or permit the Surviving Corporation to take
any action, inconsistent therewith.

before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (pre-Closing), the Surviving Corporation
(post-Closing) or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions
relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact
the economic or business benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

6.4. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or manager
(as applicable), officer, fiduciary and agent of the Company and of each of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Covered Persons"), respectively, to the same
extent as such Covered Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the
Company and each such Subsidiary pursuant to the Constitutional Documents of
the Company and each such Subsidiary, respectively, against all costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with
any Legal Action (whether such Legal Action arises before or after the
Effective Time but with respect to any act or omission of such Covered Person
occurring prior to the Effective Time) arising out of or pertaining to any
action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director or manager (as
applicable), fiduciary or agent of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, and which Legal Action is first filed, brought
and asserted before the date that is six (6) years after the Effective Time.
In the event of any such Legal Action, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, advance, pay or reimburse the fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Covered Persons to the same extent and
in the same manner as provided under the Constitutional Documents of the
Company and each such Subsidiary, respectively, as of the date hereof and to
cooperate in the defense of any such Legal Action with such counsel; provided
that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation; and
provided, further, that in the event that any claim for indemnification or for
the advancement, payment or reimbursement of expenses is asserted or made
within such six (6)-year period, all rights to indemnification or the
advancement, payment or reimbursement of expenses in respect of such claim
shall continue until the disposition of such claim.

(b) Without limiting the obligations set forth in Section 6.4(a), for a period
of six (6) years following the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, make any changes
to the provisions of their Constitutional Documents or to the provisions of
the employment agreements and indemnification agreements with Covered Persons
listed respectively in Sections 3.13(a)(iii) and 3.13(a)(x) the Disclosure
Letter or provided to Parent prior to the date hereof, in each case relating
to the indemnification and exculpation of any Covered Person, that would
adversely affect the right of such Covered Person to claim indemnification
from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries under the terms of such
Constitutional Documents, employment agreements or indemnification agreements
as in effect on the date hereof for acts taken prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) the Surviving







Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, honor all such
indemnification and exculpation obligations thereunder (including with respect
to the advancement of expenses).

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a prepaid
noncancellable run-off directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
covering the Covered Persons for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date with coverage in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
existing coverage of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement with a deductible not more than the deductible under the existing
coverage.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, as applicable, each Covered Person and the
representatives of each Covered Person. For a period of six (6) years
following the Closing, in the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries merges or consolidates with or transfers or assigns all or
substantially all of its assets to any other Person, then proper provision
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section
6.4.

(e) The rights under this Section 6.4 shall be in addition to any rights that
any Covered Person may have at common law or otherwise and shall remain in
full force and effect following the Closing.

6.5. Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a) Parent shall provide to the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries benefit plans, programs and arrangements with benefits (other
than equity-based awards) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent as of the Closing
Date. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate or levels of
benefits or entitlement to benefits under Parent's or the Surviving
Corporation's benefit plans, programs and arrangements ("Parent Benefit
Plans"), each such employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date (except to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the
same period of service) and any pre-existing condition, actively-at-work, or
similar requirement under any such benefit plans, programs or arrangements
shall be waived by the plan sponsor with respect to such employees to the
extent allowed thereunder and under Applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall permit Parent and its Representatives to perform due
diligence with respect to the 401(k) plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "401(k) Plan"), including providing Parent with (i) access to all benefit
plan administrators, record keepers, custodians, agents and advisers, (ii)
evidence of the 401(k) Plan's tax-qualified status and timely IRS Form 5500
filings, (iii) such documentation that will allow Parent to determine the
amount, if any, of fees, loads or other charges that will be triggered by the
ceasing of new contributions to the 401(k) Plan or otherwise by virtue of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) such other documentation as Parent
shall reasonably request with respect to the 401(k) Plan. If, and only if,
requested in writing by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the







Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all
actions necessary or appropriate to terminate the 401(k) Plan not later than
the day prior to the Closing Date and, in connection therewith, the Company
shall, not later than the day prior to the Closing Date:

(i) (1) amend the 401(k) Plan to fully vest all accounts of all participants
in the 401(k) Plan and to provide for the distribution of all such accounts,
and (2) amend the 401(k) Plan to bring it into compliance with current
Applicable Law (the form and substance of which amendments shall be subject to
the prior review of Parent); and

(ii) deliver to Parent a duly executed plan amendment and resolutions of the
Company's board of directors reflecting the termination of the 401(k) Plan and
such related amendments to the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
documents shall be subject to the prior review of Parent).

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary
or other rights in any Employee or other service provider of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, including rights in respect of any benefits that may
be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or
limitation on the ability to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) be interpreted as requiring the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing to
continue to employ any particular Employee or other service provider of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any specified period of time.

6.6. Preservation of Records. Parent agrees that it shall not, for a period of
at least six (6) years following the Closing Date, destroy or cause to be
destroyed, or permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
destroy or cause to be destroyed, any material books or records relating to
the pre-Closing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without
first obtaining the consent of the Equityholders Representative (or providing
to the Equityholders Representative notice of such intent and a reasonable
opportunity to copy such books or records, at the Equityholders' expense, at
least thirty (30) days prior to such destruction).

6.7. Outstanding Letters of Credit. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
violation of any Letters of Credit Agreement as a result of any failure of
Parent to replace any Letter of Credit in connection with the termination of
the Revolving Credit Facility shall not constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement, cause any condition precedent
set forth in Section 7.2 not to be satisfied or give rise to any claim for
indemnification under Section 9.2(a).

6.8. Director Resignations. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause
each member of the Board and the board of directors or managers of its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver a letter, which shall not be revoked or
amended prior to the Closing, effectuating his or her resignation as a member
of the Board or board of directors or managers of one of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, effective immediately prior to, and conditional on, the
Closing.

6.9. Notice of Certain Events. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company, of the following:





(a) Any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (i) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, with respect to the Company, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, or, with respect to Parent, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect (ii) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any
representation or warranty made by such Party not being true and correct in
any material respect or (iii) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected
to result in, the failure of any of the conditions of such Party set forth in
Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied.

(b) Any notice or other communication to such Party from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the

Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Any Legal Actions commenced or, to the Company's Knowledge or Parent's
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such Party that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Sections 3.14, 4.5 or 5.5 that
relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Parent's or the Company's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.9
shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty
or agreement given or made by the Company or Parent, respectively, in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Letter.

6.10. No Solicitation of Other Bids.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Stockholder Party shall, and shall not
authorize or permit any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company and each Stockholder Party shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates and all of its and
their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The Company and each Stockholder Party agrees that the rights and remedies
for noncompliance with this Section 6.10 shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Parent and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Parent. 



6.11. Employee Non-Solicit.

(a) Each Stockholder Party agrees that during the period ending on the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, such Stockholder Party shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (other than those of its portfolio companies that
have not been (i) provided any employee information or other confidential
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) purposely
influenced or caused to engage in conduct that would otherwise violate this
Section 6.11(a)) not to, in any manner, directly or indirectly, induce or
attempt to induce any member of the senior management team or department head
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Key Employee to terminate or
abandon his or her employment or engagement for any purpose whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall preclude the
hiring of any such Person (i) who responds to a general solicitation of
employment through an advertisement not targeted specifically at the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective employees, (ii) who contacts a
Stockholder Party on his or her own initiative without any solicitation by
such Stockholder Party or (iii) who has been terminated by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Closing or who has not been employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case for a period of at least six
(6) months prior to such solicitation.

(b) If, at any time of enforcement of this Section 6.11, a court or an
arbitrator holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that the maximum period, scope
or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted
for the stated period, scope or area and that the court or arbitrator shall be
allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum
period, scope and area permitted by Applicable Law.

(c) Without limiting the right of Parent to pursue all other legal and
equitable rights available to it for violation of this Section 6.11 by any of
the Stockholder Parties or their Affiliates, it is agreed that other remedies
cannot fully compensate Parent or the Surviving Corporation for such a
violation and that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each be entitled
to injunctive relief to prevent violation or continuing violation thereof.

6.12. Transfer of Common Stock; Voting; Company Stockholder Approval.

(a) Each Stockholder Party covenants that prior to the Closing, such
Stockholder Party shall not (i) sell, transfer, mortgage, pledge, otherwise

proxy or other right to vote any shares of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder Party or over which such Stockholder Party exercises voting power.

of directors, shall, in accordance with Applicable Law, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the close of business on the second

executed written consent, the Stockholder Approval. Promptly following receipt
of such written consent, the Company shall cause its Secretary to deliver a
copy of such written consent to Parent.







(c) Each Stockholder Party hereby irrevocably waives any dissenters' rights,
appraisal rights or similar right that they may have under Applicable Law,
including under Section 262 of the DGCL, in connection with the Merger and

Common Stock held by such Stockholder Party. Upon approving the Merger, Sphere

Agreement) pursuant to and in accordance with the Section 3(c) of the
Stockholder Agreement requiring the stockholders party to the Stockholder
Agreement to: (x) vote all of the shares of the Company's capital stock owned
by them in favor of adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger and (y)
waive any dissenters' rights, appraisal rights or similar rights which they
may have under Applicable Law, including under Section 262 of the DGCL.

bonus plan of the Company for fiscal year 2013 as in effect as of the date
hereof and shall perform its obligations to pay bonuses thereunder to the
Persons eligible for bonuses under such plan in accordance with the terms of

aggregate amount of all such bonuses awarded under such plan shall not be less
than the aggregate amount accrued for such bonuses and included in the

no later than seventy-five (75) days following the Closing.

its fund investors, sufficient to meet its indemnification obligations under
this Agreement.

6.16. Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take
such actions, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent, as may be
necessary to cause a stockholder vote, that if approved, would cause all
payments made to any "disqualified individual" who has signed a 280G waiver
that would otherwise constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G
of the Code as a result of the Merger to satisfy the stockholder approval
exemption under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, including providing a
form of waiver of payments or benefits to each individual who is a
"disqualified individual" of the Company and that may otherwise be entitled to
receive "excess parachute payments" as a result of the Merger (as those terms
are defined under Section 280G of the Code) (a "280G Waiver"), preparing a
Section 280G of the Code disclosure statement, and seeking the execution of
the 280G Waiver and the requisite stockholder approval.

6.17. Transfer of Title. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries the title of any

Disclosure Letter, and to record with each applicable Governmental Entity each
new deed reflecting the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as the legal owner
of such Owned Real Property as a result of such transfer of title, in each
case prior to the Closing. If any



such transfer or recording has not been completed prior to the Closing, the
Equityholders Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
following the Closing to effect such transfer or recording as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing.

6.18. Closing Bank Debt. The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, a
payoff letter or payoff letters with respect to the Closing Bank Debt, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser (the "Payoff Letters"),
which Payoff Letters shall indicate (a) the amount of Closing Bank Debt that
is to be repaid to the lenders thereunder at the Closing, and (b) that upon
repayment of such amount that (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
relieved of any obligations thereunder, (ii) the Senior Credit Facilities and
related agreements shall be terminated (except for provisions thereunder that
customarily survive termination), and (iii) all of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' assets and properties shall be free from any and all Liens
(including mortgages) related thereto upon repayment of such amount.

Surviving Corporation agree that, effective as of the Closing, all agreements
between such Stockholder Party or any of its Affiliates and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated and each party thereto
shall be released from any and all obligations, claims, and causes of action
against the other party thereto, except in each case for payments which are
specified, or any obligations that are required to be performed on or after

TERMINATION



8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at
any time prior to the Closing (in all cases, by action of the respective
boards of directors of the terminating Party or Parties) regardless of whether
this Agreement and/or the Merger have been approved by the Stockholders:

(a) by written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Closing has not occurred by January 31, 2014 (or such later date as
shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the Company, the Equityholders
Representative and Parent) (the "Outside Date"), provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation
hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the Termination Date and such action or failure constitutes
a breach of this Agreement;

(ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued a final non-appealable order or taken any other action prohibiting
the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that the terms of this
Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to the terminating Party (A) if such
order or action was caused by the action or the failure to act of the
terminating Party and such action or failure constitutes a breach of this
Agreement by such Party or (B) such terminating Party did not use its
commercially reasonable









efforts to oppose any such order or action or to have such governmental order
vacated or made inapplicable to this Agreement; or

(iii) there shall be any Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity that in the opinion of
counsel of the terminating Party would make consummation of the Merger
illegal.

(c) by Parent if:

(i) there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted, promulgated or
issued or deemed applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which
would (A) prohibit Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's ownership or
operation of any portion of the business of the Surviving Corporation, or (B)
compel Parent, the Company (pre-Closing) or the Surviving Corporation (post-
Closing) to dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the Merger, any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent;

(ii) it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement,
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company and, as a result of
such breach, the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2, as the case may
be, would not then be satisfied; provided, however, that if such breach is
curable by the Company prior to the Outside Date through the exercise of its
commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(c)(ii) prior to the earlier of the Outside Date or that
date which is fifteen (15) days following the Company's receipt of written
notice from Parent of such breach, it being understood that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(ii) if such breach by
the Company is cured within such fifteen (15)-day period so that such
conditions would then be satisfied; or

(iii) the Company has not delivered evidence that the Stockholder Approval has
been obtained within twenty four (24) hours from the execution of this
Agreement provided that the Company has not delivered evidence of the
Stockholder Approval at the time of written notice of termination by Parent.

(d) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 or 7.3, as the case may be, would not then be satisfied; provided,
however, that if such breach is curable by Parent prior to the Outside Date
through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) prior to the
earlier of the Outside Date or that date which is fifteen (15) days following
Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach, it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d) if such breach by Parent is cured within such fifteen (15)-day
period so that such conditions would then be satisfied.





8.2. Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.2,
any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of such termination by the
terminating Party to the other Parties. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, except that (a) this Section 8.2 and ARTICLE XII
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall
relieve any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified as provided in Section 9.3(a) from
and against any and all Losses incurred, suffered or paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to,
in connection with, or arising from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty regarding the Company set
forth in Article III or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant hereto or thereto;

(ii) any breach by the Company of, or failure by the Company to perform,
fulfill or comply with any covenant set forth herein to be performed,
fulfilled or complied with by the Company prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) any Transaction Expenses or any Indebtedness of the Company that are not

(iv) any Legal Action instituted by a Stockholder, Option Holder, or holder of

any of their Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or

(v) any act done or omitted hereunder by the Equityholders Representation
while acting in bad faith.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, each Stockholder Party
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and the Surviving Corporation
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of them directly or
indirectly as a result of, with respect to, in connection with, or arising
from:



(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of such Stockholder Party
contained in Article IV or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of such
Stockholder Party pursuant hereto or thereto; or

(ii) any breach by such Stockholder Party of, or failure by such Stockholder
Party to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant set forth herein to be

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equityholders Group Members against
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of them directly or indirectly
as a result of, with respect to, in connection with, or arising from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in Article V or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant hereto or thereto; or

(ii) any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of, or failure by such Parent or

(d) For purposes of this Article IX, if any representation or warranty of a
Party contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered hereunder
is qualified in any respect by materiality, in all material respects, Material
Adverse Effect or words of like import, such materiality, in all material
respects, or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers or other qualifiers of like
import shall be ignored in determining whether a breach of any representation
or warranty has occurred and in determining the amount of any resulting Loss.

9.3. Limitations.

(a) Any indemnification for Losses by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 10.1(a) shall first be required to be
recovered by a reduction in amounts owed under the Promissory Note. If and to
the extent that it is not possible to satisfy any Losses by reducing the
amounts owed under the Promissory Note at any time for any reason and the
Equityholders Representative has not satisfied such Losses by paying to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation funds in the amount of such Losses that were
withheld by it from Equityholders pursuant to Section 12.1(b), then the
Stockholder Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for such Losses severally based on their respective
Indemnity Pro Rata Shares.

(b) No claims shall be made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses (other than Losses incurred as a result of inaccuracies or
breaches of the Company Fundamental Representations) for which Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are entitled to seek to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(i) exceeds $3,500,000, at which time Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount in excess of
such amount, subject to the other limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX.







(c) From and after the time that the claims made by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for indemnification exceed $3,500,000, no claims for
indemnification may be made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(i) for any individual item or series of related items where the
Losses (other than Losses incurred as a result of inaccuracies or breaches of
the Company Fundamental Representations) with respect to such item or series
of related items (in the aggregate ) are less than $50,000.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
amount of any and all payments required to be made by all Equityholders
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX (other than any amounts owed as a result of a
breach of Section 10.5(b)) and ARTICLE X, by means of a reduction of the
principal amount of the Promissory Note in accordance with this Agreement or
otherwise, shall not exceed Forty Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000), and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be entitled to any
indemnification under this ARTICLE IX and ARTICLE X in excess of such amount.

(e) All indemnification payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be
made on an after-tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the Losses incurred or
suffered by an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of such Losses shall be
(i) increased to take into account any additional Tax cost incurred by such
Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of applicable indemnification
payments hereunder and (ii) decreased to take into account any deduction,
credit or other Tax benefit actually realized by such Indemnified Party with
respect to the receipt of applicable indemnification payments hereunder. In
computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
applicable indemnification payments hereunder or the incurrence or payment
relating to any Losses; provided that, if any such Tax cost or Tax benefit is
not realized in the taxable period during which the Indemnifying Party makes
an indemnification payment or the Indemnified Party incurs any Losses, the
Parties shall thereafter make payments to one another at the end of each
subsequent taxable period to reflect the net Tax costs or Tax benefits
realized by the Parties in each such subsequent taxable period.

(f) Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of any Losses for which it seeks
indemnification under this ARTICLE IX shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses, including seeking all available
insurance; provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to
initiate litigation against any then-current customer, supplier, vendor or
other Person (in each case, other than an insurance provider) having a
business relationship with such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

(g) The Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated after
giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party from insurance providers under available insurance policies, net of (i)
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to collection from such
insurers, (ii) any deductibles associates therewith and (iii) any increase in
premiums resulting therefrom.

(h) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be





entitled to recover the amount of any Losses suffered by such Indemnified
Party more than once, regardless of whether such Losses may be as a result of
a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be able
to recover any Loss for which it is otherwise entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement if such Loss has already been taken into account in
determining the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.6.

(i) Except for claims for injunctive and other equitable relief, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for money damages for any matters
relating to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this
ARTICLE IX. No officer, director, manager, employee, Affiliate, advisor or
other representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
Liability under or with respect to this Agreement solely in their capacity as
such.

(j) No party shall be entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to any
Losses that are in the nature of exemplary or punitive damages (except to the
extent such damages are awarded in a Third-Party Claim).

(k) The limitations on indemnification contained in this Section 9.3 shall not
apply in the case of fraud or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party.

9.4. Procedures.

(a) If any Party believes at any time that it is entitled to be indemnified
under this ARTICLE IX, such Party (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly
deliver to (i) the Equityholders Representative, in the case of claims for
indemnification being asserted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and
(ii) Parent, in the case of claims for indemnification being asserted by the
Equityholders Representative, a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") that (x)
states that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly incurred Losses and the
amount thereof, or reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur Losses,
for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, and the estimated amount thereof, and (y) specifies in reasonable
detail, to the extent practicable, each individual item of Loss included in
the amount so stated, the date (if any) such item was paid or properly
incurred, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or claim
to which each such item is related and, to the extent computable, the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in delivering a Claim Certificate shall diminish the rights
of the Indemnified Party to be indemnified hereunder except to the extent that
the delay shall increase the amount of such claim or Loss, and then only to
such extent.

(b) If the Equityholders Representative, in the case of indemnification claims
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or Parent, in the case of
indemnification claims by the Equityholders Representative (in either case,
the "Indemnifying Party") objects to a claim of an Indemnified Party in
respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim Certificate, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver a written notice to such effect to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim
Certificate by the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the







Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon their respective rights within thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Indemnified Party of such written objection with respect to each of such
claims to which the Indemnifying Party has objected. If the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party agree with respect to any of such claims, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a
memorandum setting forth such agreement. If, as a result of such agreement,
Parent is entitled to have the principal amount of the Promissory Note
reduced, the Equityholders Representative shall promptly execute an amendment
to the Promissory Note reflecting such reduction. Should the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party fail to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its
available remedies for resolving the claim for indemnification.

9.5. Third-Party Claims.

(a) If a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE IX is based on, or
results from, a claim by a third party for which an Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third-Party Claim, which (i) in the case of a claim for indemnification by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be delivered to the Equityholders
Representatives and (ii) in the case of a claim for indemnification by the
Equityholders Representative shall be delivered to Parent, describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if
known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. Any failure or delay in providing such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of notice from
the Indemnified Party of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so
long as: (i) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in such notice that any
Losses that the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third-Party Claim constitute
Losses that are indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party under this Article IX;
(ii) the Third-Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief; (iii) an adverse judgment or settlement
would not or would not reasonably be likely to establish a precedent adverse
to the business of the Indemnified Party; (iv) the Indemnifying Party conducts
the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently; and (v) the
Indemnifying Party agrees to keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all
developments relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim
and is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with
Section 9.5(b): (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party;
provided that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified





Party, there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party (other than simply arising from the indemnification
obligation hereunder), the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense; (ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party; (iii)
the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent
(provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not provide its consent to a
settlement, compromise or discharge agreed to or recommended by the
Indemnified Party, then the monetary indemnification limitations set forth in
Section 9.3(d) shall not apply to any Losses resulting from such Third-Party
Claim, and the amount of any difference between any such Losses and the
proposed settlement amount shall not be considered in determining whether the
monetary limitations set forth in Section 9.3(d) have been exceeded; and (iv)
the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with
respect to a settlement, compromise or discharge agreed to or recommended by
the Indemnifying Party that consists solely of the payment of a monetary
amount of $4,500,000 or greater (provided that if the Indemnified Party does
not provide its consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge that is
agreed to or recommended by the Indemnifying Party and that consists solely of
the payment of a monetary amount, then the Indemnified Party shall be
responsible for, and the Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnification
obligations with respect to, all Losses resulting from such Third-Party Claim
that are in excess of such monetary amount).

(d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 9.5(b) is or becomes
unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may defend against (with the Indemnifying
Party responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party) in connection with such defense, and consent to the entry
of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third-
Party Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any
consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith).

9.6. Purchase Price Adjustment. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholders Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) agree to treat
each indemnification payment pursuant to this ARTICLE IX as an adjustment to
the consideration being paid to the Equityholders for all Tax purposes and
shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable
Tax Law.

9.7. Fraud and Willful Misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
ARTICLE IX shall limit any Indemnified Party's right to bring an action in a
court of law or equity alleging fraud or willful misconduct in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby that are otherwise available to such
Indemnified Party and to recover Losses from any other Party hereto awarded by
such court with respect thereto and the survival expiration periods





set forth in Section 9.1 and the limitations set forth in Section 9.3 shall
not apply with respect to any such action.

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS



10.1. Tax Indemnity.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified as provided in
Section 9.3(a) from and against, without duplication, any loss, claim,
liability, expense or other damage attributable to (a) all Taxes (or the
nonpayment thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, (b) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or
regulation, and (c) any and all Taxes of any person imposed on the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant
to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing: provided, however, that no such indemnification
shall be available for (1) any Tax to the extent such Tax relates to any Post-
Closing Tax Period; (2) any Tax to the extent such Tax is taken into account
in the computation of the Per Share Merger Consideration; or (3) any Tax to
the extent the Tax resulted from any breach by Parent of any covenant or other
agreement in this ARTICLE X.

(b) Parent shall be responsible for and indemnify the Equityholders from and
against all Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Tax Periods.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Equityholders shall be entitled to receive
the benefit (whether realized by refund of Taxes or by credit against Taxes of
Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) attributable to any deductions
allowed to the Surviving Corporation for the Transaction Expenses, plus any
actual interest collected on any such refund or credits attributable to such
deductions, received from the applicable Taxing authority; provided, however,
that the Stockholder Parties shall indemnify and hold harmless (on a several
basis based on their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Share) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for any excess payment made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the Equityholders Representative (for further distribution to
the Equityholders, subject to Section 12.1(b)) with respect to any such
deduction claimed. The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the Equityholders Representative in obtaining
any refunds or credits which the Equityholders are entitled to receive the
benefit of. Such cooperation shall include (i) informing the Equityholders
Representative if and to the extent that Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company becomes aware of the possible availability of any such refund
or credit, (ii) filing claims (including filing carryback claims and claims
for the overpayment of estimated taxes on Internal Revenue Service Form 4466
and equivalent State forms) or amended Tax Returns at the request of the
Equityholders Representative to obtain any such refund or credit and (iii)
paying the amount of such credit or refund over to the Equityholders
Representative (for further payment to the Equityholders in accordance with
their respective Equity Ownership Percentages and the payment instructions set
forth in their





respective Letters of Transmittal) by wire transfer within five (5) Business
Days after the receipt thereof.

10.2. Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, at its sole cost and expense, all income Tax Returns of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that are
filed or due (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) after the
Closing Date. Such income Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods and by KPMG. At
least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, the
Surviving Corporation shall submit a draft of such Tax Return to the
Equityholders Representative for its review and comment. The Surviving
Corporation and the Equityholders Representative shall cooperate in the
preparation and filing of such tax return and the Surviving Corporation shall
give good faith consideration to any comments made by the Equityholders
Representative and shall make all changes (including making or refraining from
making any election) requested by the Equityholders Representative that are
consistent with applicable Law and are necessary to implement the provisions
of Section 2.9 or otherwise maximize the deductions taken in such returns.

(b) For purposes of preparing all Tax Returns, and for purposes of determining
whether to make (or not to make) certain Tax elections, the Stockholder
Parties, the Equityholders Representative and Parent agree to use the
following conventions (and to cause the Company and Parent's other Affiliates
to use the following conventions):

(i) Any tax deductions resulting from the payment or accrual of an amount in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as occurring on the Closing Date and
no Party shall make any election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
applicable Law) to apply the "next day rule" to such deductions.

(ii) Any gains, income, deductions, losses, or other items resulting from
transactions outside of the ordinary course of business and not contemplated
by this Agreement occurring on the Closing Date at the direction of Parent,
but after the Closing, shall be treated as occurring on the day after the
Closing Date and each Party shall utilize the "next day rule" in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. applicable Law) for purposes of reporting such items on
applicable Tax Returns.

(iii) No Party shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
applicable Law) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(iv) To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, to elect to have the Tax
year of the Company end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not
permitted or required in a jurisdiction such that the Company is required to
file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the Parties agree to use the
following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes



 attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date:
(a) in the case of Income Taxes, Taxes imposed on sales or receipts, and Taxes
imposed on payments, the amount attributable to such portion shall be
determined as if the Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such
Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology"; and (b) in the
case of all other Taxes, the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying
the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (a), any item determined
on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation
deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends
on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion as
compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any estimated payments or payments from a
prior tax period that are applied to a Straddle Period shall be applied
entirely to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

(c) Parent, the Company, the Equityholders Representative and the Stockholder
Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
ARTICLE X and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
(including Tax Contests). Such cooperation shall include the retention for the
full period of any statute of limitations and (upon the other Party's request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Company and the
Equityholders agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Equityholders,
any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements relating to Taxes entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, the Company or the Equityholders, as the case may be,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

10.3. Tax Contests.

(a) If any taxing authority issues to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(1) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct another legal proceeding with
respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period or (2) a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any such

ARTICLE XII

GENERAL PROVISIONS



12.1. Equityholders Representative; Power of Attorney.

(a) The Company hereby initially appoints Sphere as the Equityholders
Representative, as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the
Equityholders to take any action (or refrain from taking any action) on behalf
of the Equityholders that is contemplated to be taken by the Equityholders
Representative in that capacity by this Agreement, including to (i) give and
receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf of itself or
any other Indemnified Party) relating to this Agreement or the Promissory
Note, or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or
thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or the Promissory Note
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by the Equityholders individually); (ii) object to any claims
pursuant to Section 9.4 or Section 9.5; (iii) consent or agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims;
(iv) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree
to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party relating to this
Agreement, the Promissory Note or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; (v) amend this Agreement or the Promissory Note to reduce the
principal amount of the Promissory Note as contemplated by this Agreement);
and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Equityholders Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance. Sphere hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act in such
capacity. The Person serving as the Equityholders Representative may be
replaced at any time by the Equityholders who held a majority of the shares of
voting Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. No bond shall be
required of the Equityholders Representative, and the Equityholders
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services.









(b) The Equityholders Representative shall not be liable to any Person for any
act done or omitted hereunder as the Equityholders Representative while acting
in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel
shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Equityholders
Representative shall be reimbursed from the Equityholders Representative
Holdback Amount for any reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the performance of the Equityholders Representative's
duties hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if the Equityholders Representative reasonably believes that payments for
which it is to be reimbursed from the Representative Holdback Amount pursuant
to this Section 12.1(b) or payments in respect of indemnification obligations
set forth in Section 9.2(a) are likely to be made in the future, then the
Equityholders Representative may withhold the estimated amount of such future
payments from any amounts otherwise required to be distributed to the
Equityholders under this Agreement.

(c) Each Stockholder Party agrees that Parent shall be entitled to
unconditionally assume that any action taken or omitted, or any document
executed by, Sphere purporting to act as Equityholders Representative under or
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement has been authorized by the Equityholders to be
taken, omitted to be taken or executed on such Equityholders' behalf so that
such Equityholders will be legally bound thereby, and each Stockholder Party
agrees not to institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding
against Parent alleging that Sphere did not have the authority to act as the
Equityholders Representative on behalf of the Equityholders in connection with
any such action, omission or execution. No modification or revocation of the
power of attorney granted by the Stockholder Parties to Sphere to serve as the
Equityholders Representative shall be effective as against Parent until Parent
has received a document signed by Stockholders holding Common Stock
representing a majority of the voting power of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time effecting said modification or revocation.

(d) The Equityholders Representative may resign at any time by giving thirty
(30) days' written notice to Parent and the Stockholders; provided, however,
that such resignation shall not be effective unless and until a successor
stockholders' representative has been appointed by Stockholders holding Common
Stock representing a majority of the voting power of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time and such successor accepts such position and the
terms hereof.

(e) If the Equityholders Representative is a natural Person and dies or is
otherwise unable to perform his or her obligations under this Agreement or, if
the Equityholders Representative is not a natural Person and becomes bankrupt,
insolvent or ceases to exist, then a successor to the Equityholders
Representative shall be appointed by Stockholders holding Common Stock
representing a majority of the voting power of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

12.2. Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Party
shall bear all fees, costs and expenses (including investment bankers and
financial advisors, attorneys' and accountants' fees, costs and expenses)
incurred by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.







12.3. Public Announcements. No public release or announcement concerning the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party
without the prior written consent of Parent and the Company (for any such
release or announcement prior to the Effective Time) or the Equityholders
Representative (for any such release or announcement after the Effective
Time), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as
such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange or applicable Governmental Entity to which
the relevant Party is subject, in which case the Party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party; provided,
that this Section 12.3 shall not apply to (i) Parent's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on forms 10-Q, 10-K or 8-K, including any
filing that includes this Agreement as an exhibit or (ii) any regularly
scheduled earnings call conducted by Parent.

12.4. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if properly addressed as provided below as

12.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto,
including the Disclosure Letter, the Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

12.6. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

12.7. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be



entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

12.8. Successors and Assigns; Assignment; Parties in Interest. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns (if any). Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, no Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any Person other than a Party any rights, interests,
benefits or other remedies of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement,
except that the indemnification provisions of this Agreement are intended to
benefit the Indemnified Parties, and the provisions of Section 6.4 are
intended to benefit the Covered Persons, and all such intended third-party
beneficiaries shall be entitled to enforce such provisions of this Agreement.

12.9. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties only by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by (a) Parent and the Company if
such instrument is executed prior to the Effective Time or (b) Parent and the
Equityholders Representative if such instrument is executed after the
Effective Time. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement by any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if,
and to the extent, set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such Party. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

12.10. Governing Law; Venue.

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all
respects by, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to conflicts of law or choice of law provisions thereof.

(b) Unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement, any Legal Action
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement shall be brought or otherwise commenced in any state or federal
court located in the State of Delaware. Each Party (i) expressly and
irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each such court, and
each appellate court located in the State of Delaware, in connection with any
such Legal Action, (ii) agrees that each such court shall be deemed to be a
convenient forum and (iii) agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such Legal Action commenced in any such court,
any claim that such Party is not subject personally to the





jurisdiction of such court, that such Legal Action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Legal Action is improper or that
this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such court.

12.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY TRANSACTION
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.11.

12.12. Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

12.13. Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature
page delivered by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall be binding
to the same extent as an original signature page. Any Party that delivers a
signature page by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall deliver an
original counterpart to any other Party that requests such original
counterpart, it being understood and agreed that the failure to deliver any
such original counterpart upon request shall not affect the binding nature of
the signature page delivered by facsimile or electronic image transmission.

[Signature Page Follows] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed and delivered by its duly authorized representative as of the date
first written above.

The Stockholder Parties (as defined in the Merger Agreement) have made certain
representations and warranties, entered into certain covenants and agreed to
provide certain indemnities as set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below). Holder agrees that, in addition to any other remedy that Maker (as
defined below) may have available at law or equity and subject in all cases to
the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, Maker may, subject to the
limitations and procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement and this Note (as
defined below), reduce the amount outstanding under this Note by any Loss (as
defined below) for which the Stockholder Parties are responsible under the
Merger Agreement.



NON-NEGOTIABLE SECURED 
PROMISSORY NOTE

Issue Date: Original Principal Amount:

[ ], 2014 $31,500,000

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, LKQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Maker"), hereby
promises to pay to the order of Sphere Capital, LLC - Series A, a Delaware
limited liability company, in its capacity as the designated representative of
the Equityholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (together with its
successor and assigns in such capacity as permitted by the terms of the Merger
Agreement or applicable Laws, the "Holder"), the principal amount of
$31,500,000, or such lesser principal amount then outstanding, together with
interest thereon calculated in accordance with the provisions of this non-
negotiable secured promissory note (this "Note").

This Note is the Promissory Note referred to in, and originally issued on [ ],
2014 (the "Issue Date") pursuant to, the Merger Agreement. Each capitalized
term used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to
such term in Section 6 hereof or, if not so defined therein, the meaning
ascribed to such term in the Merger Agreement.

1.Interest. Commencing on the Issue Date and continuing until payment of all
amounts due hereunder, interest shall accrue on the then outstanding principal
amount of this Note at the rate (the "Interest Rate") of one percent (1%) per
annum (based on a year of 365 days and computed on the number of days actually
elapsed).

2. Payments on Note.

(a) Scheduled Payment. Subject to Section 2(e) below, the outstanding
principal amount of this Note and unpaid accrued interest thereon shall be due
and payable on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Issue Date or such
earlier date as shall be specified pursuant to Section 5(b) or

as permitted pursuant to applicable Laws (the "Maturity Date"), and Maker
shall 



pay such amounts on such date. Any payment shall be applied first to accrued
interest and then to outstanding principal.

(b) Optional Prepayments. Maker may, at any time or from time to time, without
premium or penalty, prepay all or any portion of the unpaid principal amount
of this Note together with any unpaid interest which has accrued on the
portion of the principal so prepaid. Any payment shall be applied first to
accrued interest and then to outstanding principal.

(c) Time of Payment. If any payment on this Note becomes due on a day that is
not a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next Business Day
and such extension of time will be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.

(d) Right of Setoff. The principal amount of this Note shall be reduced,
retroactive to the Closing Date, by any amounts for which Losses by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Sections
9.2(a) or 10.1 of the Merger Agreement (whether now existing or hereinafter
arising) in accordance with Section 9.4(b) of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the satisfaction or
reduction of any principal or interest hereunder pursuant to Maker's right of
setoff under this Section 2(d) shall not be considered a prepayment for the
purposes hereof.

(e) Payments in Cash. All payments on this Note shall be made in cash (it
being understood that any reduction pursuant to Section 2(d) or the Merger
Agreement in amounts owing under this Note shall not be deemed to be, or
treated as, payments or prepayments for purposes of this Section 2(e)).

(f) Equityholders Representative. The Holder shall (i) disburse any payments
made to it under this Note to the Equityholders in accordance with Section
2.6(e) of the Merger Agreement and (ii) have authority on behalf of the
Equityholders, to contest or settle any Pending Claim, and any agreement
between Maker and the Holder with respect to any Pending Claim shall be
binding on the Equityholders.

(g) Limitation on Repayment and Prepayment. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Note or the Merger Agreement, no
repayment or prepayment of any amount owed under this Note, whether pursuant
to Section 2 or otherwise, shall be made, and no such failure to make such
repayment shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 5(a), in
each case if the principal amount outstanding under this Note after such
repayment or prepayment would be less than the amount that would be required
to satisfy in full the Aggregate Pending Claim Amount.

3. Mortgage(s). The payment and performance in full of each of the obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment in full of the amounts due hereunder by Maker, is secured by all that certain real estate and improvements thereon, erected or to be erected, situate in the Borough of Exeter, County of Luzerne, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and more particularly described in Exhibit "A" attached hereto and made a part hereof.

PROVIDED ALWAYS, and this instrument is upon the express condition that, if
Maker pays to Mortgagee the principal sum mentioned in the Note, the interest
thereon and all other sums payable by Mortgagor to Mortgagee as are secured
hereby, in accordance with the provisions of the Note and this Mortgage, then
this Mortgage and the estate hereby granted shall cease and become void.

Subject to Section 26 of this Mortgage, Mortgagor hereby irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees and becomes surety for the prompt
payment by Maker, as and when due and payable, whether by acceleration or
otherwise of all amounts now or hereafter owing by Maker in respect of the

payment of, or in any other term in respect of, the Note, or any other

guarantor or obligor.

The Mortgaged Property shall secure the following obligations ("Obligations")
of Maker or Mortgagor to Mortgagee:

(a)all amounts at any time owing or payable under the Note as guaranteed by
Mortgagor in this Mortgage;

(b) all covenants, agreements and obligations of Mortgagor under this
Mortgage; and

(c) all future advances made by Mortgagee for taxes, levies, insurance, and
repairs to or maintenance of the Mortgaged Property.

MORTGAGOR REPRESENTS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTS to and with Mortgagee that until
the indebtedness secured hereby is fully repaid:

1.Title. Mortgagor hereby represents and warrants that [except as set forth in
Schedule 1] it has good and marketable title in fee simple (subject to the
Permitted Liens, as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement (as that term
is defined in the Note)) to the Real Estate.

2. Maintenance of Mortgaged Property. Mortgagor shall keep and maintain or cause to be kept and maintained the Improvements in good order and condition and will promptly make or cause to be made, as and when necessary for such purpose, all repairs, renewals and replacements, structural and nonstructural, exterior and interior, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen. Mortgagor shall abstain from and shall not permit the commission of waste in or about the Mortgaged Property.

3. Insurance. Mortgagor shall keep the Mortgaged Property continuously insured against loss or damage by fire or other casualty in an amount not less than the full replacement cost (evidenced by a "Replacement Cost Endorsement") of the Mortgaged Property. The insurance coverage required under this Section shall be insured under policies: (a) in form reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee; (b) endorsed with a standard mortgagee clause in favor of Mortgagee providing not less than thirty days' notice to Mortgagee of any cancellation or change in coverage; and (c) endorsed to name Mortgagee as loss payee. If the insurance, or any part thereof, shall expire, or be withdrawn or not renewed, or become void or unsafe by Mortgagor's breach of any condition thereof, or become void or unsafe by reason of the failure or impairment of the capital of any company in which the insurance may then be carried, Mortgagor shall place new insurance on the Mortgaged Property. In the event that Mortgagor fails or refuses to place such new insurance on the Mortgaged Property on or before the expiration or withdrawal or nonrenewal of the existing coverage, then Mortgagee may obtain such insurance as Mortgagee deems necessary to satisfy the terms and conditions of this Mortgage. In such event, the cost of such insurance plus a reasonable amount to reimburse Mortgagee for its administrative expenses in obtaining such insurance shall be immediately paid to Mortgagee by Mortgagor. In the event that such costs and expenses are not immediately paid to Mortgagee by Mortgagor, then the amount of such costs and expenses shall be added to the outstanding principal balance of the Note, 



 shall accrue interest thereon and shall be secured by this Mortgage. Evidence
of all renewal policies, with premiums paid, shall be delivered to Mortgagee
prior to the expiration of the old policies. In the event of loss greater than
$50,000 Mortgagor will give immediate notice thereof to Mortgagee, and
Mortgagee may make proof of loss if not timely made by Mortgagor.

4. Taxes and Other Charges. Mortgagor shall pay when due and payable and before interest or penalties are due thereon, without any deduction, defalcation or abatement, all taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents and all other charges or claims which may be assessed, levied, or filed at any time against Mortgagor, the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or against the interest of Mortgagee therein, or which by any present or future law may have priority over the indebtedness secured hereby either in lien or in distribution out of the proceeds of any judicial sale; and Mortgagor shall produce to Mortgagee upon request receipts for the payment thereof. If no Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) is then continuing and Mortgagor in good faith and by appropriate legal action shall contest the validity or amount of any such taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents or other charges and shall have established a reserve for the payment thereof in such form and amount as Mortgagee may reasonably require (including any interest and penalties which may be payable in connection therewith), then Mortgagor shall not be required to pay such taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents or other charges or to produce the receipts while the reserve is maintained and so long as the contest operates to prevent collection, is maintained and prosecuted with diligence, and shall not have been terminated or discontinued adversely to Mortgagor.

5. Future Taxes. If hereafter any law or ordinance shall be adopted imposing a tax directly or indirectly on Mortgagee with respect to the Mortgaged Property, the value of Mortgagor's equity therein, or the indebtedness evidenced by the Note and secured by this Mortgage, then Mortgagor agrees to pay the tax whenever it becomes due and payable thereafter, which agreement shall then constitute a part of this Mortgage.

6. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. Mortgagor, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly comply with all requirements of all laws, ordinances, regulations and orders of all Federal, state, municipal and other governmental authorities relating to the Mortgaged Property ("Legal Requirements"), construction thereon and the use and occupancy thereof, including but not limited to all laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.

7. Further Assurances. Mortgagor will, from time to time, make, do execute and acknowledge, as the situation may require from time to time, such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements and other assurances in law as may be required for the purpose of effectuating the intent hereof and for better assuring and confirming to Mortgagee, its successors and assigns, the lien and security interest created by this Mortgage.

8. Declaration of No Set-Off. Within twenty (20) days after being requested to do so by Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall certify to Mortgagee or to any proposed assignee of this Mortgage, in a writing duly acknowledged, the amount of principal, interest and other charges then owing on the Obligations secured by this Mortgage and by prior liens, if any, and whether there are any setoffs or defenses against them.





9. Additional Covenants. Mortgagor covenants and agrees that until the Obligations secured hereunder have been paid in full, Mortgagor shall:

(b) pay all charges for water, sewer, gas, electric and other utility services
provided to the Mortgaged Property promptly as and when due;

(c) permit, and cause any lessee or occupant of the Mortgaged Property to

(d) not commit or suffer waste with respect to the Mortgaged Property;

(e) not remove or demolish any material portion of the Mortgaged Property

Requirements; and

(g) pay, upon demand, all amounts incurred by Mortgagee in connection with any

material violation of any Legal Requirements;

(d) commencement of any litigation affecting the Mortgaged Property; or

(e) discovery, discharge or release of any hazardous materials for which
Mortgagor is or may be responsible under any Legal Requirements.



11. Condemnation; Casualty.

(a) Condemnation.

(i) In the event of any condemnation or taking of any part of the Mortgaged
Property by eminent domain, alteration of the grade of any street, or other
injury to or decrease in the value of the Mortgaged Property by any public or
quasi-public authority or corporation, all proceeds (that is, the award or
agreed compensation for the damages sustained) allocable to Mortgagor shall be
applicable first to payment of the indebtedness secured hereby, subject to the
terms of the Note. No settlement for the damages sustained shall be made by
Mortgagor without Mortgagee's prior written approval. Receipt by Mortgagee of
any proceeds less than the full amount of the then outstanding debt secured
hereby shall not alter or modify Maker's obligation to continue to pay the
installments of principal, interest and other charges specified in the Note.
All the proceeds shall be applied in the order and in the amounts that
Mortgagee, in Mortgagee's sole discretion, may elect, to the payment of
principal, interest or any sums secured by this Mortgage, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Note, or toward payment to Mortgagor, on such
reasonable terms as Mortgagee may specify, to be used for the sole purpose of
altering, restoring or rebuilding any part of the Mortgaged Property which may
have been altered, damaged or destroyed as a result of the taking, alteration
of grade or other injury to the Mortgaged Property. Receipt of such proceeds
by Mortgagee shall not be subject to a prepayment penalty hereunder or under
the Note.

(ii) If prior to the receipt of the proceeds by Mortgagee the Mortgaged
Property shall have been sold by foreclosure of this Mortgage, Mortgagee shall
have the right to receive the proceeds, to the extent of:

(A) any deficiency found to be due to Mortgagee in connection with the
foreclosure sale, with legal interest thereon, and

(B) reasonable counsel fees, costs and disbursements incurred by Mortgagee in
connection with collection of the proceeds and the proceedings to establish
the deficiency.

(iii) If the amount of the initial award of damages for the condemnation is
insufficient to pay in full the indebtedness secured hereby with interest and
other appropriate charges, Mortgagee shall have the right to prosecute to
final determination or settlement an appeal or other appropriate proceedings
in the name of Mortgagee or Mortgagor, for which Mortgagee is hereby appointed
irrevocably as attorney-in fact for Mortgagor (without requiring Mortgagee to
act as such), which appointment, being for security, is irrevocable. In that
event, the expenses of the proceedings, including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses, shall be paid first out of the proceeds and only the excess, if any,
paid to Mortgagee shall be credited against the amounts due under this
Mortgage.

(iv) Nothing herein shall limit the rights otherwise available to Mortgagee,
at law, including the right to intervene as a party to any condemnation
proceeding.



 (b) Casualty. If the Mortgaged Property is damaged by fire or other casualty,
Mortgagor shall promptly repair and restore the same to its condition prior to
the damage. In the event of any fire or other casualty damaging any part of
the Mortgaged Property, all insurance proceeds shall, subject to the terms of
the Note, be applicable first to payment of the indebtedness secured hereby.
No settlement for the damages sustained shall be made by Mortgagor without
Mortgagee's prior written approval. Receipt by Mortgagee of any insurance
proceeds less than the full amount of the then outstanding debt secured hereby
shall not alter or modify Maker's obligation to continue to pay the
installments of principal, interest and other charges specified in the Note.
All the insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order and in the amounts
that Mortgagee, in Mortgagee's sole discretion, may elect, to the payment of
principal (whether or not then due and payable), interest or any sums secured
by this Mortgage, or toward payment to Mortgagor, on such reasonable terms as
Mortgagee may specify, to be used for the sole purpose of altering, restoring
or rebuilding any part of the Mortgaged Property which may have been damaged
or destroyed as a result of the fire or other casualty to the Mortgaged
Property. Receipt of such proceeds by Mortgagee shall not be subject to a
prepayment penalty hereunder or under the Note. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, so long as no Event of Default shall exist
under this Mortgage, the insurance proceeds shall be delivered by Mortgagee to
Mortgagor on such reasonable terms as Mortgagee may specify for the sole
purpose of restoring or rebuilding any part of the Mortgaged Property which
may have been damaged or destroyed as a result of the event of fire or other
casualty.

12. No Transfer. For the purpose of protecting Mortgagee's security, Mortgagor agrees that (a) any sale or other transfer of title to the Mortgaged Property, or (b) any transfer of any stock, partnership, company or other ownership interests in Mortgagor (other than to an Affiliate (as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of Maker), in either case, without Mortgagee's prior written consent, shall result in immediate acceleration of the Obligations.

13. Mortgagee's Rights. In the event that Mortgagor should fail to pay real estate or other taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents, charges and claims, insurance premiums, or fail to make necessary repairs, or permit waste, Mortgagee, at its election, shall have the right to make any payment or expenditure and to take any action which Mortgagor should have made or taken, or which Mortgagee deems advisable to protect the security of this Mortgage or the Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, any rights granted to Mortgagee under the Note, without prejudice to any of Mortgagee's rights or remedies available hereunder or otherwise, at law. In addition, Mortgagor hereby authorizes Mortgagee, and Mortgagee shall have the continuing right (but not the obligation), at its sole option and discretion, to:

(a) do anything which Mortgagor is required but fails to do hereunder, and in
particular Mortgagee may, if Mortgagor fails to do so within ten (10) business
days after receipt by Mortgagor of written notice from Mortgagee, (i) insure
or take any reasonable steps to protect the Mortgaged Property, (ii) pay all
taxes, levies, expenses and costs arising with respect to the Mortgaged
Property, or (iii) pay any premiums payable on any policy of insurance
required to be obtained or maintained hereunder, and add any amounts paid
under this Section 13(a) to the principal amount of the indebtedness secured
by this Mortgage; and







(b) pay any amounts Mortgagee elects to pay or advance hereunder following the
occurrence of an Event of Default on account of insurance, taxes or other
costs, fees or charges arising in connection with the Mortgaged Property,
either directly to the payee of such cost, fee or charge, directly to
Mortgagor, or to such payee(s) and Mortgagor jointly.

All such sums, as well as costs, advanced by Mortgagee pursuant to this
Mortgage shall be due immediately from Mortgagor to Mortgagee, shall be
secured hereby, and shall bear interest at a rate which shall be two and one-
half percent (2.5 %) higher than the then highest effective rate specified in
the Note (the "Default Rate") from the date of payment by Mortgagee until the
date of repayment.

14. Events of Default. Each of the following shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder:

(a) The occurrence of an Event of Default, as that term is defined in the
Note;

(b) Failure to comply with any term, obligation, covenant or condition
contained in this Mortgage. If such failure is curable and if Mortgagor has
not been given notice of a breach of the same provision of this Mortgage
within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured (and no Event of
Default will have occurred) if Mortgagor, after Mortgagee sends written notice
demanding cure of such failure; (i) cures the failure within fifteen (15)
days; or (ii) if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately
initiates steps sufficient to cure the failure and thereafter continues and
completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance
as soon as reasonably practical;

(c) Any warranty, representation or statement made to Mortgagee by Mortgagor
under this Mortgage is false or misleading in any material respect as of the
date hereof; or

(d) Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial
proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of
Mortgagor or by any governmental agency against any of the Mortgaged Property;
provided, however, that this subsection (d) shall not apply in the event of a
good faith dispute by Mortgagor as to the validity or reasonableness of the
claim which is the basis of the foreclosure or forfeiture proceeding, provided
that Mortgagor gives Mortgagee written notice of such claim and furnishes
reserves or a surety bond for the claim satisfactory to Mortgagee.

15. Rights and Remedies On Default. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under this Mortgage and at any time thereafter prior to the cure of such Event of Default, Mortgagee, at its option, may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies, in addition to any other rights or remedies provided by law:

(a) Subject to applicable law, Mortgagee shall have the right at is option
without notice to Mortgagor to declare the Obligations immediately due and
payable. Mortgagee shall have the right to obtain judgment for the Obligations
(including all amounts advanced or to be advanced by Mortgagee under Section
13 above, all costs and expenses of collection and suit, including any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding affecting Mortgagor, and



reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with any of the foregoing)
together with interest on such judgment at the Default Rate until payment in
full is received by Mortgagee and Mortgagee shall have the right to obtain
execution upon the Mortgaged Property on account of such judgment;

(b) Mortgagee shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take
possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, with the power to
protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, to operate the Mortgaged Property
preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect rents, if any, from the
Mortgaged Property and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the
receivership, against the Obligations. The receiver may serve without bond if
permitted by law. Mortgagee's right to the appointment of a receiver shall
exist whether or not the apparent value of the Mortgaged Property exceeds the
Obligations by a substantial amount. Employment by Mortgagee shall not
disqualify a person from serving as a receiver;

(c) Mortgagee may obtain a judicial decree foreclosing Mortgagor's interest in
all or any part of the Mortgaged Property;

(d) Mortgagee may obtain a judgment for any deficiency remaining in the
Obligations due to Mortgagee after application of all amounts received from
the exercise of the rights provided in this section;

(e) If Mortgagor remains in possession of the Mortgaged Property after the
Mortgaged Property is sold as provided above or Mortgagee otherwise becomes
entitled to possession of the Mortgaged Property upon default of Mortgagor,
Mortgagor shall become a tenant at sufferance of Mortgagee or the purchaser of
the Mortgaged Property and shall, at Mortgagee's option, either (i) pay a
reasonable rental for the use of the Mortgaged Property, or (ii) vacate the
Mortgaged Property immediately upon the demand of Mortgagee;

(f) Mortgagee shall have the right to take possession of any portion of the
Mortgaged Property constituting fixtures or other personal property and any
records pertaining thereto. In addition, upon ten (10) calendar days' prior
written notice to Mortgagor (which Mortgagor hereby acknowledges to be
sufficient and commercially reasonable) Mortgagee shall have the right to
sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any of such Mortgaged Property at
any time and from time to time at public or private sale, with or without
advertisement thereof, with the right of Mortgagee or its nominee to become
purchaser at any sale (unless prohibited by statute) free from any equity of
redemption and from all other claims, and after deducting all legal and other
expenses for maintaining or selling such Mortgaged Property, and all
attorneys' fees, legal or other expenses for collection, sale and delivery,
apply the remaining proceeds of any sale to pay (or hold as a reserve against)
the Obligations and exercise all other rights and remedies of a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code or any other applicable law; and

(g) Mortgagee shall have all other rights and remedies provided in this
Mortgage or available at law.

16. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.





(a) The rights and remedies of Mortgagee as provided in this Mortgage and the
Note shall be cumulative and concurrent; may be pursued separately,
successively or together against Mortgagor, Maker or against the Mortgaged
Property, or both, at the sole discretion of Mortgagee, and may be exercised
as often as occasion therefor shall arise. The failure to exercise any such
right or remedy shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release thereof.

(b) Any failure by Mortgagee to insist upon strict performance by Mortgagor of
any of the terms and provisions of this Mortgage shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this Mortgage and Mortgagee shall
have the right thereafter to insist upon strict performance by Mortgagor of
any and all of them.

(c) Neither Mortgagor nor any other person now or hereafter obligated for
payment of all or any part of the sums now or hereafter secured by this
Mortgage shall be relieved of such obligation by reason of the failure of
Mortgagee to comply with any request of Mortgagor or of any other person so
obligated to take action to foreclose on this Mortgage or otherwise enforce
any provisions of this Mortgage, or by reason of the release, regardless of
consideration, of all or any part of the security held for the indebtedness
secured by this Mortgage, or by reason of any agreement or stipulation between
any subsequent owner of the Mortgaged Property and Mortgagee extending the
time of payment or modifying the terms of this Mortgage without first having
obtained the consent of Mortgagor or such other person; and in the latter
event Mortgagor and all such other persons shall continue to be liable to make
payments according to the terms of any such extension or modification
agreement, unless expressly released and discharged in writing by Mortgagee.

(d) Mortgagee may release, regardless of consideration, any part of the
security held for the indebtedness secured by this Mortgage without, as to the
remainder of the security, in any way impairing or affecting the lien of this
Mortgage or its priority over any subordinate lien.

17. Assignment of Leases. This Mortgage is also an absolute and unconditional assignment to Mortgagee of all Leases and Income, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, for the purpose of vesting in Mortgagee a first priority, perfected security interest in the Leases and the Income. Mortgagor hereby assigns, transfers and sets over to Mortgagee all Leases, all Income and all rights of Mortgagor to enforce the Leases and collect the Income. This assignment includes any award received or receivable by Mortgagor in any legal proceeding involving any tenant under a Lease whether under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise. Mortgagor shall notify any person which Mortgagee may from time to time specify that the Income should be paid directly to Mortgagee and that any modification of the Leases must be approved by Mortgagee. So long as no Event of Default is then continuing, Mortgagor shall have a license, revocable at the will of Mortgagee, to enforce the Leases and collect the Income. Mortgagor hereby authorizes and directs that all other parties now or hereafter owing or paying Income under any Lease or now or hereafter having in their possession or control any Income from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, shall, upon the request of Mortgagee and until Mortgagee directs otherwise, pay and deliver such Income directly to Mortgagee at Mortgagee's address set forth below, or in such other manner as Mortgagee may direct such parties in writing and this authorization shall continue until this Mortgage is released 





of record. No payor making payments to Mortgagee at its request under the
assignment contained in this Mortgage shall have any responsibility to see to
the application of any of such funds, and any party paying or delivering
Income to Mortgagee under such assignment shall be released thereby from any
and all liability to Mortgagor to the full extent and amount of all such
Income so delivered. Notwithstanding any legal presumption to the contrary,
Mortgagee shall not be obligated by reason of its acceptance of this
assignment to perform any obligation of Mortgagor as lessor under any Lease.
Neither the acceptance of this assignment nor the collection of Income under
the Leases shall constitute a waiver of any rights of Mortgagee hereunder or
under the Note or constitute a cure of any default by Mortgagor hereunder or
thereunder.

18. Mortgagor's Waivers. Mortgagor hereby waives and releases all benefit that might accrue to Mortgagor by virtue of any present or future law exempting the Mortgaged Property, or any part of the proceeds arising from any sale thereof, from attachment, levy or sale on execution, or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process or extension of time for payment.

19. Communications. All notices and other communications provided for in this Mortgage shall be in writing and shall be given in the manner and become effective as set forth in the Note, and addressed to the respective parties at their addresses specified below or as to either party hereto at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party hereto.

21. Amendment. This Mortgage cannot be changed or amended except by agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change is sought.

If any term or provision of this Mortgage or the application thereof to any person, property or circumstance shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Mortgage, or the application of such term or provision to persons, properties and circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Mortgage shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

25. Captions. The captions preceding the text of the paragraphs or subparagraphs of this Mortgage are inserted only for convenience of reference and shall not constitute a part of this Mortgage, nor shall they in any way affect its meaning, construction or effect.
