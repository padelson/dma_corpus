dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. </FONT></P>
