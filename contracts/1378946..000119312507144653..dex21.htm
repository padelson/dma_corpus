vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 26, 2007 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Chittenden Corporation, a Vermont corporation ( the "
_Company_ "), and Peoples United Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement in which the Company will, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into
Parent (the " _Merger_ "), so that Parent is the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "); and

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Vermont Business
Corporation Act (the " _VBCA_ ") at the Effective Time, the Company shall
merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall cease.

 

(b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the combination
(including by providing for the merger of the Company and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent) if and to the extent requested by Parent and
consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
amount or kind or timing of the Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect
to the Companys shareholders, (iii) materially impede or delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by  



 

1  this Agreement, or (iv) in the reasonable judgment of the Companys counsel,
require submission to or approval of the Companys shareholders after the
plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been approved by the Companys
shareholders.

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date and
in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Vermont on the Closing Date. The
term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and in Section 11.06 of
the VBCA.

1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger. 

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company or Parent (other than
shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts and
the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that
are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account
Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly
or indirectly, by the Company or Parent in respect of a debt previously
contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to Sections 1.4(e), 1.4(f), 1.5 and 2.3(f), each share of Company
Common Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company
or Parent (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares),
shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.1, into the right to receive the
following, without interest:

(i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked
pursuant to Article II (a " _Cash Election_ "), the right to receive in cash
from Parent an amount (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") equal to the Per Share
Amount (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ ");

(ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive Parent Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to Article II (a " _Stock Election_ "), the right to
receive from Parent the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock
Consideration_ ") as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "); and



 

2 (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked
or deemed revoked pursuant to Article II (collectively, the " _Non-Election
Shares_ "), the right to receive from Parent such Stock Consideration and/or
Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 1.5(b).

" _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest one ten
thousandth, of (A) the Per Share Amount divided by (B) the Parent Closing
Price.

" _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean the sum, rounded to the nearest one-tenth
of a cent, of (A) $20.35 plus (B) the product, rounded to the nearest one-
tenth of a cent, of 0.8775(the " _Share Ratio_ " ) times the Parent Closing
Price. 

" _Parent Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest one-
tenth of a cent, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the
NASDAQ (the " _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.

" _Cash Component_ " shall mean (i) $1,013,022,898 less (ii) if the Pending
Acquisition Agreement is terminated, $67,675,757. The Cash Component shall be
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.4(f).

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_."

(d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in
lieu of fractional shares, into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section
1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c). 

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Share Ratio.

(f) If either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.2(c) or the tax
opinion referred to in Section 7.3(c) cannot be rendered (as reasonably
determined, in each case, by the counsel charged with giving such opinion) as
a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy the "continuity of
interest" requirements under applicable federal income Tax principles relating
to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then Parent shall reduce
the Cash Component to the minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax
opinions to be rendered.



 

3 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares
of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time and that are held by a shareholder who has properly exercised such
shareholders dissenters rights (any such shares being referred to herein as
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") under Chapter 13 of the VBCA shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(c)
and instead shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are
granted by Chapter 13 of the VBCA (unless and until such shareholder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such
shareholders right to dissent from the Merger under the VBCA) and to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the VBCA. If
any such shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right prior to the Election Deadline, each of
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to be
Non-Election Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, unless such
shareholder shall thereafter otherwise make a timely Election under this
Agreement. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect
or has effectively withdrawn or lost such shareholders right to dissent from
the Merger after the Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time, (x) the right to receive the
Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion to the extent permitted by
applicable law; or (y), if not so permitted by applicable law or if Parent
shall not have made any such determination, the right to receive the
consideration received with respect to Non-Election Shares. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or
payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demand or notices, including the right to determine
the estimate of fair value under Section 13.25 of the VBCA and to determine
whether to withhold payment to the extent permitted by Section 13.27 of the
VBCA. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise
negotiate any such demands.

1.5  _Proration_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Shares) to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (which
for this purpose shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined
as of the Effective Time) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Component by (y) the Per
Share Amount. All other shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
Stock Consideration (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled as provided in Section 1.4(b)).

(b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business
days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent (as
defined herein) to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock
of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration
as follows:

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be
deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time)
(the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all
Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion
Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions
of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining
number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; and



 

4 (ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions
of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration; or

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and the Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number
exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of
which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Stock
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration.



 

5 1.6 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted to employees or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan or Directors
Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) (collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") shall be canceled, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, or as
soon as practicable thereafter, from the Surviving Corporation, in
consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any
required withholding taxes.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each performance share award granted to any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Companys
Performance Share Program that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive at the Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Amount, multiplied by (B)
the greater of (i) 100% of the Target Performance Shares (as defined in such
Performance Share Program) relating to Performance Cycles (as defined in such
Performance Share Program) in effect as of the Effective Time plus
accumulated dividends, if any, on such shares as determined in accordance with
such Performance Share Program and (ii) 100% of the Performance Shares (as
defined in such Performance Share Program) relating to Performance Cycles in
effect as of the Effective Time based on performance calculated through the
quarter ending immediately prior to the Effective Time plus accumulated
dividends, if any, on such shares as determined in accordance with such
Performance Share Program, subject to such deducting and withholding as may be
required under the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect
to such payment.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restricted stock awards
granted under the Company Stock Plans shall vest in full so as to no longer
be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements, and all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of the right to
receive the Forms of Election and to make elections and receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto.

1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation of Parent_. At the Effective Time, the
Parent Certificate (as defined in Section 4.1) shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.

1.8 _By-laws of Parent_. At the Effective Time, the Parent By-laws (as defined
in Section 4.1) shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



 

6 1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

1.10 _Bank Mergers_.

(a) Simultaneously with the Merger, each of Chittenden Trust Company, The Bank
of Western Massachusetts, Flagship Bank and Trust Company, Maine Bank and
Trust, Ocean National Bank, and Merrill Merchants Bank (collectively, the "
_Company Subsidiary Banks_ ") shall be merged with and into separate to-be-
formed federally chartered savings bank subsidiaries (each a " _Parent Bank
Subsidiary_ ") of Peoples United Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and
a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "). Such mergers are
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Bank Mergers_ ". Each Parent Bank
Subsidiary shall be the surviving entity in its respective Bank Merger and
shall continue its corporate existence and, following such Bank Merger,
the corporate existence of the applicable Company Bank Subsidiary shall
cease.

(b) Each of the Bank Mergers shall be implemented pursuant to a subsidiary
plan of merger, in a form to be specified by Parent and approved by the
Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (a "
_Subsidiary Plan of Merger_ "). In order to obtain the necessary state and
federal regulatory approvals for the Bank Mergers, the parties hereto shall
cause the following to be accomplished prior to the filing of applications for
regulatory approval: (i) the Company shall cause each Company Subsidiary Bank
to approve a Subsidiary Plan of Merger, the Company, as the sole shareholder
of each Company Subsidiary Bank shall approve each Subsidiary Plan of Merger,
and the Company shall cause each Subsidiary Plan of Merger to be duly executed
by each Company Subsidiary Bank and delivered to Parent and (ii) following
the formation of the Parent Bank Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause each Parent
Bank Subsidiary to approve a Subsidiary Plan of Merger, Parent shall cause
Parent Bank, as the sole shareholder of each Parent Bank Subsidiary, to
approve a Subsidiary Plan of Merger for each Parent Bank Subsidiary, and
Parent shall cause each Parent Bank Subsidiary to duly execute and deliver a
Subsidiary Plan of Merger. Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
cause each Company Subsidiary Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank to
cause each Parent Bank Subsidiary, to execute such certificate of merger and
articles of combination and such other documents and certificates as are
necessary to make the Bank Mergers effective, subject to the closing
conditions set forth in Article VII, and Parent shall cause such documents to
be timely and appropriately filed and endorsed, where required, by the Office
of Thrift Supervision (" _OTS_ ") and other federal and state authorities so
that the Bank Mergers shall become effective simultaneously with the Effective
Time.

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock (" _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the
following procedures:

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.1 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which
such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.



 

7 (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Form of Election_ ") which shall be mailed to record holders of Company
Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an
Election prior to the Election Deadline.

(c) Parent shall cause the Form of Election to be sent to holders of record
not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as
possible a Form of Election to any shareholder of the Company who requests
such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election
and prior to the Election Deadline.

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Person authorized
to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which
Person shall be selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to
Company shareholders, shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates to
which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee
of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from
a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank
or trust company in the United States; _provided_ that such Certificates are
in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee
of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise
determined by Parent, in its sole discretion. For shares of Company Common
Stock held in book entry form, Parent shall establish procedures for delivery
of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. In the event that a shareholder of the Company has provided a notice
of intent to demand payment (a " _Notice of Dissenter s Intent_") pursuant
to Section 13.21 of the VBCA, any Election submitted by such shareholder
prior to submission of such Notice of Dissenters Intent shall be deemed
withdrawn, and any Election submitted by such shareholder after submission of
such Notice of Dissenters Intent (unless such Notice of Dissenters Intent
shall have theretofore been withdrawn) shall be deemed invalid.

(e) As used herein, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, " _Election
Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal
office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (1) the date of the
meeting of the Company shareholders pursuant to Section 6.3 and (2) the date
that Parent and the Company shall agree is as near as practicable to five (5)
business days prior to the expected Closing Date. Parent shall issue a press
release informing the Companys shareholders of the Election Deadline as
promptly as practicable following the determination thereof.

(f) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline,
change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to  



 

8  the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised
Form of Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement,
if Parent shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is
not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (neither
Parent nor the Company nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify
any shareholder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not
in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a
proper Election is thereafter timely made. 

(g) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline,
revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline
of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections
shall be automatically deemed revoked, and all Certificates shall be promptly
returned to the Companys shareholders, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
written notification from Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article VIII or that this Agreement has been
amended by the parties to so provide in connection with a new election period.

(h) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
(i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Company
shareholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner and
extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations prescribed by Section 1.5, (iii) the issuance and delivery of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted in the Merger and (iv) the method of payment of cash for shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
(i) shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock
Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate
Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.3(f)) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.

2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event within ten (10) business days, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not properly complete
and submit an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s)
shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s)  



 

9  (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s))) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form
and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent
Agreement and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
in accordance with Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of such Certificate and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3(c). 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s), accompanied by
a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed
elected by it, subject to, and in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5)
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only
the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to, this Article II.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and
until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid
and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined
herein) required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent
(or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time if Parent has
requested that the Exchange Agent pay to Parent the unclaimed portion of the
Exchange Fund, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise  



 

10  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock
such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in accordance with Section 1.5 and the procedures set forth in this
Article II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Closing
Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded
to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.4.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent upon the request of Parent. Any former shareholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.



 

11 ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Section 9.2 and except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by the Company to Parent

Article III, or to one or more of the Companys covenants, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule
shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to
another section of this Agreement, and _provided further_ that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no item is
required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a representation
or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by

ordinary course of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no
Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has pending any proceeding
or enforcement action or, to the knowledge of the Company, has since January
1, 2004 initiated any proceeding, enforcement action or investigation into the
business, disclosures or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Since January 1, 2004, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has

Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2004 by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement. To the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, there has not been any event
or occurrence since January 1, 2004 that would result in a determination that

date of this Agreement (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), and (ii) each
communication mailed by the Company to its shareholders, in each case
since January 1, 2004 and prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither any
Company SEC Report nor any such communication to the Companys shareholders,

statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall
be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects

of internal control over financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of
the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (y) has implemented

others within those entities, and (z) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. These disclosures (if any) were made in writing by management to
the Companys auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Parent. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company,

no fact or condition exists which is reasonably likely to cause a Material
Adverse Effect in the future. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material

will have complied in all material respects, with all laws and regulations
relating to such Loans.

(c) None of the agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of its

(b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than
those of general application that apply to similarly situated savings and loan
holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such
returns being accurate and complete in all material respects), has paid all
Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made provision for the
payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed
to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities other
than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith,
have not been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against.
There are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or
assessments upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for which Parent does not
have reserves that are adequate under GAAP. 



 

42 4.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

(a) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary hold all material licenses, franchises,

or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the USA Patriot
Act. 

(b) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has properly administered all accounts
for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or

of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of Parent, any

committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such
fiduciary account and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are

applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ. Section 4.11(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of

is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all
Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as
currently conducted. The use of any Intellectual Property by Parent and each
Parent Subsidiary does not, to the knowledge of Parent, infringe on or
otherwise violate the rights of any Person and is in accordance with any
applicable license pursuant to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary acquired
the right to use any Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of Parent, no
Person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by and/or licensed to Parent or its Subsidiaries. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any written notice of any
pending claim with respect to any Intellectual Property used by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary and no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by

would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. 

4.13 _Reorganization; Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent (a)
is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b) knows of no reason why all regulatory
approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a timely
basis.



 

43 4.14 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or in any other document filed with
any other Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading. The portions of the Proxy Statement relating to Parent
and other portions within the reasonable control of Parent will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Form S-4 will comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

4.15 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Section 4.15 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete
and correct list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting,
bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option or other
equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-
sharing, fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or
commitment for the benefit of any employee or director of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, entered into, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary (such plans, programs, agreements and commitments, herein referred
to as the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ").

(b) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has operated and administered each
Parent Benefit Plan in compliance with all applicable laws and the terms of
each such plan. The terms of each Parent Benefit Plan are in compliance with
all applicable laws.

(c) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, has been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section
409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable
interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the Code and (B)(1) the proposed
regulations issued thereunder or (2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1.
To the extent required, the documentation for each Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan has been amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code
and the final regulations issued thereunder.

(d) All stock options granted by Parent have been granted in compliance with
the terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plan and applicable laws. The per
share exercise price or purchase price for each such stock option of Parent is
equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying shares of
Parent Common Stock determined as prescribed by the relevant Parent Benefit
Plan on the effective date of the corporate action effectuating the grant of
such stock option.

4.16 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action or written notices
with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters or any private
or governmental environmental, health or safety investigations or remediation
activities of any nature seeking to impose, or, to the knowledge of Parent,
that are reasonably expected to result in, any liability to or obligation on
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal environmental, health or safety  



 

44  statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (collectively, "
_Environmental Matters_ "), pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. To the knowledge of Parent, there are
no circumstances that are reasonably expected to give rise to any
such Environmental Matters. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to any of the foregoing.

4.17 _CRA, Anti-money Laundering_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is
a party to any agreement with any individual or group regarding Community
Reinvestment Act matters and Parent has no knowledge of any facts or
circumstances, which would cause Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to be deemed
not to be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for
Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state regulators of lower
than "satisfactory". The Board of Directors of Parent has adopted and Parent
has implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and
appropriate customer identification verification procedures that has not been
deemed ineffective by any Governmental Authority and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA Patriot Act and the
regulations thereunder.

4.18 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent has, and will have at the Effective Time,
sufficient funds on hand to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration and the
consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Options and Company Shares
in accordance with Section 1.6, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

4.19 _Related Person_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is,
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, a "Related Person" as
defined in Article VIII of the Company Certificate.

4.20 _Definition of Parent s Knowledge_. As used in this Agreement, the
phrase "to the knowledge of Parent" or any similar phrase means the actual
(and not constructive or imputed) knowledge of those individuals identified in
Section 4.20 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
 



 

49  Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Parent (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, promptly furnish to
the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably

shall cause each of its  



 

50  Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives of the other party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and,
during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such
party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may reasonably request (in the case of a request by the Company,
information concerning Parent that is reasonably related to the prospective
value of Parent Common Stock or to Parents ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby). Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
its Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,

agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. To the extent
practicable, the parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

permissible under the Pending Acquisition Agreement or related confidentiality
agreement, shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide access to Parent

to the Pending Acquisition Counterparty and to the extent not permissible, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such permission. The Company shall
not be required to provide access to or to disclose information with respect
to the Pending Acquisition Counterparty where such access or disclosure would
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. To the
extent practicable, the parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(c) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties as of May 11, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this
Agreement.

6.3 _Shareholder Approval_. 

(a) The Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder
approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the
_"Company Shareholder Approval_ "), and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Subject to
Sections 6.3(c) and 6.11, the Board of Directors of the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the requisite
shareholder vote in favor of the approval of the plan of merger reflected
in this Agreement required to consummate the Merger. The Company agrees that
unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, it  



 

51  has an unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders
at its shareholder meeting even if there is a Change in the Company
Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.3(b)).

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a resolution
recommending, and subject to Section 6.3(c), the Board of Directors will
recommend, that the Companys shareholders approve the plan of merger
reflected in this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.3(c), neither the Company
nor the Board of Directors of the Company (nor any committee thereof) shall,
in a manner adverse to Parent, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by such Board of Directors of
the plan of merger reflected in this Agreement to the Companys shareholders
(it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with
respect to a Company Alternative Proposal (as defined in Section 6.11(a))
shall be considered an adverse modification of such recommendation), (ii)
take any action or make any statement in connection with the meeting of the
Company shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such
approval, or (iii) recommend any Company Alternative Proposal (as defined in
Section 6.11) (any action referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being a "
_Change in the Company Recommendation_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(b), prior to the date of the meeting of
Company shareholders pursuant to this Section 6.3, the Board of Directors of
the Company may approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.11(a)) and effect a Change in the
Company Recommendation in connection therewith, and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(g), after the fifth (5th) business day following
Parents receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has decided
that a bona fide unsolicited written Company Alternative Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of Section 6.11) constitutes a
Superior Proposal (it being understood that the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal (and a new five (5) business day
period shall commence) in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such
third party or its affiliates that the Company proposes to accept) if, but
only if, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined
in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law, (ii)
during the five (5) business day period after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by Parent, the Company and the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Parent to
make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Company
Recommendation without effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have any obligation to propose
any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and (iii) at the end of such five (5) business day period,
after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may
have been proposed by Parent since its receipt of such Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company has again in good faith made
the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.3(c) and (B) that such
Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, making of a Change in the Company Recommendation by the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not change the approval of the Board
of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. 



 

52 6.4 _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other Person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company to deliver to
Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to
the date of the meeting of Company shareholders to be held pursuant to
Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit A.

6.5 _NASDAQ Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For the period immediately following the Effective Time through December
31, 2009, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide
to those individuals actively employed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits (other than equity-related
benefits), rates of base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities
that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of
base salary or hourly wage provided to such Covered Employees and the
aggregate employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities provided to such
Covered Employees under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the
right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Covered Employee at any time or require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or
annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination. In
particular, Parent agrees to provide, or to cause the Parent Subsidiaries to
provide, through at least December 31, 2009, a contribution for
Covered Employees under the Chittenden Corporation Incentive Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan (the "Savings Plan") or comparable 401(k) plan maintained
by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary, at a level which is not less than the level
of "core contribution" provided for under the Savings Plan immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in
an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of
such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under such employee benefit
plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a participant immediately
prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan,
to the same extent such service was recognized under the Company 401(k)
plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that such
recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits payable to
the Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, and (ii) with
respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any
Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year that includes the
year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to participate, (x) cause any
pre-existing condition  



 

53  limitations under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect
to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived
or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
medical or other health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year
that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or
vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) The parties do not intend for this Agreement to amend any Company Benefit
Plans or the terms of any sub-agreements or sub-plans, terms and conditions,
restrictive covenants or participation requirements thereof, except and to the
extent such amendment is explicitly contemplated by the express language of
this Agreement.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and their successors to honor
and continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all
benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries existing as of the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, all employment, severance,
deferred compensation or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case only to the
extent such benefit obligations, contractual rights, agreements, plans and
policies are listed in Section 6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a
"change-in-control" for purposes of any employee benefit plans, agreements
and arrangements of the Company. Parent shall, or shall cause a Parent
Subsidiary to, pay on the Closing Date (or such later date as may be required
for such payments to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the guidance issued in connection therewith) all cash amounts due under any
severance, "change-in-control" or similar or comparable agreement entered into
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any individual so identified in
Section 6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Thereafter, Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries shall continue to be obligated to honor the remaining
provisions of any such agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to
limit the rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate
any such agreement, plan or policy in accordance with its terms.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries shall have any
obligation to continue the employment of any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and nothing contained herein shall give any such employee
the right to continued employment with Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a
period of two years following the Effective Time, any employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary whose employment terminates due to a job elimination
on or after the Effective Time and who leaves employment in good standing
shall be given consideration by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries when
applying for re-employment in a position comparable to his or her
previous position with the Company or a Company Subsidiary. Such
consideration will be preferential to the extent warranted by previous
performance, skill set and employment history, and provided that such
preferential consideration is consistent with the obligations of Parent or
the relevant Parent Subsidiary under any applicable laws or regulations.

(f) Certain employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries designated
in writing by the Company (other than employees entitled to receive amounts
under severance or  



 

54  "change-in-control" agreements) shall be entitled to receive a "retention"
bonus from the Company, a Company Subsidiary, Parent or a Parent Subsidiary,
in the event such employee remains an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, until the
Effective Time (or in certain cases, through a post-closing transition
period, including systems conversion, if applicable); _provided_ that such
employee satisfactorily fulfills the duties and responsibilities of the
position of such employee through the Effective Time or thereafter, if
applicable. The maximum aggregate amount of such retention bonuses and the
categories of employees eligible to receive such bonuses are set forth in
Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(g) Parent consents to cash bonus payments by the Company to the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for calendar year 2007, regardless of
the timing of the Closing Date, pursuant to the Companys bonus plans as
described in Section 6.6(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and consistent
with the Companys past practice (except with the respect to the timing of the
payment thereof) in an aggregate amount not to exceed the maximum dollar
amount set forth in Section 6.6(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(h) To the extent that any payment or benefit becomes payable to an
individual who is considered a "specified employee" of the Company within the
meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or as a result of such
individuals cessation of service to the Company or a Company Subsidiary, the
payment of which is to be delayed to avoid the imposition of interest,
penalties and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409(a) of the Code
(a " _409A Deferred Payment_ "), such 409A Deferred Payment shall earn
interest calculated at the short-term applicable federal rate until the time
that the payment is actually made. On or before the Effective Time, the
Company shall make an irrevocable contribution to a rabbi trust with an
independent bank trustee in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
409A Deferred Payments plus interest.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "),
including any such Claim in which any present or former director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective heirs or representatives
or any such person who served at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as a director or officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director or officer, or acting in any such capacity, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) the preparation,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. In furtherance
of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law and regardless of whether the
Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless, the Indemnified
Parties against all costs and expenses  



 

55  (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any
Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as directors,
officers, trustees, partners, employees, fiduciaries or agents (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event of any such Claim, (i) the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by any Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
promptly after statements therefor are received (unless the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall elect to defend such
action), and (ii) the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_
, that none of the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or
articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section
6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger for a minimum
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time ( _provided_ that any claim
asserted prior to the expiration of such period and all rights to
indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the disposition
of such claim), and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for such period, and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request
of Parent pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof, it being understood that nothing in
this sentence shall require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not
less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially
less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than, the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so
long as the aggregate cost of such policy endorsement is less than $750,000
(the " _Insurance Amount_ "); _provided_ that the Company agrees to cooperate
in good faith with Parent in order to obtain the lowest premium for such
coverage. In the event that the Insurance Amount is insufficient for such
coverage, the Company may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser
coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.7.



 

56 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent agree to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement,
the Merger.

(b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parents sole expense, take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise
the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided further_ that a failure to comply
with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the
failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the
underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.
The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any change or event having a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Pending
Acquisition Agreement) or which it believes would, or would be reasonably
likely to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the Pending Acquisition
Agreement or cause a condition to closing set forth in the Pending
Acquisition Agreement to not be satisfied.

6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may
be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company
Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock or any acquisition of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.11 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee,
agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall directly or  



 

57  indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate (including
by way of furnishing nonpublic information) or take any other action designed
to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including,
without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would
constitute a Company Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries
or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose any of the
foregoing, being referred to herein as a " _Company Alternative Proposal_ "),
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Company
Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Company Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Company
shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance
with the other terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into an
agreement with the Person proposing such Company Alternative Proposal on terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company than (except
that the standstill provisions of such agreement may permit a Person
proposing to make such Company Alternative Proposal to make a Company
Alternative Proposal, and to communicate any revision or modification of the
Company Alternative Proposal, to the Company or its Board of Directors), those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement prior to furnishing or affording
access to any nonpublic information or data with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to a Company Alternative Proposal,
and providing Parent with a copy of such agreement, to consider and
participate in discussions with respect to a bona fide Company Alternative
Proposal received by the Company, if and only to the extent that (i) the Board
of Directors of the Company first reasonably determines in good faith (A)
such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, and
(ii) the Company has provided Parent with at least two (2) business days
prior notice of such determination. The Company shall promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information (whether written or oral) regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not
previously provided to Parent, such additional information to be provided no
later than the date of provision of such information to such other party.

As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Transaction_ " means any of
(i) a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) (other
than Parent or its affiliates) directly or indirectly acquires or would
acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class
of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with
respect to a merger of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group
of Persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire
control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of the Company and securities of the entity
surviving any merger or business combination including any of the Companys
Subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more
than 15% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net
income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;  



 

58   _provided_ that, for the purposes of Section 8.4(a) (i), (ii) and (iii)
hereof, the reference to "15%" in this definition shall be deemed to be a
reference to "a majority" and the definition of "Company Alternative Proposal"
shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Company Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the shareholders of the
Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to
receive all required governmental approvals and otherwise reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Company Alternative
Transaction shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.11(a),
except that the reference to "15%" in the definition of "Company Alternative
Transaction" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and the
definition of "Company Alternative Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to
a transaction involving the Company.

(b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Company Alternative Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Company Alternative Proposal, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company
or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors
of the Company or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, a
Company Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Company
Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making a Company
Alternative Proposal, and the material terms of any such Company Alternative
Proposal or modification or amendment to a Company Alternative Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material
changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms
of any such Company Alternative Proposal, indication or request. The Company
shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent, orally
and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Company Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a). 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than each other) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than the
other party hereto who have been furnished confidential information regarding
itself in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a
Company Alternative Proposal, as the case may be, within the 12 months prior
to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party
from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have
been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make
a Company Alternative Proposal.



 

59 (d) Nothing contained in Section 6.3 or this Section 6.11 shall prohibit the
Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to a
Company Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company
Recommendation unless it is limited to a stop, look and listen communication
or the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure and does not recommend that Company shareholders tender
their shares.

6.12 _Certain Post-Closing Matters_.

(a) _Directorships_. Parent shall take such actions as may be reasonably
required to appoint, effective as of the Effective Time, two of the Companys
independent directors to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation
and, to the extent so required, shall increase the size of the Parent Board of
Directors to permit the appointment of such individuals.

(b) _Maintenance of Separate Parent Bank Subsidiaries._ For a period of at
least one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
each Parent Bank Subsidiary as a separately chartered federal savings bank,
except in the event of a change in law or regulation that, in the reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, would cause such maintenance of
the Parent Bank Subsidiaries as separately chartered federal savings banks
not to be in the best interests of Parent.

(c) _Charitable Giving._ Parent agrees to continue the Companys annual level
of charitable giving in the region currently served by the Company at current
levels for a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective Time.

(d) _Bank Presidents._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees to offer, or
cause the Parent Subsidiaries to offer, employment to the individuals set
forth on Section 6.12(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule substantially in

individual is employed in his current position with a Company Subsidiary Bank
as of the Effective Time.

6.13 _Pending Acquisition_. The Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to complete the Pending Acquisition as soon as practicable and (ii)
terminate the Pending Acquisition Agreement if the Pending Acquisition has not
closed by the later of (A) the termination date set forth in Section 8.1(c) of
the Pending Acquisition Agreement and (B) the date on which the OTS has
issued its approval of the Merger and the Bank Mergers.

6.14 _Trust Preferred Redemption_. The Company shall cause the redemption of
the Trust Preferred Securities no later than July 31, 2007.

material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

(c)  _Federal Tax Opinion_. The Company shall have received the opinion of
its counsel, Goodwin Procter LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, dated the Closing Date, substantially to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing at the
Effective Time, the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may
require and rely upon customary representations contained in certificates of
officers of the Company and Parent.

(d) _Regulatory Approvals_. All regulatory approvals set forth in Section 3.4
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Bank Mergers, shall have been obtained and shall
remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect
thereof shall have expired (all such approvals and the expiration of all such
waiting periods being referred as the " _Company Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ ").



 

62 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument
authorized by the boards of directors of the Company and Parent, as determined
by a vote of a majority of the members of each respective entire board of
directors;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or a Company Requisite
Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or a Bank Merger and
such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
have such order, injunction, or decree lifted; 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result
in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is
not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such
breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

(e) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.11, or (ii) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have (A) failed to recommend in the Proxy Statement the
approval of the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement (such
recommendation, the " _Company Recommendation_ ") or (B) caused to exist a
Change in the Company Recommendation (or, in the case of clause (ii), resolved
to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof;

(f) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Shareholder Approval is
not obtained at the annual or special meeting of Company shareholders called
for the purpose of obtaining such Company Shareholder Approval or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof;



 

63 (g) by the Company, immediately prior to entering into a definitive agreement
to effect a Superior Proposal in accordance with the requirements of Section
6.3(c), _provided_ that the Company shall pay an amount equal to the Fee (as
defined in Section 8.4) concurrently with such termination.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any clause of this
Section 8.1 (other than clause (a)) shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the Company,
Parent, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that (i) Sections 6.2(c), 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 9.4,
9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except (i) as set forth in Section 8.4 and (ii) with
respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and
all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which
shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

8.4 _Termination Fee_.

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $65,000,000 (the " _Fee_ ") if
this Agreement is terminated as follows:

(i) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(c) either (x) without the meeting of Company shareholders pursuant to
Section 6.3 having been convened or (y) with such meeting of Company
shareholders having been convened but the Company Shareholder Approval not
having been obtained and (B) a Company Alternative Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the senior management or the
Board of Directors of the Company after the date hereof, and shall not have
been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the date specified in Section 8.1(c) (or,
in the case of clause (A)(y), prior to the date of such meeting of Company
shareholders), then if any Company Alternative Transaction is consummated, or
a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Alternative Transaction (a
" _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") is entered into, within 12 months after
the date of such termination, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the date
of such consummation or Company Acquisition Agreement execution, whichever
first occurs;

(ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and (B) a Company Alternative Proposal shall have
been  



 

64  publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the senior management or the
Board of Directors of the Company after the date hereof, and shall not have
been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the date of such termination, then if any
Company Alternative Transaction is consummated, or a Company Acquisition
Agreement is entered into, within 12 months after the date of such
termination, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the date of such
consummation or Company Acquisition Agreement execution, whichever first
occurs;

(iii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)
as the result of a breach by the Company of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement other than the covenants and agreements set forth in
Section 6.3 or 6.11 and (B) a Company Alternative Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise communicated after the date hereof to the
senior management or the Board of Directors of the Company, and shall not have
been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the occurrence of such breach, then if
any Company Alternative Transaction is consummated, or a Company Acquisition
Agreement is entered into, within 12 months after the date of such
termination, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the date of such
consummation or Company Acquisition Agreement execution, whichever first
occurs; or

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
then the Company shall pay the Fee within one business day after a demand for
payment following the termination.

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
Section 8.4(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the Fee set forth in this
Section 8.4, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit; _provided_ that, if such suit does not result
in a judgment against the Company for the Fee, then Parent shall pay to the
Company its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In no event shall
an amount greater than the Fee be payable pursuant to this Section 8.4. The
Company acknowledges that it is obligated to pay any amounts due pursuant to
this Section 8.4 whether or not the shareholders of the Company have approved
this Agreement.

8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
Merger by the shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of
such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further
approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed,  



 

65  (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m. on a date and at a place to be specified by the parties, which date
shall be no later than five business days after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "). If the Effective Time of the Merger
would otherwise occur during December 2007, then the Closing Date shall be
postponed until a mutually acceptable date no later than the end of the first
full week of January 2008.

9.2 _Standard_. No representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Article III or of Parent contained in Article IV shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no party hereto shall be
deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for any purpose under
this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence or absence of
any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances or
events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in
Article III, in the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the case of
Parent, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively (disregarding for
purposes of this Section 9.2 any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualification contained in any representations or warranties other
than in Section 3.8(a) and 4.8(a)). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, the representations and warranties contained in (x) Section 3.2(a)
shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct except to a _de
minimis_ extent, (y) Sections 3.2(b), 3.3(a), 3.3(b)(i), 3.7 and 3.26, in the
case of the Company, and Sections 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.3(b)(i), and 4.7, in the case
of Parent, shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in

_Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger_ Exhibit A

Form of Affiliate Letter

Peoples United Financial, Inc.

850 Main St., P.O. Box 1580

Bridgeport, CT 06604

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Chittenden Corporation, a Vermont corporation (the " _Company_
"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been
further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of June 26, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between
Peoples United Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
the Company, the Company shall be merged with and into Parent (the " _Merger_
"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

I represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive any
Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common
Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its
requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant
to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders
of the Company I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Company and
the distribution by me of Parent Common Stock has not been registered under
the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock
issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition
has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion
of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

 

I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer
or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the
Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an
exemption from such registration available. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents
transfer agents with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be
placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with
the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under
said act or an exemption from such registration."

I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Parent Common Stock has
been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the
issuance of a letter to Parents transfer agent removing such stop transfer
instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A)
one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the
Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing
Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if
two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under
the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the
Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or
(C) I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of
the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not
required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory
evidence or representations that the securities represented by such
certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or
pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.

I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I,
my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.



 

72 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of
this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
