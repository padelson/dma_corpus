27, 2008, among Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B><I>Parent</I></B>&#148;), Milano MH

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company intend to effect a merger (the &#147;<B><I>Merger</I></B>&#148;) of
Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;<B><I>DGCL</I></B>&#148;), with the Company to be the surviving corporation of the
Merger, which Merger will be followed, as soon as reasonably practicable, by a merger of the
Surviving Corporation (as defined below) with and into Merger LLC (the &#147;<B><I>Upstream Merger</I></B>&#148;). It is
intended that the Merger be mutually interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Upstream
Merger and that the Upstream Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by <U>Section
5.19</U>, be effected as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (as defined below)
without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the parties hereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the &#147;<B><I>Merger</I></B>&#148;) upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
&#147;<B><I>DGCL</I></B>&#148;) and have approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement.

fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company Shareholders, (ii)&nbsp;approved this
Agreement, the Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding the Upstream Merger) and
(iii)&nbsp;recommended that the Company Shareholders adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the
Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and the
Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction, shall qualify as a
reorganization described in Section&nbsp;368(a)(1)(A) of the Code (as defined below).

Parent&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parker H. Petit, a Company shareholder, is
entering into a Voting Agreement with Parent in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (the &#147;<B><I>Voting
