In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such Merger Consideration,

destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 (h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.7_ , neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation (or any successor thereto), on a daily basis. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payment.

All Shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (and any payments in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_ and _1.7(e)_ ) and the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who did not vote in favor of
the Merger (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), which shareholders comply with all
of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The

appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by

demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Neither the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.6_. 

  

 1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such lawful and necessary action.

 (a) _Section 2.21(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), each employment, consultancy, non-compete, severance, change of control, or similar agreement, Contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other Contract, plan, arrangement or policy providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock purchase, stock option or other stock-related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, fringe benefits, vacation benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits and any summary plan descriptions) which covers any current employee or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or its subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates or any of their dependents, with respect to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any material liability, whether current or contingent (individually, a " _Company Employee Plan_ " and collectively, the " _Company Employee Plans_ "). A copy of each such Company Employee Plan (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto or a description of each Company Employee Plan that is unwritten, has been made available to Parent together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, where applicable, all schedules and actuarial and accountants reports) and Tax Return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. 

   

 (b) No Company Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) No Company Employee Plan is a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), or a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA (a " _MEWA_ ") or a multiple employer plan as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither the Company, any if its subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA); or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States. 

   

 (d) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Company Qualified Plan_ ") is so qualified and the plan as currently in effect has received a favorable determination letter to that effect from the Internal Revenue Service, no such determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and to the Companys knowledge, there is no reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such Company Qualified Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company Employee Plan with such exceptions as would not have or be reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has been operated in good faith compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations, guidance and notices issued thereunder. The Company has complied in all material respects with the reporting and wage withholding requirements under Section 409A of the Code and applicable IRS guidance. No events have occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates of any excise Taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code or any penalty or tax under Section 5.02(i) of ERISA except for any such payment or assessment as would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

   

 (e) There is no current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits or other retiree benefits for any person, retired, former or current employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, except as required by Applicable Law or under Section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA_ "). No condition exists that would prevent the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan providing health or medical benefits in respect of any current or former employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. None of the Company, any if its subsidiaries, or any Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by Applicable Law and there has been no communication to current or former employees by the Company or any of its subsidiaries which could reasonably be interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) All contributions and payments due under each Company Employee Plan, determined in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to include proportional accruals for the period ending on the Effective Time, will be discharged and paid on or prior to the Effective Time except to the extent accrued as a liability in accordance with ordinary Company practice. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. With respect to each Company Employee Plan, there are no benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued to the extent required by GAAP on the Companys financial statements. The assets of each Company Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such Company Employee Plan and, if applicable, the Companys financial statements. 

   

 (g) No employee or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will become entitled to any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or similar benefit, or the enhancement of any such benefit, as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby alone or together with any other event. Except as set forth on _Section 2.21(g)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or could limit the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee Plan or related trust. There is no Contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code, as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby alone or together with any other event. The information set forth on _Section 2.21(g)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule regarding severance arrangements for certain executive officers and certain other executives of the Company is true and correct in all material respects as of October 25, 2007.

 3.7 Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities or obligations of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet or notes thereto of Parent and its subsidiaries other than: 

  

 (a) liabilities or obligations reflected on or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto; and 

   

 (b) liabilities or obligations incurred since September 30, 2007 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be, or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Parent and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

   

 3.9 Litigation. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or affecting Parent or any of its subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions or proceedings, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or have a material adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger.

The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Companys shareholders in advance of a vote on the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 (c) Prior to the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting and provided that the Company shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.4_, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is required in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under Applicable Law, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (A) withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or (B) terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ and entering into an agreement with respect to such Superior Offer if, and only if, (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company shall have provided prompt (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior Offer_ ") advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Offer specifying all of the terms and conditions of such Superior Offer, identifying the person or entity making such Superior Offer, and providing a copy of all documentation relating to the Superior Offer, and (iii) Parent shall not, within three (3) Business Days of Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer, have made an offer (a " _Counterproposal_ ") that the Companys Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to the Companys shareholders as such Superior Offer. The Company shall provide Parent with prior notice of its intention to make such Change of Recommendation and/or take action with respect to such Superior Offer, as applicable (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), no later than (i) three (3) Business Days prior to such Change of Recommendation or other action or (ii) two (2) Business Days after any Counterproposal made by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)(B)(iii)_ (the " _Notice Period_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) if there is any revision to the financial terms or any other material term of an Acquisition Proposal which revision affects the determination of whether an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer to the Merger or any Counterproposal, the Company shall extend the Notice Period as necessary to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remain in the Notice Period and (ii) any Notice of Superior Offer shall also constitute a 

   ##### 

  

   

Notice of Change of Recommendation if Parent does not make a Counterproposal
prior to the expiration of the period set forth in _Section
5.2(c)(B)(iii_). 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Offer_ " shall mean an unsolicited, _bona fide_  written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving the Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction would, as a result of such transaction, hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving the Company), directly or indirectly, of ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisers and after taking into account, among other things, the financial, legal and regulatory aspects of such offer (including any financing required and the availability thereof), as well as any revisions to the terms hereof proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_ (including any Counterproposal)) is more favorable to the Company shareholders than the terms of the Merger (taking into account any revisions to the terms hereof proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_ (including any Counterproposal)). 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel, such disclosure is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations, or is otherwise required, under Applicable Law; provided that the Company shall not disclose a position constituting a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.2(c)_; and provided, further that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Companys Board of Directors expressly publicly reaffirms the recommendation to approve the Merger and this Agreement (x) in such communication or (y) within two (2) Business Days after requested to do so by Parent. 

   

 5.3 Confidentiality; Access to Information. 

  

 (a) The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously executed that certain confidentiality agreement dated as of November 14, 2007 between the Company and Parent, as amended to date (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, will afford the other party and the other partys accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during regular business hours to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel, as the other party 

   ##### 

  

   

may reasonably request. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.3_
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company. No information or knowledge obtained
by a party in any investigation pursuant to this  _Section 5.3_ will affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that any Applicable Law (including Applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and all applicable antitrust,
competition and similar laws, and attorney-client and other
privileges) requires the Company or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
such access and (ii) nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose
information to the extent such information would result in a waiver of
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege
or violate any confidentiality obligation of the Company existing as of the
date hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit such disclosure to be made in a
manner consistent with the protection of such privilege or to obtain any
consent required to permit such disclosure to be made without violation of

the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer, director or employee of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by the Company. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal by Parent) relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% beneficial ownership interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold or, in the case of a subsidiary of the Company, the Company holds, less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (D) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition, or disposition of any assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that generate or constitute 10% or more of the net revenue, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (E) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other reorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) The Company also shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement) request each Person that since January 1, 2006 has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible business combination with or equity investment in the Company to return (or destroy, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Company, subject to the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement; provided however, that the Company need not take the actions described in this sentence with respect to any Person if, prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made a request to such Person of the type described in this sentence and on or after the date of such request the Company has not furnished any additional Confidential Information to such Person.

 5.8 Stock Options. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option Plan, if any, pursuant to which the Company Option was issued and any option agreement between the Company and the optionee with regard to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price under such Company Option by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing the closing price of a share of Company Common Stock on the last 

   ##### 

  

   

trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market by the average closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock for the five (5) most recent days that Parent Common Stock has traded
ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
reported on the American Stock Exchange LLC (" _AMEX_ "). 

   

 (b) It is intended that Company Options assumed by Parent shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 424 of the Code (whether or not such Company Options qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code) and the provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall be applied consistent with such intent. 

   

 5.9 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days, following the Effective Time and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any such Company Options remain outstanding. 

  

 5.10 Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim or action that is based in whole or in part on, or arises in whole or in part out of, the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), to the same extent such persons are entitled to be indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, and indemnification agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries in existence on the date hereof with such persons. The Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law. 

   

 (b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company covering those persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof (the " _D andO Insurance_") for events occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company for a period of six (6) years; 

    ##### 

  

    

provided that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or is
canceled during such six-year period, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to substitute therefor policies containing terms and conditions
which are in all material respects no less favorable in the aggregate than
those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be
required in any given year to expend in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent the annual
premium would exceed 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 300% of such annual
premium). To the extent that a six-year "tail" policy to extend the Companys
existing DandO Insurance is available prior to the Closing, the Company may
obtain such "tail" policy and such "tail" policy shall satisfy Parents
obligation under this _Section 5.10(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 5.10_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. 

   

 5.11 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonably efforts to authorize for listing on AMEX the shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Merger, and the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock and pursuant to the exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent and, effective upon official notice of issuance. 

  

 5.12 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute and any regulations promulgated thereunder on such transactions. 

  

 5.13 Certain Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated) (the " _401(k) Plan(s)_ "). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors. 

   

 (b) As of the Closing Date, Parent will either (i) permit employees of the Company and each of its subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including 

   ##### 

  

   

without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or
programs, but excluding any equity based plans) of Parent on terms no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, (ii)
continue comparable Company Employee Plans other than the 401 (k) Plans
(except as otherwise provided pursuant to _Section 5.13(a)_), or (iii) a
combination of _clauses (i) and (ii)_ (it being understood that Parent shall
have no obligation to continue any Company Employee Plan not comparable to
plans or programs of Parent in effect on the Closing Date). To the extent
Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
participate in its employee benefit plans, program or policies following the
Closing Date, (A) each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of
benefit accrual) under such plan for years of service with the Company (or any
of its subsidiaries), including predecessor employers acquired directly or
indirectly by the Company prior to the Closing Date, and (B) Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which
such employees and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived to
the extent such limitations, waiting periods and requirements have already
been met under the Company Employee Plan and (2) provide for credit for any
co-payments and deductibles prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such plans that may apply after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, for a period of twelve (12) months
from and after the Closing Date, the Company severance policy, as in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof and disclosed on _Section 2.21(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply to Continuing Employees, subject
to any reasonable modifications to the benefit continuation provisions of
such policy as may be necessary to comport with any changes to the benefit
plans and programs applicable to Continuing Employees and giving service
credit for such Continuing Employees prior service with the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities). 

   

 5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by _Article 1_ of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, and the acquisition of Parent Series B Preferred Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Series B Preferred Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.15 Qualification as a Reorganization. 

  

 (i) The parties hereto intend that the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The parties shall report, act and file all Tax Returns consistent with the 

   ##### 

  

   

foregoing treatment and shall not take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such treatment, unless
required to do so by Applicable Law. 

   

 (ii) None of the parties hereto is aware of any facts or circumstances that would preclude the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, from qualifying for treatment as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

   

 (iii) Each of the parties hereto agrees not to take any action (or fail to take any action), either prior to or following the Closing, that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, to qualify as "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. 

   

 5.16 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause each of Merger Sub and Merger LLC to comply with all of their respective obligations under or relating to this Agreement.

 5.19 Upstream Merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into Merger LLC. From and after the effectiveness of the Upstream Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger LLC shall continue as the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and all of the rights and obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement shall be deemed the rights and obligations of the Surviving Company. The Upstream Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Parent and Merger LLC shall take all steps and actions as shall be required to cause the Surviving Corporation and Merger LLC to consummate the Upstream Merger as set forth in this _Section 5.19_.

Parent agrees to prepare and file a Certificate of Designations with respect to the Parent Series B Preferred Stock in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and containing the terms set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and other customary terms as to which the parties will negotiate in good faith.

Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect, except as set forth in this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_
and _Article 8_, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms. 

  

 7.3 Fees and Expenses. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the printing and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials related thereto) and the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto (including SEC filing fees).

_however_ , that in the case of a termination under _Sections 7.1(b) or

shall pay the Termination Fee contemporaneously with the termination of this
Agreement. 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay in a timely manner amounts due pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent makes a claim for such amounts that results in a judgment against the other for the amounts described in  _Section 7.3(b)_, the judgment debtor shall pay to the judgment creditor its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses as provided in _Section 8.7(b)_ ) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts described in  _Section 7.3(b)_ (at the prime rate of Bank of America in effect on the date such payment was required to be made) from such date until the payment of such amount (together with such accrued interest). The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by Company pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, the right to receive such amount shall constitute such partys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement other than with respect

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

to a willful or intentional material breach of this Agreement; provided,
however, that acceptance by Parent of the Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall constitute Parents sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach of this Agreement, including with respect to any breach
of _Section 5.4_. In no event shall the Termination Fee be payable on more
than one occasion or as a result of more than one event.

 7.4 Amendment. Subject to Applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment of this Agreement shall be made which by law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without obtaining such approval. 

  

 7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
