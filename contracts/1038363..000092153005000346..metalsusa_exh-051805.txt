                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of the 18th day of May, 2005, by and among Flag Holdings
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Flag Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
Metals USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MUSA").


                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and MUSA desire that Parent acquire all of
the capital stock of MUSA through the merger of Merger Sub with and into MUSA,
with MUSA as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), pursuant to which each
share of Common Stock of MUSA, par value $.01 per share ("MUSA Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, excluding shares of MUSA Common
Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or MUSA (or any of their respective direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) and other than the Appraisal Shares, will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, all as more fully
provided in this Agreement; and

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent and certain MUSA Stockholders are entering into a Support
Agreement, of even date herewith, in respect of shares of MUSA Common Stock
beneficially owned by such stockholders (the "Support Agreement"); and

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Merger Sub and Lourenco Goncalves are entering into an
employment agreement, of even date herewith (the "Employment Agreement"); and

          WHEREAS, it is Parent's current expectation that one or more members
of the management of MUSA will have equity interests in Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from and after the consummation of the Merger; and

          WHEREAS, the board of directors (the "Board") of each of Merger Sub
and MUSA has determined that the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, is advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders; and

          WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and MUSA desire to make those
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

          1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub ---- shall be merged with and into MUSA
at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and MUSA shall continue its existence as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent under the laws of the State of Delaware. MUSA,
in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

          1.2. Closing; Effective Time. A closing (the "Closing") shall be held
at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
NY 10019, or such other place as the parties hereto may agree, as soon as
practicable but no later than the second business day following the date upon
which all conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or waived, or at such
other date as Parent and MUSA may agree (such date, the "Closing Date"). As
promptly as possible on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware
Secretary of State") of a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in
such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be
agreed upon by Parent and MUSA and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

          1.3. Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

          1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Certificate of
Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Surviving
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the
provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior thereto in
Merger Sub's Certificate of Incorporation, except that the Surviving
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation also shall be amended to provide that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Metals USA, Inc." and (b) Merger
Sub's Bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Surviving Corporation's Bylaws; in each case, until amended in accordance with
the DGCL and subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(a)(iii).

          1.5. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, the officers of MUSA shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified. On or prior to the Closing Date, MUSA shall deliver
to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent of the resignations of the directors
of MUSA, such resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time.

          1.6. MUSA Stockholders Meeting.

          (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
MUSA shall, in accordance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules or
regulations promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, to the extent applicable (collectively,
"Applicable Laws") and MUSA's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "MUSA Certificate") and MUSA's
Amended and Restated Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the
"MUSA Bylaws"), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of shares of MUSA Common Stock (the "MUSA Stockholders") to consider and
vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "MUSA
Stockholders Meeting"). MUSA shall ensure that the MUSA Stockholders Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the MUSA Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
Applicable Laws.

          (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, MUSA shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") a proxy statement (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement," and together with each
other document required to be filed by MUSA with the Commission relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, the "MUSA Disclosure
Documents") that meets the requirements of Applicable Laws to seek the approval
of this Agreement and the Merger. MUSA shall respond promptly to any comments
made by the Commission with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary
version thereof filed by it, and shall cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the MUSA Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable. MUSA shall
promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of the Commission with
respect to the Proxy Statement and any other MUSA Disclosure Document, and shall
provide to Parent copies of any comments received from the Commission in
connection with the Proxy Statement and any other MUSA Disclosure Document.
Parent will cooperate with MUSA at its reasonable request in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement, including furnishing to MUSA the information relating to it
and Merger Sub required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange
Act") to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all MUSA Disclosure
Documents, including the Proxy Statement and all mailings to the MUSA
Stockholders in connection with the Merger prior to their being filed with the
Commission or mailed, as applicable, and MUSA shall give reasonable
consideration to all comments proposed by Parent or its counsel.

          (c) The MUSA Board shall make the MUSA Board Recommendation. The MUSA
Board Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement, and the MUSA
Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the necessary approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the MUSA Stockholders. In the event
that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the MUSA Board determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Laws require it to withdraw, modify or qualify the MUSA Board Recommendation in
a manner adverse to Parent, the MUSA Board may so withdraw, modify or qualify
the MUSA Board Recommendation; provided, however, that the MUSA Board may not
recommend any Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement and the
transactions


                                      -3-

contemplated hereby, including the Merger), except as specifically contemplated
by, and in accordance with, Section 5.3(b)(iii); provided, further, however,
that unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated, MUSA shall nevertheless
submit this Agreement to the MUSA Stockholders for adoption at the MUSA
Stockholders Meeting.

          1.7. Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to
(a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of MUSA or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, MUSA and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted
to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts
necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of MUSA or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

                                   ARTICLE II

respective stockholders:

          (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued
     and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
     into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par
     value, of the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall
     thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving
     Corporation capital stock.

          (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
     MUSA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time (excluding any shares of MUSA Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub
     or MUSA or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
     subsidiaries (which shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with
     no payment being made with respect thereto) and any shares of MUSA Common
     Stock owned by stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant
     to Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") (which shares shall have the
     rights as provided in Section 2.1(d))) shall be converted into and
     represent the right to receive $22.00 in cash, without interest (the
     "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of MUSA Common
     Stock shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled
     and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
     prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of MUSA Common Stock (a
     "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
     the right to receive the Merger Consideration or, in the case of holders of
     Appraisal Shares, the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in
     Section 2.1(d).


                                      -4-

<PAGE>


          (c) Each share of MUSA capital stock held in the treasury of MUSA
     automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made
     in respect thereof.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
     shares of MUSA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time that are held by any MUSA Stockholder that is entitled to
     demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of MUSA Common Stock
     pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
     262 (the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
     receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), but,
     instead, such MUSA Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only
     such rights) as are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all
     Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be
     cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by
     Applicable Laws, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any
     rights with respect to the Appraisal Shares, other than such rights as are
     granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such MUSA
     Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive,
     withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of
     competent jurisdiction shall determine that such MUSA Stockholder is not
     entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the rights of such
     MUSA Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease, and such Appraisal Shares
     shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
     shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
     provided in Section 2.1(b) without interest. MUSA shall give prompt notice
     to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of MUSA Common Stock,
     and Parent shall have the opportunity to reasonably participate in all
     negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. MUSA shall not,
     without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
     to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of
     the foregoing.

          2.2. Surrender and Payment.

          (a) Paying Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the MUSA Stockholders, Parent shall designate, or shall cause to be
designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to MUSA), a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to MUSA to act
as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates
upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with this Article II from time
to time after the Effective Time (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (assuming no Appraisal Shares
but taking into account any MUSA securities to be rolled over or otherwise
converted into Parent equity after the Effective Time) upon surrender of such
Certificates (such cash, the "Exchange Fund"); provided, however, the portion of
such aggregate Merger Consideration allocable to Appraisal Shares shall be
returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, upon demand by and at the
direction of Parent. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis.

          (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a form of


                                      -5-


<PAGE>


letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such MUSA Stockholder shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the
shares of MUSA Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of MUSA Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer books of MUSA, the proper amount of
cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

          (c) Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the day on which
the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of MUSA shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of MUSA Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

          (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, MUSA or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent for payment to the holders of
unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed six months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent (along with all other funds in the Exchange Fund,
including any interest and other income resulting from investments of the
Exchange Fund), after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall
look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of the funds to which the
holder of unsurrendered Certificates may be due, subject to Applicable Laws. If
any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such date as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

          (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may


                                      -6-

<PAGE>


reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

          (f) No Further Ownership Rights in MUSA Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of
Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of MUSA Common Stock represented thereby.

          (g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any MUSA Stockholders or holders of MUSA Options or MUSA Deferred
Stock Rights such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the MUSA Stockholders or
holders of MUSA Options or MUSA Deferred Stock Rights, as the case may be, in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

          2.3. Treatment of Stock Options; Deferred Stock; Warrants.

          (a) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, as of the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of MUSA Common Stock (a "MUSA
Option") granted under the Metals USA, Inc. 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
"2002 Plan") or otherwise that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (whether or not vested) (which MUSA Options, in the aggregate, shall not be
exercisable for a number of shares of MUSA Common Stock exceeding that number
set forth in Section 4.4(a)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, MUSA, Parent or Merger Sub, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash (less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest) equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
per share exercise price of MUSA Common Stock subject to such MUSA Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of MUSA Common Stock subject to such
MUSA Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time,
all MUSA Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a MUSA Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the payment described in the
immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election
of Parent, all or any portion of the MUSA Options held by any employee of MUSA
or its subsidiaries that enters into an employment agreement or other
arrangement with Merger Sub or Parent shall not be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive cash as provided above, but shall instead be converted into
options to purchase the stock of either Parent or Surviving Corporation in
compliance with the requirements of Section 409 of the Code and any regulations
thereunder; provided, however, if Parent desires to make such an election, it
must do


                                      -7-


<PAGE>


so no later than three business days prior to the Closing Date by delivering
written notice to MUSA listing the names of the holders of MUSA Options (and the
number of such holders' MUSA Options to be converted into Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's options, the exercise price of such new options and the
number and type of shares of Parent or the Surviving Corporation subject to such
new options) whose MUSA Options shall be converted, in whole or in part, into
options to purchase the stock of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to
the Effective Time, MUSA, the MUSA Board and the compensation committee of the
MUSA Board (the "Committee") shall take any and all actions necessary under the
2002 Plan, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this
Section 2.3(a), including amending the 2002 Plan.

          (b) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, as of the
Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested right to receive one share of MUSA
Common Stock ("MUSA Deferred Stock Right") granted under the 2002 Plan or
otherwise (which MUSA Deferred Stock Rights, in the aggregate, shall not exceed
that number set forth in Section 4.4(a)), shall, without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, MUSA, Parent or Merger Sub, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive, from Parent or from the Surviving Corporation, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (less any
applicable withholding taxes and without interest) equal to the Merger
Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all MUSA Deferred Stock Rights shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of
MUSA Deferred Stock Rights shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the payment described in the immediately preceding
sentence. Prior to the Effective Time, MUSA, the MUSA Board and the Committee
shall take any and all actions necessary under the 2002 Plan, the award
agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this Section 2.3(b), including
amending the 2002 Plan.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, MUSA shall ensure that, except with
respect to the portion of MUSA Options for which Parent has made an election in
accordance to Section 2.3(a), following the Effective Time, no holder of a MUSA
Option, holder of a MUSA Deferred Stock Right or participant in the 2002 Plan or
other employee benefit arrangement of MUSA shall have any right thereunder to
acquire or receive any capital stock (including payment of cash in settlement of
any unit award, "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of MUSA or the
Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, MUSA shall deliver to the
holders of MUSA Options, holders of MUSA Deferred Stock Rights and other
participants in the 2002 Plan appropriate notices, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders' or participants'
rights pursuant to this Agreement.

          (d) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions set forth herein, as
of the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase MUSA Common Stock ("MUSA
Warrants") issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement by and between MUSA and
Equiserve Trust Company, N.A., dated as of October 31, 2002 (the "Warrant
Agreement"), or otherwise, shall, in accordance with the Warrant Agreement and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, MUSA, Parent or Merger
Sub, no longer represent the right to receive shares of MUSA Common Stock upon
the due exercise thereof, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive
(upon surrender of such MUSA Warrant and the payment to the Surviving
Corporation of the exercise price thereunder) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of MUSA Common Stock subject to such MUSA
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time,


                                      -8-

<PAGE>


multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, MUSA
shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.3(d),
including (x) no later than twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time,
delivering to the holders of MUSA Warrants and the warrant agent under the
Warrant Agreement the notice required to be given by it pursuant to Section 12.2
of the Warrant Agreement and (y) executing and delivering to the warrant agent
under the Warrant Agreement the written instrument required to be executed and
delivered by it pursuant to Section 5.1(h) of the Warrant Agreement. On the
Closing Date, MUSA shall, in accordance with Sections 3.2(b)(ii) and 12.1 of the
Warrant Agreement, give notice to the Warrant Agent (as defined in the Warrant
Agreement) and the holders of MUSA Warrants that MUSA has elected to accelerate
the expiration of the MUSA Warrants to the 60th day following the Closing Date.

          2.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that MUSA changes
the number of shares of MUSA Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of MUSA Common Stock, issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance
with this sentence.

                                  ARTICLE III

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

          In order to induce MUSA to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub represent and warrant to MUSA that the statements contained in this
Article III are true, correct and complete.

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state of Delaware with full corporate power and authority to own, lease,
use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where now

by this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub. No
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by MUSA, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Merger Sub and Parent enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) is subject to general
principles of equity.

<PAGE>


          3.3. Conflicts; Consents and Approvals. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will:

          (a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of Parent's
     Certificate of Incorporation, or Parent's Bylaws, or Merger Sub's
     Certificate of Incorporation or Merger Sub's Bylaws;

          (b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision
     of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of notice,
     the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under, or
     entitle any Person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
     otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or
     result in the creation of any lien, security interest, pledge, mortgage,
     charge, option, hypothecation, easement, restriction or other encumbrance

     its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
     note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, contract,
     undertaking, agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which
     Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party;

          (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
     regulation applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their
     respective properties or assets; or

          (d) require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or
     registration or filing by Parent or any of its subsidiaries with, any third
     party or any local, domestic, foreign or multinational court, arbitral
     tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
     regulatory body, agency, instrumentality or authority (each of the
     foregoing, a "Governmental Authority"), other than (i) actions required by
     the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended

     other applicable takeover laws and (iii) the filing with the Delaware
     Secretary of State of the Certificate of Merger;

except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above for any of the foregoing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          3.4. Brokerage and Finders' Fees. Except for Parent's obligations to
Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their
respective directors, officers or employees has incurred or will incur on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub any brokerage, finders', advisory or similar fee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          3.5. Information Supplied.

          (a) The information with respect to Parent and its subsidiaries that
Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate thereof furnishes to MUSA in writing
specifically for use in any


                                      -10-


<PAGE>


MUSA Disclosure Document will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (i) in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to MUSA Stockholders,
at the time the MUSA Stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement and at the
Effective Time, and (ii) in the case of any MUSA Disclosure Document other than
the Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing thereof, at the time of any
distribution thereof and at the time of the MUSA Stockholders Meeting.

          (b) The Parent Disclosure Documents, if and when filed, will comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and will not at the time of the filing thereof or at the time of
any distribution thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided, however, that this representation and warranty will not apply to
statements or omissions in the Parent Disclosure Documents based upon (i)
information in the Proxy Statement (other than information with respect to
Parent and its subsidiaries furnished by Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate
thereof to MUSA in writing specifically for use in the Proxy Statement) or (ii)
information furnished to Parent in writing by MUSA specifically for use therein.

          3.6. Financing. Parent has delivered to MUSA copies of (a) a
commitment letter, dated May 18, 2005 (the "Equity Financing Letter"), pursuant
to which Apollo Management V, L.P. has committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to contribute (or cause to be contributed) capital
to Parent (the "Equity Financing"), and (b) a commitment letter dated May 13,
2005 (the "Debt Financing Agreement" and, together with the Equity Financing
Letter, the "Financing Agreements"), pursuant to which Credit Suisse First
Boston and CIBC World Markets Corp. have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to (i) make senior secured increasing rate bridge
loans to Merger Sub, and (ii) enter into a credit agreement providing for senior
secured asset-based revolving loans to Merger Sub (the "Debt Financing"). As
used in this Agreement, the financing to be provided under clause (a) above
shall be referred to as the "Equity Financing", the financing to be provided
under clause (b) above shall be referred to as the "Debt Financing", and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing shall collectively be referred to as the
"Financing." The aggregate proceeds of the Financing are in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, to pay the amounts required under Section 2.3(a)
and 2.3(b), to pay the amounts required to holders of MUSA Warrants if such
holders exercise such MUSA Warrants on or after the Closing Date (taking into
account the payment of the exercise price by such holders to MUSA or the
Surviving Corporation), to repay certain existing indebtedness of MUSA and its
subsidiaries in accordance with Section 5.1(f) and to pay related fees and
expenses (such amounts, the "Required Amounts"). As of the date hereof, none of
the Financing Agreements has been withdrawn and Parent does not know of any
facts or circumstances that may reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Agreements not being satisfied.

          3.7. Capitalization of Merger Sub. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and


                                      -11-


<PAGE>


outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing).

          3.8. Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, and at
no time during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of
MUSA (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns
(directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record), or is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of MUSA (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreement).

          3.9. Solvency. As of the date hereof, Parent believes, based upon its
current understanding of the business, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, operations, prospects and condition (financial and otherwise) of
MUSA and its subsidiaries, and assuming that (a) the representations and
warranties of MUSA set forth in Article IV are true and correct as of the date
hereof and will be true and correct as of the Closing Date, (b) the projections
of the performance (financial and otherwise) of MUSA and its subsidiaries
provided by MUSA to Parent are accurate and correct and reflect the actual
future performance of MUSA, (c) the due diligence materials provided to Parent
prior to the date hereof by or on behalf of MUSA are true, correct and complete
as of the date hereof and will be so true, correct and complete as of the
Closing Date, (d) prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any
event, change, circumstance, effect or state of facts that is or has a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of MUSA and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (e)
assuming the Financing shall have been obtained on terms substantially
comparable to those reflected in the Financing Agreements that, upon
consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will not have unreasonably
small capital to conduct its business, and will generally be able to pay its
obligations as they become due in the ordinary course.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MUSA

          In order to induce Merger Sub and Parent to enter into this Agreement,
MUSA hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true, correct and complete.

          4.1. Organization and Standing. MUSA is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased, used,
operated and conducted. Each of MUSA's subsidiaries is an organization duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation with full corporate power and authority to

conducted by it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in such
jurisdiction would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MUSA. MUSA is not in default in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of the MUSA
Certificate or the MUSA Bylaws. MUSA has heretofore furnished to Parent complete
and correct copies of the MUSA Certificate and the MUSA Bylaws and the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents for
each of MUSA's subsidiaries.

          4.2. Subsidiaries. MUSA does not own, directly or indirectly, any

date of this Agreement (the "MUSA Disclosure Schedule"). MUSA is not subject to
any obligation or requirement to provide funds to or make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such entity or any
other Person. MUSA owns, directly or indirectly, each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of its subsidiaries. Each of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of each of
MUSA's subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

all Encumbrances. The following information for each of MUSA's subsidiaries is

name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization; (b) its authorized
capital stock or share capital; and (c) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or share capital and the record owner(s) thereof. There
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements,
understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale or transfer of any securities of any of MUSA's subsidiaries,
nor are there outstanding any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests of any of MUSA's subsidiaries.

          4.3. Corporate Power and Authority. MUSA has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the MUSA
Stockholders, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution, performance and delivery of this Agreement by MUSA have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of MUSA, subject to
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the MUSA Stockholders, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of MUSA
are necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by MUSA, and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of MUSA enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of

     entitle any Person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
     otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or
     result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the properties or
     assets of MUSA or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms,

employee or affiliate of MUSA, has incurred or will incur on behalf of MUSA or
its subsidiaries, any brokerage, finders', advisory or similar fee in connection

the date of such amending or superseding filing) (i) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees

Parent copies of any written materials relating to the foregoing. MUSA has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to MUSA,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to MUSA's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of MUSA, such

principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in MUSA's periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act. Except as set forth in

specifically provided in the foregoing documents provided to Parent, there are
no amendments to any Plan that have been adopted or approved, nor has MUSA or
any of its subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or
approve any new Plan.

          (c) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination
letter with respect to each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code) (a "Qualified Plan"). Except
as set forth on Section 4.15(c) of the MUSA Disclosure Schedule, there are no
existing circumstances nor any events that have occurred that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or
the related trust.

          (d) Except as set forth on Section 4.15(d) of the MUSA Disclosure
Schedule, all contributions required to be made by MUSA or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to any Plan by
Applicable Laws or by the terms of any Plan and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Plan, for any period through the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full and through the Closing Date will
be timely made or paid in full.

          (e) MUSA and its subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates
have complied, and are now in compliance with all provisions of ERISA, the Code
and all laws and regulations (including any local Applicable Laws) applicable to
the Plans in all material respects. Each Plan has been operated in compliance
with its terms in all material respects. There is not now, and to the knowledge
of MUSA there are no existing circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan
or the imposition of any Encumbrance on the assets of MUSA or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the
Code.

          (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.15(f) of the MUSA Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
or 4971 of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 4.15(f) of the MUSA
Disclosure Schedule, no Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of

more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control
(within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA) (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), nor
has MUSA or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates,
at any time within six years before the date of this Agreement, contributed to
or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan. Each Plan that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the
Code meets the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412
of the Code (without regard to any funding waiver). Neither MUSA nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates is required to provide security to such Plan pursuant to
Section 307


                                      -22-

have been no amendments to such Plan that materially increase the present value
of accrued benefits.

          (g) There does not now exist, and there are no existing circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in, any material Controlled Group
Liability that would be a liability of MUSA or any of its subsidiaries following
the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither MUSA nor
any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has engaged
in any transaction described in Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

          (h) Except for health continuation coverage as required by Section
4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and except as set forth on
Section 4.15(h) of the MUSA Disclosure Schedule, neither MUSA nor any of its
subsidiaries has any material liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof.
There has been no communication to employees of MUSA or any of its subsidiaries
that could reasonably be expected or interpreted to promise or guarantee such
employees retiree health or life insurance benefits or other retiree death
benefits on a permanent basis.

          (i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) of the MUSA Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in,
cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or consultant of
MUSA or any of its subsidiaries (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or
payable by MUSA or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either solely as a result thereof or as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in conjunction with any other
events, will be an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code). Section 4.15(i) of the MUSA Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the maximum aggregate amount of any such excess parachute payments.

          (j) There are no pending, or, to the knowledge of MUSA, threatened,
Actions (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that have been
asserted or instituted against any Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to any Plan or the assets of any of the trusts under any Plan that
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of MUSA or any
of its subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the United
States Department of the Treasury, the United States Department of Labor or any
Multiemployer Plan.

          (k) No Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States.

          (l) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(l) of the MUSA Disclosure
Schedule, no disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for
employee reimbursement or compensation of any amount paid or payable by MUSA or
any of its subsidiaries has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur.

          (m) Since January 1, 2003, MUSA and its subsidiaries have been and are
in compliance in all material respects with Applicable Laws with respect to
employment,

relations, safety and health, wages, hours and terms and conditions of
employment. MUSA and its subsidiaries have complied with their payment
obligations to all employees of MUSA and its subsidiaries in respect of all

of Regulation S-K of the Commission) (the contracts listed in Section 4.16(a) of
the MUSA Disclosure Schedule or such exhibit list being referred to as the
"Material Contracts"). Each such Material Contract is a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of MUSA or its subsidiaries and, to MUSA's knowledge, of
the other party or parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, and in full
force and effect, except where the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and
in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MUSA. MUSA has not
received any notice from any other party to any such Material Contract, and
otherwise has no knowledge that such third party intends to terminate, or not
renew, any such Material Contract. Prior to the date hereof, MUSA has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all such Material
Contracts. Neither MUSA nor any of its subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of
MUSA, no other party thereto, is in violation of or in default under (nor does

<PAGE>


lease, license, or other agreement to use, all assets and properties (in each
case, tangible and intangible) necessary and desirable to permit MUSA and its
subsidiaries to conduct their business as currently conducted, except for such
failures to hold valid titles or rights to lease that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on MUSA. The assets and properties (in each case, tangible and
intangible) owned or used by MUSA and its subsidiaries are in satisfactory

Real Property, (iii) an identification of the applicable lease, sublease or
other agreement therefor and any and all amendments, modifications, side letters

ordinary conduct of business, subject to reasonable wear and tear between the
date hereof and the Closing Date. All of the leases, subleases and other
agreements (each, a "Lease Agreement") pursuant to which MUSA or its
subsidiaries occupy the Leased Real Property are valid, binding and in full
force and effect. True and complete copies of the Lease Agreements have
previously been delivered to Parent. To MUSA's knowledge, there are no
outstanding defaults or circumstances which, upon the giving of notice or
passage of time or both, would constitute a default or breach by either party
under any Lease Agreement. There is no pending or, to MUSA's knowledge,
threatened proceeding that is reasonably likely to interfere with the quiet
enjoyment of any lessee or sublessee of a Leased Real Property. "Permitted
Encumbrances" means (i) liens and encumbrances consisting of zoning or planning
restrictions, easements, permits and other restrictions or limitations on the
use of real property or irregularities in title thereto, in each case, that do
not materially detract from the value of, or materially impair the use of, such
property by MUSA or any of its subsidiaries in the operation of their respective
business, (ii) liens and encumbrances of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics,
suppliers, materialmen or repairmen arising in the ordinary course of business

reflected on the balance sheet of MUSA as of December 31, 2004 included in the
MUSA SEC Documents or thereafter acquired (and not subsequently sold in the
ordinary course of business) consists of items of a quality and quantity useable
and saleable in the ordinary course of the business of


                                      -28-


<PAGE>


MUSA and its subsidiaries as quality goods at prices having a value at least
equal to the amount reflected on the balance sheet of MUSA as of December 31,
2004 included in the MUSA SEC Documents, except as to obsolete and below
standard quality inventory, the value of which has been written down on the
balance sheet of MUSA as of December 31, 2004 included in the MUSA SEC Documents
and on MUSA's books and records to realizable market value. All items of
inventory are valued on the balance sheet of MUSA as of December 31, 2004
included in the MUSA SEC Documents at the lower of cost or estimated realizable
market value, in accordance with GAAP. The inventories and supplies for the
business of MUSA and its subsidiaries are at adequate levels for the
continuation of the business of MUSA and its subsidiaries (assuming the
continuation of operations as currently conducted).

          4.24. Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable of MUSA and its
subsidiaries that are reflected on the balance sheet of MUSA as of December 31,
2004 included in the MUSA SEC Documents constitute all of the accounts
receivable of MUSA and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, other than
those reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts on such balance sheet.
All of such accounts receivable represent, and those existing on the Closing
Date will represent, valid obligations arising from sales actually made or
services actually performed and are not and will not be subject to any material
contest, claim, or right of set-off, other than returns and adjustments in the
ordinary course of business.

          4.25. Books and Records. The books and records of MUSA and its
subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in material
compliance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and such books and
records accurately reflect in all material respects all dealings and
transactions in respect of the business, assets, liabilities and affairs of MUSA
and its subsidiaries.

          4.26. Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 4.26
of the MUSA Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding amounts payable to or
receivable from, or advances by MUSA or any of its subsidiaries to, and neither
MUSA nor any of its subsidiaries is otherwise a creditor or debtor to, or party
to any contract, agreement or transaction with, any holder of 5% or more of MUSA
Common Stock or any director, officer, employee or affiliate of MUSA or any of
its subsidiaries, or to MUSA's knowledge any relative of any of the foregoing,
except for employment or compensation agreements or arrangements with directors,
officers and employees made in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice. Since December 31, 2004, no event has occurred that would be required
to be reported by MUSA under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
Commission.

          4.27. Opinion of Jefferies & Co. Inc. The MUSA Board has received the
written opinion of Jefferies & Co. Inc., dated as of the date of this Agreement,
to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
received by the MUSA Stockholders pursuant to the Merger is fair to the MUSA
Stockholders (other than Parent and its affiliates and other than MUSA
Stockholders who will have a continuing investment in Parent or Surviving
Corporation) from a financial point of view. MUSA shall provide a complete and
correct signed copy of such opinion to Parent solely for informational purposes
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

          4.28. Board Recommendation; Required Vote. The MUSA Board, at a
meeting duly called and held, has, by unanimous vote of those directors present
and voting with the only director then in office not voting being C. Lourenco
Goncalves, who abstained from the vote, (a) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of the MUSA Stockholders; (b) declared advisable
and in all respects approved and adopted this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the transactions contemplated by the
Employment Agreement and the Support Agreement), including the Merger, taking
into account the terms of the Support Agreement; and (c) resolved to recommend
that the MUSA Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the
"MUSA Board Recommendation"), and the MUSA Board Recommendation has not been
withdrawn, modified, qualified or otherwise changed in a manner adverse to
Parent, provided that any withdrawal, modification or qualification of such
recommendation in accordance with Section 1.6(c) shall not be deemed a breach of
this representation. Assuming that the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in Section 3.8 are true and correct, the affirmative
vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of MUSA Common Stock to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of MUSA necessary to approve and adopt
this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger.

          4.29. Section 203 of the DGCL. Prior to the date of this Agreement,
the MUSA Board has taken all action necessary so that the restrictions on
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with
respect to or as a result of this Agreement, the Support Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, without any
further action on the part of the MUSA Stockholders or the MUSA Board. No other
state takeover statute is applicable to the Merger.

          5.2. Covenants of Parent.

          (a) Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

               (i) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee,
          officer or director of MUSA or any of its subsidiaries may have under
          any employment agreement or Plan or under the MUSA Certificate or the
          MUSA Bylaws, after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
          the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
          and former officer and director of MUSA and its subsidiaries (the
          "Indemnified Directors and Officers"), against all claims, losses,
          liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
          costs and expenses, including, attorneys' fees and disbursements
          (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any Action,
          whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
          of acts or omission taken or omitted to be taken by them in their
          capacity as officers or directors at or prior to the Effective Time
          (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
          contemplated hereby), or taken by them at or prior to the Effective
          Time at the request of MUSA or any MUSA subsidiary, whether asserted
          or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
          extent permitted under Applicable Laws for a period of six years from
          and after the Effective Time and to the extent provided for in the
          MUSA Certificate and the MUSA Bylaws. Each Indemnified Director and
          Officer will be entitled, to the extent provided for in the MUSA
          Certificate and the MUSA Bylaws, to advancement of expenses incurred
          in the defense of any Action from the Surviving Corporation.

               (ii) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
          Persons serving as directors and officers of MUSA immediately prior to
          the Effective Time to be covered by directors' and officers' liability
          insurance policy(ies) maintained by Surviving Corporation, with
          limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable as those in the
          existing policies of MUSA, for a period of six years from and after
          the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
          to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent may substitute therefor a
          single premium tail coverage with respect to directors' and officers'
          liability insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
          Effective Time that were committed by such directors and officers in
          their capacities as such, with policy limits, terms and conditions at
          least as favorable as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing
          policies of MUSA (or with such other limits, terms and conditions as
          permitted by the final two provisos of this sentence); provided,
          further, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend an amount
          pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)(ii) in excess of 200% of the current
          annual premium paid by MUSA for its existing coverage in the aggregate
          (the "Insurance Amount"); and provided, further, that if Parent is
          unable to obtain tail coverage with policy limits, terms and
          conditions at least as favorable to the limits, terms and conditions
          in the existing policies of MUSA as a result of the preceding
          provision, Parent shall obtain the most advantageous tail coverage as
          is available for the Insurance Amount.

               (iii) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
          Surviving Corporation shall continue to contain provisions no less
          favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
          exculpation of the Indemnified Directors


                                      -33-


<PAGE>


          and Officers than are presently set forth in the MUSA Certificate and
          the MUSA Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
          otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time
          in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
          such individuals.

               (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
          Action (whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made
          against any Indemnified Director or Officer or any other party covered
          by directors' and officers' liability insurance, on or prior to the
          sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
          Section 5.2(a) shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
          such Action.

               (v) This Section 5.2(a) is intended to be for the benefit of, and
          shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and
          Officers and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The
          indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
          any other rights to which an Indemnified Director or Officer is
          entitled, whether pursuant to Applicable Laws, contract or otherwise,
          which contracts or other arrangements are listed in Section 5.2(a)(v)
          of the MUSA Disclosure Schedule.

               (vi) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
          successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other
          Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
          entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all
          or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety in
          one or a series of related transactions to any Person(s), then, and in
          each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing
          or surviving corporation or entity or such Persons(s), as the case may
          be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.2(a);
          provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be relieved from
          such obligation. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not
          distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets
          in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving
          Corporation (or any successor or assignee of its obligations
          hereunder) unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section
          5.2(a).

          (b) Financing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Financing within 30 days after all of the conditions in Article VI (other
than the condition set forth in Section 6.2(d)) have been satisfied or are
capable of being satisfied, on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Financing Agreements. Parent shall keep MUSA informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of the financing process relating thereto. In the event that
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, Parent will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the proceeds from
the Equity Financing, to pay the Required Amounts) on substantially comparable
or more favorable terms from other sources within 30 days after all of the
conditions in Article VI (other than the condition set forth in Section 6.2(d))
have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and (ii) promptly notify
MUSA of such unavailability and the reason therefor. From the date hereof until
the first to occur of a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
VII or the Effective Time, Parent will not, without the prior written consent of
MUSA, (A) amend either of the Financing Agreements in order to include
additional conditions to the consummation of the Financing, except for
additional conditions that in the ordinary course would be satisfied at or prior
to the time the other


                                      -34-


<PAGE>


conditions herein and therein would be satisfied or (B) terminate either of the
Financing Agreements, unless the Debt Financing becomes unavailable and Parent
is using its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in
accordance with this Section 5.2(b).

          (c) Disclosure Documents. Parent shall promptly prepare and file
(separately, or as part of the Proxy Statement) with the Commission, if
required, a Rule 13E-3 Transaction Statement (the "Transaction Statement") with
respect to the Merger (together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
collectively, the "Parent Disclosure Documents") that will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. MUSA
and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Transaction Statement prior to its being filed with the Commission.

          5.3. Covenants of MUSA.

          (a) Conduct of MUSA's Operations. From the date hereof until the first
to occur of a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII or
the Effective Time, MUSA shall and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to
conduct its business and operate its properties in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and MUSA shall and shall cause each of
its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its
business organization and relationships with third parties and to keep available
the services of its present officers and employees. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except with the prior written consent of Parent or
as required by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the MUSA
Disclosure Schedule, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, MUSA shall
not:

               (i) do or effect any of the following actions with respect to its
          securities or the securities of its subsidiaries: (A) adjust, split,
          combine or reclassify MUSA capital stock or that of its subsidiaries,
          (B) make, declare or pay any dividend or distribution on (other than

          subsidiary of MUSA to its parent), or, directly or indirectly, redeem,
          purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of MUSA capital stock or
          that of its subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible
          into or exchangeable for any shares of MUSA capital stock or that of
          its subsidiaries, (C) grant any Person any right or option to acquire
          any shares of MUSA capital stock or that of its subsidiaries or any

          stock or that of its subsidiaries, (D) issue, deliver, sell, pledge or
          encumber or agree to issue, deliver, sell, pledge or encumber any
          shares of MUSA capital stock or any securities or obligations
          convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of MUSA
          capital stock or such securities (except pursuant to (1) the exercise
          of MUSA Options that are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
          and in accordance with the existing terms of such MUSA Options, (2)
          the vesting of any MUSA Deferred Stock Right outstanding as of the
          date of this Agreement, or (3) issuances of shares of MUSA Common
          Stock upon conversion of MUSA Warrants) or the capital stock or such
          securities of its subsidiaries, or (E) enter into any agreement,
          understanding or arrangement with respect to the sale, voting,

          subsidiaries;

               (ii) directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, lease, pledge,

               (xviii) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the
          foregoing actions.

          (b) Acquisition Proposals.

               (i) Subject to Section 5.3(b)(iii), MUSA agrees that neither it
          nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of
          it or its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its
          subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any
          investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
          subsidiaries) ("Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
          initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries with respect
          to, or the making of, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in any
          negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or
          data to, have any discussions with, any individual, corporation,
          general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
          venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
          Authority or other entity of any kind or nature (each, a "Person")
          relating to, or otherwise facilitate, an Acquisition Proposal, (C)
          approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
          Acquisition Proposal or (D) approve or recommend, or determine to
          approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
          agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
          option agreement or other similar agreement (other than a
          confidentiality agreement as contemplated by and in accordance with
          Section 5.3(b)(iii)) or propose publicly or agree to do any of the
          foregoing relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

               (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
          nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MUSA or the MUSA
          Board from complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections
          14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
          Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if the MUSA Board either
          (A) does not re-affirm the MUSA Board Recommendation in any such
          disclosure document or communication or (B) subject to the compliance
          with the other provisions of this Section 5.3(b), withdraws, modifies
          or qualifies the approval of this Agreement by the MUSA Board or the
          MUSA Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in such
          disclosure documents or communications, then, in either such case,
          Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent
          set forth in Section 7.4(a) of this Agreement.

               (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
          nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MUSA or the MUSA
          Board from at any time prior to, but not after, the time this
          Agreement is approved and adopted by the MUSA Stockholders at the MUSA
          Stockholders Meeting, (A) providing information in response to a
          request therefor by, or engaging in any negotiations or discussions
          with, a Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written
          Acquisition Proposal (and with respect to such Person and Acquisition
          Proposal, MUSA has not violated Section 5.3(b)(i)) if the MUSA Board
          receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on
          customary terms no less favorable to MUSA than the Confidentiality
          Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2005, between MUSA and an affiliate
          of Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); or (B) recommending such
          an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the MUSA
          Stockholders, if and only to the extent that, (1) in each such case
          referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, (I) the MUSA Board


                                      -38-


<PAGE>


          determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
          that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply
          with their fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws, and (II) such
          Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by MUSA, any subsidiary thereof
          or any officer, director, employee, agent or Representative of any of
          the foregoing acting on behalf of or at the direction of MUSA or any
          of its subsidiaries and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
          Section 5.3(b); (2) in the case of clause (A) above, the MUSA Board
          determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
          and outside financial advisors that it is reasonably likely to result
          in a Superior Proposal; and (3) in the case of clause (B) above, (I)
          the MUSA Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
          constitutes a Superior Proposal, (II) Parent shall have received
          written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") of MUSA's intention to
          take the action referred to in clause (B) at least four business days
          prior to the taking of such action by MUSA, and (III) during such four
          business day period (the "Waiting Period") MUSA and its advisors shall
          have negotiated in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub to make
          adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the MUSA
          Board fully considers any such adjustment and nonetheless concludes in
          good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
          Proposal. If the MUSA Board recommends an unsolicited bona fide
          written Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clause (B) above, Parent
          shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
          7.4(a) of this Agreement.

               (iv) Except as permitted by Section 1.6(c) or Section
          5.3(b)(iii), neither the MUSA Board nor any committee thereof shall
          (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
          modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of the
          Agreement, the Merger, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
          the MUSA Board Recommendation or take any action or make any statement
          in connection with the MUSA Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with
          such approval or MUSA Board Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in
          the MUSA Board Recommendation"), or (ii) approve or recommend, or
          propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.
          For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the MUSA Board
          Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public
          proposal to approve or recommend) by the MUSA Board of an Acquisition
          Proposal, or any failure by the MUSA Board to recommend against an
          Acquisition Proposal in any case where the MUSA Board is required by
          Applicable Laws to make a recommendation or otherwise make a statement
          with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, it being agreed that if an
          Acquisition Proposal has become publicly known, the MUSA Board will
          make such a statement as promptly as practicable (having had a
          reasonable opportunity to consider promptly such Acquisition Proposal)
          in accordance with Applicable Laws, and the failure by MUSA within
          such reasonable time period to reaffirm the MUSA Board Recommendation
          shall be deemed to be a Change in the MUSA Board Recommendation.

               (v) MUSA agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
          terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
          any Person (other than the parties hereto) conducted heretofore with
          respect to any Acquisition Proposal. MUSA agrees that it will take the
          necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities
          referred to in the first sentence of Section 5.3(b)(i) of the
          obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3(b). MUSA also agrees
          promptly, but in any event, within five days


                                      -39-


<PAGE>


          after the date of this Agreement, to request the return or destruction
          of all information and materials provided prior to the date of this
          Agreement by it, its subsidiaries or their respective officers,
          directors, employees, agents or Representatives with respect to the
          consideration or making of any Acquisition Proposal.

               (vi) From and after the execution of this Agreement, MUSA shall
          promptly orally notify Parent of any request for information or any
          inquiries, proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
          indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person
          making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms
          and conditions of any proposals or offers and MUSA shall provide to
          Parent written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 24
          hours of such event, as well as a copy of any such request, inquiry,
          proposal or offer to the extent in writing. MUSA shall keep Parent
          informed orally on a current basis of the status of any Acquisition
          Proposal, including with respect to the status and terms of any such
          proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been
          withdrawn or rejected and MUSA shall provide to Parent prompt written
          notice of any such developments within 24 hours. MUSA also agrees to
          provide any information to Parent that it is providing to another
          Person pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) at the same time it provides
          such information to such other Person.

               (vii) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
          violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(b) by any
          officer, director or (subject to the proviso below) employee of MUSA
          or any of its subsidiaries or any agent or Representative of MUSA or
          any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to
          act on behalf of MUSA or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise, shall
          be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3(b) by MUSA; provided,
          however, that with respect to any such violation by an employee of
          MUSA or any of its subsidiaries, such violation shall not be deemed to
          be a breach of this Section 5.3(b) by MUSA unless such violation,
          directly or indirectly, results in, or is reasonably likely to result
          in, the submission of an Acquisition Proposal by any Person other than
          Parent or Merger Sub.

               (viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
          this Agreement shall be submitted to the MUSA Stockholders for the
          purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger,
          regardless of the recommendation or any change in the recommendation
          of the MUSA Board with respect thereto, unless this Agreement has been
          validly terminated in accordance with Article VII.

               (ix) For purposes of this Agreement:

               (A) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with
          respect to (1) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
          consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
          liquidation or similar transaction involving MUSA, (2) any purchase of
          an equity interest (including by means of a tender or exchange offer)
          representing an amount equal to or greater than a 25% voting or
          economic interest in MUSA, or (3) any purchase of assets, securities
          or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater than
          25% of the consolidated assets of MUSA and its subsidiaries taken as a
          whole (including stock of the subsidiaries of MUSA).


                                      -40-


<PAGE>


               (B) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition
          Proposal (except that (i) references in the definition of "Acquisition
          Proposal" to "25%" shall be replaced by "100%" and (ii) such
          Acquisition Proposal may include a transaction proposed to be
          consummated in two related steps, provided that such Person shall be
          required by the terms of the related acquisition agreement to complete
          both such steps) made by a Person other than a party hereto that is on
          terms that the MUSA Board (after consultation with its outside
          financial advisor and outside counsel) in good faith concludes, taking
          into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
          proposal, the likelihood of obtaining financing, the likely
          consummation date of the transaction contemplated by the proposal, and
          the Person making the proposal, would, if consummated, result in a
          transaction more favorable to the MUSA Stockholders from a financial
          point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
          taking into account any change in the transaction proposed by Parent
          within the Waiting Period (or any successive Waiting Period).

          (c) Third Party Standstill Agreements. During the period from and
after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, MUSA shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (other than any
involving Parent or its subsidiaries). During such period, MUSA agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Laws, the provisions of any such agreements.

          (d) Access.

               (i) During the period from and after the date hereof until the
          earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
          pursuant to Article VII, and subject to Applicable Laws and the
          Confidentiality Agreement, MUSA shall (A) give Parent, its counsel,
          financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
          reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
          notice to the offices, properties, books and records of MUSA and its
          subsidiaries (including, without limitation, all documentation with
          respect to all required Environmental Permits of MUSA and its
          subsidiaries and access to any offices, properties, books, records and
          any other information reasonably requested by Parent regarding the
          compliance by MUSA and its subsidiaries with occupational safety and
          health laws and regulations), (B) furnish to Parent, its counsel,
          financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to
          the extent reasonably available such financial and operating data and
          other information as such Persons may reasonably request (including,
          to the extent reasonably practicable, furnishing to Parent MUSA's
          financial results in advance of filing any MUSA SEC Documents
          containing such financial results), (C) instruct the employees,
          counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
          representatives of MUSA and its subsidiaries to cooperate in all
          reasonable respects with Parent in its investigation of MUSA and its
          subsidiaries and (D) promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of
          any fact or circumstance reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
          Effect on MUSA; provided that information provided to Parent and its
          representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i) shall be subject to
          the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, further, that (1) any
          investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i) shall be conducted in
          such manner


                                      -41-


<PAGE>


          as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
          MUSA and its subsidiaries; (2) neither MUSA nor any of its
          subsidiaries shall be required to prepare special records, reports,
          analyses or other information that they do not prepare in the ordinary
          course of business, unless such preparation would not impose an
          unreasonable burden; and (3) neither MUSA nor any of its subsidiaries
          shall be required to take any action that would constitute a waiver of
          the attorney-client privilege. No information or knowledge obtained by
          Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i) shall
          affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
          MUSA hereunder.

               (ii) During the period from and after the date hereof until the
          earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
          pursuant to Article VII, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
          MUSA shall cooperate with Parent and its representatives to permit
          Parent and its representatives to conduct a full review of all claims
          asserted by or against MUSA, any of its subsidiaries or any of their
          respective directors, officers or employees in litigation or
          threatened litigation, including by giving Parent and its
          representatives, at Parent's discretion and upon Parent's reasonable
          notice, access to MUSA's (or any subsidiary's) personnel, books and
          records (including, but not limited to, electronic communications),
          counsel (including, without limitation, records or reports of
          counsel), and other pertinent information deemed necessary by Parent
          to assess any such claims; provided, however, that to the extent that
          any portion of the information requested by Parent or its
          representatives from MUSA's counsel is subject to the attorney-client
          privilege, such portion may be withheld from Parent and its
          representatives unless Parent agrees to enter into a customary joint
          defense or similar agreement.

          (e) Financing Assistance. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, MUSA and its subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
advisors, attorneys, accountants and representatives to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (or the arrangement of the alternative financing, if any, contemplated
by Section 5.2(b)), including (i) using reasonable best efforts to (A) cause
appropriate officers and employees to be available, on a customary basis and on
reasonable advance notice, to meet with prospective lenders and investors in
meetings, presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions, (B) assist with
the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith, (C) cause its
independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent, including
providing consent to Parent to prepare and use their audit reports and SAS 100
reviews relating to MUSA and its subsidiaries and to provide any necessary
"comfort letters" and (D) cause its attorneys to provide reasonable assistance
to Parent, including to provide any necessary and customary legal opinions and
(ii) executing and delivering any commitment letters, underwriting or placement
agreements, registration statements, pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, or other requested certificates or documents,
including allowing for a certificate of the chief financial officer of MUSA with
respect to solvency or other matters; provided that none of the letters,
agreements, registration statements, documents and certificates referenced in
clause (ii) above shall be executed and delivered except in connection with the
Closing (and the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing); and provided, further, that MUSA shall not be required to
provide any such assistance which would interfere unreasonably and materially
with the business or


                                      -42-


<PAGE>


operations of MUSA and its subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly, upon request by
MUSA, reimburse MUSA for all reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs incurred
by MUSA or any of its subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation.

          (f) Expense Certificates. No later than two business days prior to the
Closing Date, MUSA shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent (i) a
certificate duly executed by an authorized officer on behalf of MUSA setting
forth in detail the true and accurate total of Transaction Fees, and (ii) backup
confirmation of such calculation, including statements or certificates from each
law firm, accounting firm and investment bank to which fees and expenses have
been paid or will be payable by MUSA or its subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, setting forth the
aggregate amount of all such fees and expenses, and acknowledging that no
further amounts (other than amounts reasonably estimated through the Closing)
will be due from MUSA or its subsidiaries in connection herewith and therewith
providing the Closing shall occur. After the date hereof, MUSA agrees to consult
and cooperate with Parent to the extent that actual Transaction Fees become
likely to exceed the estimate provided pursuant to Section 4.6, in an effort to
minimize such expenses to the extent reasonably practicable.

          (g) Consents Cooperation. MUSA shall keep Parent informed, and shall
consult with Parent in advance, in connection with any action it or any of its
subsidiaries take in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals
required as a condition to the Closing pursuant to Section 6.2(g).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any contract,
agreement or other instrument for which a consent or approval is required
pursuant to Section 6.2(g), in no event shall MUSA or any of its subsidiaries be
permitted, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), to incur or agree to incur any costs, expenses or
other liabilities in connection with obtaining any such consent or approval,
except for incidental administrative and legal costs or similar such costs
required to be paid pursuant to such contract, agreement or instrument. Parent
and MUSA shall cooperate with each other and use their good faith efforts to
agree upon a course of action with respect to obtaining such consents or
approvals. MUSA agrees to act in good faith with respect to obtaining the
consents required by Section 6.2(g) in order to limit the amount of any such
costs. Parent and MUSA shall work together, taking into account relevant legal
advice as well as their good faith business judgment, in considering the proper
course of action with respect to the consents or approvals required by Section
6.2(g), which actions may include agreeing not to seek such a consent based on
applicable requirements or other considerations (in which event such consent
shall not be required to be obtained in order to satisfy the condition set forth
in Section 6.2(g)).

          (a) The representations and warranties set forth in:

               (i) Article IV (other than in the case of the representations and

shall have been obtained.

remain in full force and effect as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
a termination of the Employment Agreement or a failure of the Employment
Agreement to remain in full force and effect as of the Closing Date shall not be
deemed to be a failure of the condition set forth in this Section 6.2(e) if such
termination or failure to remain in full force and effect is solely a result of
(i) Lourenco Goncalves being unable to perform his duties thereunder due to his
death or Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement), (ii) Lourenco
Goncalves's termination thereunder "without Cause" (as defined in the Employment
Agreement) or "without Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or
(iii) a commission of an act by Lourenco Goncalves which would not have

Common Stock shall have demanded and validly perfected appraisal of their MUSA

the other agreements, contracts or other instruments to which MUSA or any of its
subsidiaries is a party (or by which it or any of its respective properties or

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been received by
MUSA (and no such consent or approval shall have been revoked), except for such
consents or approvals (A) which are listed in Section 4.5(b) of the MUSA
Disclosure Schedules or (B) the failure of which to obtain and not be revoked
would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the
operation of the business of Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries from and
after the Closing nor result in any material liability.

          (h) Since the date of this Agreement, there has not been any Material
Adverse Effect on MUSA or any event, change, effect or development that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on MUSA.

          6.3. Conditions to Obligation of MUSA. The obligation of MUSA to
consummate the Merger shall also be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by
MUSA at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

          Parent or Merger Sub.

               (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed and complied with
          all of their respective covenants hereunder in all material respects

          connection with a termination pursuant to Section 7.2(b), on or prior
          to the MUSA Stockholders Meeting) any Person (other than Parent) shall
          have made and not withdrawn (or publicly disclosed its intention to
          make) an Acquisition Proposal (substituting 50.1% for the 25%
          threshold set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, a
          "Covered Proposal"), and (C) within 12 months (or, solely with respect
          to a termination pursuant to Section 7.2(a), 9 months) of termination
          of this Agreement, MUSA enters into an agreement with respect to a
          Covered Proposal;

               (ii) This Agreement shall be terminated after Parent shall have
          become entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a)
          (whether or not Parent immediately terminates this Agreement or the
          Agreement is subsequently terminated pursuant to any other provision
          under this Article VII); or

               (iii) MUSA shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to

shall be paid (A) in the case of Section 7.6(a)(i), not later than immediately
prior to the time and the date on which MUSA enters into an agreement with
respect to a Covered Proposal (provided, however, that if such Covered Proposal
was not outstanding at the time of the termination and the Person or Persons
making such Covered Proposal had not previously made a Covered Proposal, then
the Termination Fee shall be paid upon consummation of the transaction
contemplated by such agreement), (B) in the case of Section 7.6(a)(ii), on the
date that this Agreement is terminated (and immediately prior to such
termination in the case of a termination by MUSA), and (C) in the case of
Section 7.6(a)(iii), immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, in
each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

          (b) Upon the termination of this Agreement:

               (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4;

               (ii) by Parent or MUSA pursuant to Section 7.2(a) if on or prior
          to the time of such termination pursuant to Section 7.2(a) any Person
          (other than Parent) shall have made and not withdrawn (or publicly
          disclosed its intention to make) a Covered Proposal;

               (iii) by Parent or MUSA pursuant to Section 7.2(b); or

               (iv) by MUSA pursuant to Section 7.3(b),

Agreement, and the negotiation of the related agreements, up to a maximum amount

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
negotiation of the related agreements, up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000,
payable by wire transfer of same day funds on the date of termination of this
Agreement. MUSA shall provide to Parent reasonable documentation of such charges
and expenses upon the request of Parent.

          (d) The parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party hereto obligated to make a
payment under this Section 7.6 (the "Paying Party") fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.6, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party hereto (the "Receiving Party") commences a suit that results in
a judgment against the Paying Party for the fees set forth in this Section 7.6
or any portion of such fees, the Paying Party shall pay to the Receiving Party
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fees at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date
of payment.

          (e) Except as specifically provided in this Section 7.6, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such
expenses, except (i) filing fees incurred in connection with Commission filings
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
printing and mailing costs related thereto, all of which shall be shared equally
by Parent and MUSA; and (ii) filing fees incurred in connection with Federal
Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice filings relating to
the HSR Act and appropriate Governmental Authorities relating to applicable
Foreign Antitrust Laws (if any), which shall be borne by Parent and Merger Sub.

except that it shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

or implied, is intended or shall be construed to create any third-party
beneficiaries.

          8.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in

          8.8. Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; Jury Trial.

          (a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the parties
hereto irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such Action may be heard
and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of
any summons and complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to
the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party hereto. Nothing in this Section 8.8 shall
affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

          (c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS MERGER AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.8.

          8.9. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that Parent
shall be permitted to assign this Agreement and any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, in connection
with the conversion of Parent from a corporation to a limited liability company)
without the prior written consent of any party hereto so long as (a) such
assignee or successor shall be an affiliate of Apollo Management V, L.P. and (b)
Parent's rights, interests and obligations under each of the Financing
Agreements are assigned to such assignee or successor at or prior to the time of
the assignment hereunder (it being understood and agreed by each of the parties
hereto that such assignment or conversion shall not be deemed to be a breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III, shall not be deemed to result in any such representation or
warranty becoming untrue or inaccurate and shall not be deemed to be a breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement contained herein). Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

          8.10. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the MUSA Stockholders;
provided, however, that, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made
that by law requires further approval by the MUSA Stockholders without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

          8.11. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.10, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights and the single or partial exercise of any
rights hereof shall not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

          8.12. No Presumption Against Drafter. Each of the parties hereto has
jointly participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event of an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by each of the parties hereto
and no presumptions or burdens of proof shall arise favoring any party hereto by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

          8.13. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.
