ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company (other than any
shares converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)(ii)_). From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of
Subsidiary-Owned Stock_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub
shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Company such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the
Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the
ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.02_ and
_2.03_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted
into shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_,
Company Restricted Shares to be converted to cash in accordance with _Section
2.04_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
$24.25 in cash, without interest, and (ii) the Additional Consideration, if
any (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (or evidence of shares in book-entry

 



      
 

 



 

form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.02_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing (but without limiting the restrictions set forth in _Section
6.01(a)_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. As provided in _Section 2.02(h)_, the right of
any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall
be subject to and reduced by the amount of any required withholding under
applicable Tax Law.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund; Deliverables_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for
payment in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. All such cash deposited
with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

 



 

(b) _Transmittal Materials_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within four Business Days after the Effective
Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise provide in
the case of book-entry shares, to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the
Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_, Company Restricted
Shares to be converted to cash in accordance with _Section 2.04_ and
Dissenting Shares): (i) transmittal materials, including a form of letter of
transmittal in such form and with such other provisions as Parent may specify,
subject to the Companys reasonable approval, and which shall be prepared
prior to Closing (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass (A) with
respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, only upon delivery to the Paying
Agent of a duly, completely and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.02(i)_) and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request and (B) with respect to book-entry shares, only upon
delivery to the Paying Agent of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry
transfer of book-entry shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer
as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of book-entry shares or Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.02(i)_) to the
Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which
such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.01_.

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender

 



      
 

 



 

of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in _Section 2.02(i)_) together
with the Letter of Transmittal duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer
as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), in each case together with such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common
Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.02(c)_, each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate
with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock are entitled
to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.01_. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company Common Stock
held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any

 



      
 

 



 

portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) for
two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the Payment Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property
of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of,
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any stockholder of the Company to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent
there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms
hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration or any other payments otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under applicable Tax Law or any other applicable Law. Amounts
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 



 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.03 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder
who has properly exercised such stockholders appraisal rights in respect of
such shares (any such shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_
") under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_ and
instead shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to timely perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholders right to
dissent from the Merger under the DGCL, in which case such stockholder shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Sections
2.01_ and _2.02_ , without interest thereon, in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares) and to

 



      
 

 



 

receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The
Company (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any notice or demand
for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock (or threats
thereof) and any withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands or
threats received by the Company, (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands and (iii) shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent
or as otherwise required by a final, non-appealable order of a Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration,
the amount payable for such Company Stock Option shall be $0.00.

 



 

(b) _Company SARs_. At the Effective Time, each Company SAR, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable base
price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the base price per share of Company Common
Stock equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the amount payable for such
Company SAR shall be $0.00.

 



 

(c) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each unvested Company
Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, without

a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(e) _Director DCP_. For any members of the Board of Directors of the Company
(the " _Company Board_ ") who elected to have amounts deferred under the
Director DCP deemed invested in Company Common Stock, (i) each share of
Company Common Stock purchased by the Company and held as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time in connection with such deferrals
shall be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ hereof, and (ii) each
such director shall be entitled to receive therefore a cash payment, without
interest, in an

 



      
 

 



 

amount equal to the Merger Consideration, subject to and payable in accordance
with the terms of the Director DCP.

 



 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
any actions which are necessary to approve and effectuate the provisions of
_Section 2.04(a)_ through _Section 2.04(e)_, including (i) making any
determinations or adopting resolutions of the Company Board or the applicable
committee thereof as may be necessary, (ii) taking any actions, including
obtaining any required consent from the holder of a compensatory equity award,
necessary so that each Company Stock Option with an exercise price that
exceeds the Merger Consideration and each Company SAR with a base price that
exceeds the Merger Consideration is canceled for no additional consideration
and (iii) satisfying any requirement to notify the holders of compensatory
equity awards as may be required under the Company Stock Plans.

 



 

(g) _Payment with Respect to Stock-Based Awards_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall pay the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section 2.04_, without any interest thereon, and shall pay all such amounts
payable to employees through its payroll systems net of applicable withholding
Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any such amounts that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code,
the Surviving Company shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not
trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

SECTION 2.05 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate (the " _FIRPTA
Certificate_ "), dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing
Date, certifying that (A) the Company is not and in the preceding five-year
period has never been a "United States real property holding corporation" as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and (B) none of the Equity Interests in the Company
constitute a "United States real property interest" as defined in Section
897(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, which
certificate shall be in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
provided, however, that if the Company fails to provide the FIRPTA
Certificate, the transaction shall nonetheless close and Parent shall withhold
from the Merger Consideration and pay over to the appropriate taxing
authorities the amount required to be withheld under Section 1445 of the Code
as reasonably determined by Parent.

Letter relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

SECTION 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of the Companys Subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries that are not "Significant Subsidiaries" (as such term is
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), where the failure to be so
organized, exist or be in good standing, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals
(collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to
have such power or authority or to possess Company Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, is not material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has delivered or made available to

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ "), the amended and
restated by-laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Company By-laws_ ") and each Company Subsidiarys certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational documents, in each case, as
amended through the date hereof.

 



 

SECTION 4.02 _Company Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by a
Company Subsidiary or by the Company and a Company Subsidiary, free and clear
of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, deeds of trust, rights of first
offer or first refusal, options, encumbrances, any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests) and any
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, with
covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, encroachments, title retention
agreements or other third party rights or title defect of any kind or nature
whatsoever, " _Liens_ "), except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities Laws and except as set forth in _Section 4.02(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. _Section 4.02(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the
Company Subsidiaries, each such Company Subsidiarys jurisdiction of
organization and the class, number and percentage of its authorized, issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests, if any, that are not owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or voting securities of,
or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company,
limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity.

of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the

2016 and in accordance with their terms in effect at such time.

 



 

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and, at the time of
issuance, all such shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Company
Stock Options and Company SARs will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to, or issued in violation of, any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the
Company Charter, the Company By-laws or any contract, lease, sublease,
license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, understanding, undertaking,
concession, franchise or other instrument (in each case, whether in writing or
oral, to the extent legally binding on the parties thereto) (a " _Contract_ ")
to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. All grants of equity
awards or other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to
current or former directors, officers, employees, agents or consultants of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary have been made in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder and any

any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, (x) any capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any securities
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (y) any warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any other obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or other
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are linked in any
way to the price of any Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock
or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any Company Subsidiary,
the value of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any part of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions declared or
paid on any shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.03(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are not any
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants, calls, options or other
rights referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding
sentence. With respect to Company Stock Options, (1) each grant of a Company
Stock Option was duly authorized on the date on which the grant of such
Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Date_ ") for such option by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof), and (2) the per share exercise
price of each Company Stock Option was at least equal to the fair market value
of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date. There are no
debentures, bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote (" _Company Voting Debt_ "). Other than the Voting
Agreement, there are no voting agreements with respect to the voting of any
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the
Company. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to
any agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or
nominate any director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 4.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject,
in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at
the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The
Company Board has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote of the directors
present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of the Company
was present, (i) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) declaring this Agreement

Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL). The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity.

 



 

(b) The Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the restrictions on "business combinations"
(as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the
DGCL. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation (collectively, "
_Takeover Laws_ ") applies with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no
stockholder rights plan, "poison pill," antitakeover plan or similar device in
effect to which the Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

Letter, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to
make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any
loss of a material benefit under, require a consent or waiver under, require
the payment of a penalty or change of control payment under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company Charter, the
Company By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary (assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained), (ii) any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or

Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets
(assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval, clearance, waiver, Permit or order (" _Consent_ ")
of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made to or with any
federal, national, state, provincial or local, whether domestic or foreign,
government or any court of competent jurisdiction, tribunal, judicial body,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental or regulatory
authority or instrumentality, whether domestic, foreign or supranational (a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the

hereunder or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than (i) (A) the filing with the SEC of
the Proxy Statement in preliminary and definitive form, and (B) the filing

State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
the other jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business, (iv)
such filings with and approvals of the NYSE as are required to permit the
consummation of the Merger, (v) the CFIUS Notice, (vi) the ICA Clearance and

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

class or series of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys capital stock or
other securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement.

Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and Company Permits that are material to the

Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened alleging
that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not in compliance with any
applicable Law or Company Permit or which challenges or questions the validity
of any rights of the holder of any Company Permit, in each case that are
material to the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
presently conducted. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received any written notice or other communication from any Governmental
Entity regarding any actual or alleged failure to comply with, or any
violation of, any Law in a material respect.

 



 

SECTION 4.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be

Proxy Statement will, as of any date it is filed or amended, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. No representation is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

Effect. From October 1, 2016 to the date of this Agreement, each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has conducted its respective business in

of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and

or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such
filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC or its staff in respect of the Company
SEC Documents. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
(including all related notes or schedules) included in the Company SEC
Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,
in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the periods
shown (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments that are not material).

have been incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2016 and (iv) for liabilities and obligations

have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise).

 



 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer

made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate as of the date of such certifications. None of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX. Since October 1, 2014, subject to any applicable grace
periods, the Company and each of its officers and directors have been and are

and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet

Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

nor any Company Subsidiary has received any complaint, allegation, assertion

Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, nor,
to Parents Knowledge, any other party thereto, under any term or condition of
the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) to Parents
Knowledge, constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
or other contingency set forth in the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting
Agreement, or (iii) to Parents Knowledge, otherwise result in any portion of
the Financing being unavailable on or before the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions relating to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Documents and the
Underwriting Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe
any of the conditions relating to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing set forth in the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement
will not be satisfied or the Financing will not be consummated and available
in full on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees, underwriting fees or other fees required by the Commitment
Documents or the Underwriting Agreement to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as they become due.

 



 

SECTION 5.08 _Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and at and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent. Since its date
of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor conducted any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

 



 

SECTION 5.09 _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has been, at any
time during the three years prior to the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. As of the
date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates owns any shares of capital stock of the Company or has any rights
to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company (except pursuant to this
Agreement).

 



 

SECTION 5.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_ or in any
certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent makes

 



      
 

 



 

any other express or implied representation or warranty in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.02 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.02(b)_ and _Section
6.02(d)_, the Company agrees that it shall, and it shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, and that it shall direct, and use reasonable best
efforts to cause, its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, agents and other
representatives of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (such directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors, agents and other representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_
"), to: (i) immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Alternative Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), any Alternative
Proposal or any proposal that could be reasonably expected to result in an
Alternative Proposal; (ii) promptly request the return or destruction (to the
extent provided for by the applicable confidentiality agreement) of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person (other than
Parent) that has, within the one **-** year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, made or indicated an intention to make, or engaged in diligence or
substantive discussions with respect to, an Alternative Proposal; (iii)
immediately cease access to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives and the Company and its Representatives) to
any electronic data room maintained by the Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Alternative Proposal; and
(iv) not, and not publicly announce any intention to, directly or indirectly,
(A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any Inquiry
or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, (B) furnish information to or
afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any
Person that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or in connection with, an
Inquiry or an Alternative Proposal, (C) enter into, continue or maintain
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Inquiry or an
Alternative Proposal, (D) participate in or knowingly facilitate any
discussions or negotiations (other than informing Persons of the provisions
set forth in this _Section 6.02_, solely in response to a bona fide
unsolicited Inquiry after the date hereof) regarding, or furnish or cause to
be furnished to any Person or "Group" (as such term is defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) any information with respect to the Company, or
take any other action to facilitate any Inquiry, (E) approve, agree to,
accept, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, (F) submit to a vote of
its stockholders, approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, (G)
grant any waiver, amendment or release under any state antitakeover statute,
(H) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or
of which it is a beneficiary and shall enforce any such provisions (provided
that the Company shall not be required to enforce, and shall be permitted to
waive, any provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being
made to the Company Board on a confidential basis to the extent that the
Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel), that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (provided that the Company shall promptly notify Parent
after the Company Board makes such determination)), (I) effect any Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (J) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in
principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except

 



      
 

 



 

for confidentiality agreements permitted under _Section 6.02(b)_). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.02(a)_ (including any direction hereunder) by
any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.02(a)_ by the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.02(a)_, if the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives a written Alternative Proposal that was unsolicited
after the date hereof by any Person or "Group" at any time prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval that did not result from or arise in connection
with a breach of _Section 6.02(a)_, the Company and its Representatives may,
prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, take the
actions set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of this _Section 6.02(b)_ if
the Company Board (including any duly authorized committee thereof) has
determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (i) obtain from such
Person or "Group" an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at
least as restrictive in all material respects with respect to such Person or
"Group" as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are with respect to
Parent (it being agreed that such confidentiality agreement shall include a
standstill agreement but may permit submission of non-public, private
proposals to the Company Board) and, (ii) following the entry into such
confidentiality agreement, furnish information to such Person or "Group,"
enter into discussions and negotiations with such Person or "Group" with
respect to such Alternative Proposal and afford access to the business,
employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in response to such Alternative Proposal.

 



 

(c) Promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four hours) following receipt
of any Alternative Proposal or any Inquiry, the Company shall advise Parent in
writing (including by email in accordance with _Section 9.07_) of the receipt
of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the
Person or "Group" making any such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry), and the
Company shall as promptly as practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of such
Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of
the material terms of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if oral. The
Company agrees that it shall provide to Parent (on a substantially
simultaneous basis) any non-public information concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that may be provided (pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_) to
any other Person or "Group" in connection with any Alternative Proposal or
Inquiry that has not previously been provided to Parent. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable with notice setting
forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed
on a current basis in all material respects of all material communications
regarding such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including material amendments
or proposed material amendments thereto (including all pricing changes)).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may (i) solely upon the
occurrence of an Intervening Event or in the event that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal (after

 



      
 

 



 

taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.02(d)_), withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or
release inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any of the foregoing
being an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, recommending against the Merger or approving, endorsing or recommending
any Alternative Proposal) and (ii) if the Company has received a Superior
Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 6.02(d)_), terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may
not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_, unless:

 



 

(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with this _Section
6.02_;

 



 

(ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Parent, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of
such Superior Proposal and all other material transaction agreements and other
material documents relating to such Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy
is available, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal), or, in cases involving an Intervening Event, of the
circumstances giving rise to the Adverse Recommendation Change;

 



 

(iii) during the Notice Period, the Company has and has caused its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the
Company Board after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) a Superior Proposal, or in cases involving an
Intervening Event, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change (in
the judgment of the Company Board after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would no longer be inconsistent
with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
and

 



 

(iv) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, and after consultation with
the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or,
in cases involving an Intervening Event, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.02(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence,
references to the three Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two Business Day period.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company Board
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with _Section 6.02(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, any public
disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen" statement) by the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or the Company Board relating to any determination or
other action by the Company Board or the Company with respect to any
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a factually
accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Agreement with respect thereto
(in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the Company
Recommendation) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change; it being understood that any disclosure contemplated by
the foregoing relating to an Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board indicates that it has
not changed the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

 



 

(f) If (i) any public announcement regarding an Alternative Proposal is made
by any of the Companys Representatives or by the Person making such
Alternative Proposal, (ii) within three Business Days following such public
announcement, Parent delivers to the Company in writing a request that the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation (which
such request may be made by Parent only once with respect to such Alternative
Proposal, unless any revisions are made to such Alternative Proposal in which
case an additional request may be made by Parent once with respect to each
such revised Alternative Proposal), and (iii) the Company Board does not
expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation during the period of
three Business Days following the delivery to the Company of such request,
then the Company shall be deemed to have made an Adverse Recommendation Change
at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of such period of three
Business Days.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company which would result in any Person or "Group" beneficially owning 20% or
more of the outstanding equity interests of the Company or any successor or
parent company thereto; (B) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition,
directly or indirectly (including by way

 



      
 

 



 

of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise), of any business or assets of the

securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company; or (E) any combination of the
foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

 



 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event, development, occurrence,
effect, condition or change affecting the Company that was not known or
reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability
or magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably

determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a

 _Additional Agreements_

 



 

SECTION 7.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders
Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event on or before the date that is fifteen Business Days after
the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
a proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to
the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent and the Company shall cooperate
and consult with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent
shall furnish all information concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the
Company, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide the other with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and Parent will cooperate in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)
shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement or response (including the proposed preliminary and final versions
of the Proxy Statement or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file or mail such
document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Company shall cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the
SEC or other Governmental Entities under this _Section 7.01(a)_ to comply in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(b) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement,
Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the Companys prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Companys stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 7.01(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 7.01(a)_.

 



 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement,
which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly

 



      
 

 



 

notify Parent of such event, and the Company shall promptly file any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC and, as required
by Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement
to the Companys stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall limit
the obligations of any party under _Section 7.01(a)_.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC clears
the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of (i) seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the
applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a
proposal to the Companys stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to
approve certain compensation that may become payable to the Companys "named
executive officers" as determined under Regulation S-K in connection with the
completion of the Merger. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall
(A) as reasonably promptly as practicable after the date on which the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders (and in no event
more than five Business Days after the date on which the SEC confirms that it
has no further comments on the Proxy Statement); and (B) subject to _Section
6.02(d)_, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
possible after the twentieth Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in each case, except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 6.02(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 7.01(d)_, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall,
upon the request of Parent (and only with the prior written consent of
Parent), make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than twenty days after
the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). Once
the Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and, to the
extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent
the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_ or the Expense
Reimbursement in accordance with _Section 8.03(d)_, (i) its obligations to
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 7.01_ shall
not be affected by the making of an Adverse Recommendation Change by the
Company Board and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.01_ shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any

 



       
 

 



 

Alternative Proposal. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms and, to the extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the
Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
8.03(b) _or the Expense Reimbursement in accordance with _Section 8.03(d)_,
the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the Companys
stockholders any Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

 



 

SECTION 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access, upon reasonable
advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not publicly
available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws or commission actions and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request, including all information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that is required by the Australian Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the listing rules
of the ASX and all regulatory guides of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission applicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer) (in each case, in a manner so as to
not interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure,
to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such disclosure or access alone  or taken together with other
competitively sensitive information Company has made or will make available to
Parent  would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party (provided that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or (B) otherwise
provide the information in a manner that does not require such consent), (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
(or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege), or (iii) violate, or would reasonably be expected
to violate, any Law (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does
not violate Law). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
proviso to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the
general nature of what is being withheld. Without limiting the obligations set
forth in _Section 7.07_ of this Agreement, all information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 7.02_ shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of August 18, 2016, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may,
following prior notice and consultation with the Company, disclose to
potential purchasers of any of the Companys or Parents or their respective
Subsidiaries businesses or other assets in connection with any divestiture
obligations and any representatives of such potential purchasers, such
confidential information reasonably related to such businesses or assets to be
divested pursuant to Section 7.03(f), subject, to the extent necessary or
reasonably advisable, to appropriate "clean room" arrangements.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 7.03 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, including this _Section 7.03_, each of the
parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable.

 



 

(b) _Filings and Consents_. Parent and the Company shall (i) file as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days of the execution of
this Agreement, unless a later time is mutually agreed by the parties) with
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the notification
and report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) promptly (and not later than 20 business
days after the date hereof, unless otherwise agreed by the parties) work
cooperatively together to prepare and file a draft CFIUS Notice in accordance
with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 and customary practice, and promptly file a final
CFIUS Notice in connection with the CFIUS Clearance and in accordance with 31
C.F.R. Part 800 after receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no comment on the
draft CFIUS Notice, and timely provide any information requested by CFIUS or
any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection with CFIUS
review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) promptly assemble and provide the information necessary for Parent to,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and not later than 20
Business Days after the filing of a final CFIUS Notice), prepare and make or
cause to be made a notification under Part III of the ICA with the Investment
Review Division of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (the "
_IRD_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and timely
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the IRD or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
notification or any review initiated under the ICA and (iv) as promptly as
practicable and advisable, after the date of this Agreement, use reasonable
best efforts to prepare and submit all other filings, notifications,
information updates and other presentations required by or in connection with
seeking, and use reasonable best efforts to obtain, all Consents, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, non-actions, exemptions, change of
ownership approvals or other authorizations from any Governmental Entity or
other third party (the " _Authorizations_ "), in each case that are reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to assist and cooperate with
the other party in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , that Parent and
the Company shall have no obligation to pay any fee to any third party for the
purpose of obtaining any such Authorization, or pay any costs and expenses of
any third party resulting from the process of obtaining such Authorization
(without limiting Parents obligations under _Section 7.03(f)_), except to
the extent that either party is required by law to pay any filing fees due to
any Government Entities reviewing the transaction.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of Parent. Subject to
_Section 7.06_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other and their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform the other party,
or its counsel, upon receipt of any substantive communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity or such private party, in each case,
regarding any such filing, submission, proceeding or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) permit the other party or its counsel to review and
discuss reasonably in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party or its counsel in connection with, any proposed substantive
communication to be given by it to CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by such private party, any other person; and (iv) to the extent not
prohibited by CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or such other
Governmental Entity, give the other party or its counsel reasonable advance
notice of any in-person meeting, and any conference call that is initiated by
such party or scheduled in advance, with such Governmental Entity or such
private party and not participate independently therein without first giving
the other party or its counsel reasonable opportunity to attend and
participate therein or, in the event such other party or its counsel does not
attend or participate therein, consulting with such other party or its counsel
reasonably in advance and considering in good faith the views of such other
party or its counsel in connection therewith. Parent and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 7.03(c)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel (or previously
agreed outside consultant, as applicable) of the recipient and shall not be
disclosed by such outside counsel (or previously agreed outside consultant, as
applicable) to employees, officers or directors of such outside counsels
client unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Materials provided by a party to the other party pursuant to this _Section
7.03(c)_ may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (y) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address
privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(d) _Settlements and Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, with respect to the matters covered in this _Section 7.03_,
it is agreed that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising
and implementing the strategy for obtaining CFIUS Clearance, ICA Clearance and
any necessary antitrust or competition clearances; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall consult in advance with the Company and in good faith take
the Companys views into account regarding the overall strategic direction of
obtaining CFIUS Clearance, ICA Clearance or antitrust or competition clearance
and consult with the Company prior to taking any material substantive position
in any written position, or, to the extent practicable, discussions with any
Governmental Entity. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, make any offer, acceptance or counter-
offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Governmental Entity with respect to any substantive proposed settlement,
consent decree, commitment or remedy, except as specifically requested by or
agreed with Parent. Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall require Parent (or
permit the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of
Parent) to litigate with any Governmental Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Additional Information_. Each of Parent and the Company shall comply, as
early and completely as practicable and advisable, with any request for
additional information, documents or other materials received by such party or
any of its Subsidiaries from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity in relation to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Divestiture Obligations_. Subject to _Section 7.03(g)_, to the extent
necessary in order to obtain the requisite Authorizations of Governmental
Entities, Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if
such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, assignment or disposition
of such assets or businesses of Parent, or effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action
which it is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or
commit to take such action, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid
the commencement of any action by any Governmental Entity to prohibit the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the basis of the Antitrust
Laws, or if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
issued or imposed on the basis of the Antitrust Laws so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event, not later
than the End Date.

 



 

(g) _Caps on Divestitures_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Agreement, including _Section 7.03(f)_, or the "reasonable best
efforts" standard generally, shall require, or be construed to require that
Parent take, or cause to be taken, (i) any action with respect to any of the
assets or businesses of Parent or of the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries that is not conditioned on consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any action that would require Parent to
sell, divest, assign, dispose of or hold separate (or effect any other remedy
requested by a Governmental Entity in respect of) any assets or businesses of
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or agree to, or enter
into any conditions or mitigation agreements or other remedies under Antitrust
Laws, the DPA or the ICA, which would, in the aggregate, represent or cause a
one year loss of EBIT (as measured by 2016 EBIT contribution to the extent
affecting assets set forth on _Section 7.03(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, as set forth under the heading "Reference Number" for the applicable
asset, or to the extent affecting assets not on such schedule, as reasonably
determined by the parties) in excess of $15,000,000 or require divestiture or
licensing of either partys brand or related intellectual property except
where such brand or related intellectual property is exclusively used by the
party in connection with products manufactured entirely at assets or
businesses that are divested pursuant to _Section 7.03(f)_; _provided_ ,
that, in each case, as between Parent and the Company, Parent shall determine
in its sole discretion the assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to be so sold, divested, assigned, disposed
of, held separate or subject to any restriction or limitation.

 



 

(h) _Alternative Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement, during the term of this Agreement neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall cooperate with
any other Person in seeking regulatory clearance of any Alternative Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 7.04 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative
Proposal, Superior Proposal or related matters in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, by court process, or by obligations pursuant to
the requirements of any applicable securities exchange (in which case the
disclosing party shall consult with the other parties in advance of such
disclosure to the extent practicable under the circumstances). The Company and
Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this _Section 7.04_ shall limit the
ability of any party hereto to make additional disclosures that are consistent
in all but _de minimis_ respects with the prior public disclosures regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 7.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will cause the
Company and Company Subsidiaries to provide all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other similar agreements between any Company Indemnified
Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand (to the extent disclosed on _Section 7.05(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter or otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof), in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees
to cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who was prior to or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or
employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees
and disbursements (subject to the limitations described in _Section
7.05(d)_), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, in each
case, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in
each case, to the extent provided by the Company Charter, the Company By-laws
or the comparable charter or organizational documents

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as
applicable, or the terms of any indemnification or other similar agreement
between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (to the extent disclosed on _Section
7.05(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or otherwise made available to
Parent prior to the date hereof), as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
as applicable, and in each case subject to applicable Law. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within
twenty Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company
Indemnified Party of a request therefor, in each case, to the extent provided
by the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, as applicable, or the terms of any indemnification or other
similar agreement between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (to the extent made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof), as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, as applicable; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL or the Surviving Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that
such person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company
and such Company Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other in the
defense of any such matter. _Section 7.05(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all indemnification or other
similar agreements (other than organizational documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand,
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company directly or indirectly assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.05_.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall either (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) cause
to be maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date
hereof (true and correct copies of which that are in effect as of the date of
this Agreement have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement) or provide substitute policies for the Company and its current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either
case, with amounts not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Company be
required to pay (or Parent be required to cause the Surviving Company to pay)
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more
than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company
prior to the date

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement for directors and officers liability insurance (which amount
is set forth in _Section 7.05(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 7.05_ it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within
such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date Parent may
purchase or cause the Company to purchase, at Parents option and expense
(following reasonable consultation with the Company), "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance for a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers insurance
currently maintained by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage
in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ that in no event shall the total cost of any such tail insurance
for the directors and officers liability insurance exceed the Maximum Amount.
In the event that such tail coverage is purchased, the Surviving Company and
Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this
_Section 7.05(c)_. The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect during the period of insurance, and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 7.05(a)_, upon learning of any claim, action, suit or proceeding,
shall notify Parent and the Surviving Company thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Surviving Company of any liability it may have to
such Company Indemnified Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice
the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, Parent or the Surviving Company shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof through counsel (i) with recognized competence and experience
in connection with claims, actions, suits or proceedings of the type involved,
and (ii) reasonably acceptable to the Company Indemnified Parties, and neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to such Company Indemnified
Parties for the expenses of other counsel engaged by such Company Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
pursuant to this _Section 7.05(d)_, (x) the Company Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (y) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.05_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 7.06 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought or threatened against the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, or its or their Representatives, by security holders of the
Company (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of such litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with
respect thereto) and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and control the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting in any way the parties
obligations under _Section 7.03_, the Company shall cooperate, shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its directors, officers and other Representatives to
cooperate in the defense against such Transaction Litigation.

 



 

SECTION 7.07 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to obtain,
or cause to be obtained, (x) the Financing or (y) any other alternative debt
or equity financing (such alternative financing, the " _Alternate Financing_
") including using its reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) (other than
where the Commitment Documents have terminated as a result of the consummation
of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event)
complying with and maintaining in effect the Commitment Documents, including
by complying with any "flex" provisions contained in any fee letter referred
to therein in accordance with the terms thereof and using reasonable best
efforts to ensure the accuracy of all representations and warranties and the
compliance with all covenants and agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries
under the Commitment Documents, and (ii) (other than where the Commitment
Documents have terminated as a result of the consummation of an Alternate
Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing that are within the
control of Parent and its Subsidiaries and by paying when due any fees or
deposits required by the Commitment Documents, the Underwriting Agreement or
any fee letter referred to therein. Other than where the Commitment Documents
have terminated as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or
the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to timely (A) cause the Financing Sources under the
Commitment Documents and the Underwriting Agreement to fully fund the
Financing provided for thereunder and (B) fully enforce its rights under the
Commitment Documents and the Underwriting Agreement in the event of breach or
threatened breach by the Financing Sources, in each case, to the extent
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
Closing. The Financing shall be in an aggregate amount sufficient, together
with the Alternate Financing, if any, and any other sources available to
Parent and Merger Sub (including cash balances and borrowings under Parents
corporate debt facilities), to fund the payment of the Merger Consideration
and to make any other payment required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the related fees and expenses, in
each case required to be made on the Closing Date. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of, or receiving notice or other
communication with respect to, any material breach of or default under, or any
event or circumstance that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach of or default
under, the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement by a party
thereto prior to the Closing or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of
the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement prior to the Closing
(other than as a result of consummation of an Alternate Financing or as a
result of the cancellation by Parent of any of the undrawn commitment under
the Commitment Documents if, after giving effect to such cancellation, the
amount of remaining funding available to Parent under the Financing and any
Alternate Financing, together with any other sources available to

 



      
 

 



 

Parent (including cash balances and borrowings under Parents corporate debt
facilities), is sufficient to fund the payment of the Merger Consideration and
to make any other payment required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to pay the related fees and expenses, in each case
required to be made on the Closing Date (" _Commitment Reduction Event_ ")).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and
Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the availability nor
terms of the Financing or any Alternate Financing are conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which are subject only to the
express conditions set forth in _Article III_, irrespective and independent
of the availability or terms of the Financing or any Alternate Financing,
Parents or Merger Subs use of efforts in accordance with this _Section
7.07_, or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or
otherwise as a result of consummation of an Alternate Financing or the
occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event, (i) terminate or permit the
termination, withdrawal, repudiation or rescission of, or release the
obligations of any Financing Sources under, any of the Commitment Documents or
the Underwriting Agreement prior to the Closing, or (ii) permit any amendment
or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or
replace, any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement;
provided, that Parent may amend the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting
Agreement to add Financing Sources, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities or guarantors who have not executed the Commitment
Documents or the Underwriting Agreement as of the date hereof and provided
further that Parent may make an amendment or modification to, or obtain or
grant a waiver under, any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting
Agreement where such amendment, modification or waiver would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to obtain any funding under
the Financing which Parent requires to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of
the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing (or any Alternate
Financing), including by providing prompt written notice to the Company (i) of
(x) any breach or default (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened breach
or default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default) by any party to any of the
Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement or any actual or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened termination, withdrawal, repudiation or
rescission of any of the Commitment Documents other than as a result of the
consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment
Reduction Event or (y) any dispute or disagreement between or among Parent, on
the one hand, and the Financing Sources under the Financing on the other hand,
with respect to the obligation to fund any of the Financing or the amount of
the Financing to be funded at the Closing, and (ii) if at any time for any
reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the aggregate amount of the Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement other than as a result of
the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment
Reduction Event.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, on a timely basis,
all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent or customary in
connection with the arrangement or consummation of, or the compliance by
Parent of its obligations under, the Financing or any Alternate Financing
(provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including
using its reasonable best efforts to if requested in writing by Parent, (i) as
promptly as reasonably practicable provide (x) such financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as

Alternate Financing including any such information as is customary to be
included in syndication or offering materials contemplated by the Financing or
Alternate Financing and (y) (A)(1) audited consolidated financial statements

recently completed fiscal year ended at least ninety days before the Closing

respect to any quarter-end that is also a fiscal year-end, and (3) all
financial information about the Company requested in writing reasonably
required in order to prepare (I) a pro forma consolidated statement of income
of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal year

this clause (Y), a corresponding statement for the corresponding period of the

reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any offering memoranda or
similar documents, or any materials for rating agencies, that include

connection with the Financing or Alternate Financing. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to (A) pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other liability or obligation of any kind, including under any
guarantee or pledge or any other document relating to the Financing or
Alternate Financing, in connection with the Financing or Alternate Financing
prior to the Closing Date, (B) enter into any binding agreement or commitment,
or adopt any resolution or otherwise take any corporate or similar action, in
connection with the Financing or Alternate Financing that is not conditioned
on the occurrence of the Closing Date, or (C) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to (1) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) cause any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement to be breached or any condition set
forth in _Article III_ to fail to be satisfied except where Parent expressly
waives such breach or noncompliance, (3) cause any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal

Company Subsidiaries to provide any access, documents or information that

reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 7.07_ and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective directors and other Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the Financing or Alternate Financing and any
information used in connection therewith (except with respect to any
information provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), and
any action taken by any of them at the written request of Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to this _Section 7.07(d)_.

 



 

(e) If prior to the Closing the Financing becomes unavailable for any reason
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Documents or
Underwriting Agreement, other than as a result of the consummation of an
Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event, Parent
shall (i) as promptly as practicable after obtaining Knowledge that such
portion has become or is reasonably expected to become unavailable, notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following such Financing becoming unavailable, replacement debt or equity
financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated) (" _Replacement Financing_ ") from the same or other
sources pursuant to commitment letters (or other agreements) and on terms and
conditions that are not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than such
unavailable Financing (including the "flex" provisions contained in any fee
letter) or on other terms and conditions acceptable to Parent, pursuant to
commitment letters (or other agreements) (complete and correct executed copies
of which shall be promptly provided to the Company; provided, that any fee
letter (or similar confidential letter) may be redacted in a customary manner
solely with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to fee amounts, yield and interest caps, original issue discount amounts and
"flex" and "securities demand" terms and other similar economic terms that are
confidential and do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or
conditionality of or the aggregate amount of net proceeds available under the
Replacement Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such Replacement
Financing may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding of the Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in the Commitment
Documents or the Underwriting Agreement, respectively, in effect on the date
hereof where such expanded conditions precedent or contingencies would
reasonably be expected to make the funding of such Replacement Financing less
likely to occur than would be the case (or would have been the case) in
relation to the Financing that has become or is reasonably expected to become
unavailable or otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that
would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such Replacement Financing
less likely to occur than would be the case (or would have been the case) in
relation to the Financing that has become or is reasonably expected to become
unavailable. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Commitment
Documents," "Underwriting Agreement" and "Financing" shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or other agreement), underwriting agreement or
commitment or any fee letter referred to in such commitment letter or
underwriting agreement with respect to any Replacement Financing arranged in
compliance with this _Section 7.07(e)_ (and any Commitment Documents and
Financing remaining in effect at the time in question).

 



 

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the parties
hereto obtained by the other parties pursuant to this _Section 7.07_ (other
than information that is to be disclosed in connection with the Offer) shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company agrees that Parent and Merger Sub may share non-
public or otherwise confidential information with the Financing Sources and
that Parent, Merger Sub and such Financing Sources may share such information
with potential Financing Sources in connection with the marketing efforts
related to the Financing or the Alternate Financing if the recipients of such
information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements, including "click-
through" confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions contained
in customary bank books and offering memoranda. The Company hereby consents to
use of the logos of the Company and its Subsidiaries on customary marketing
materials in connection with the Financing or the Alternate Financing.

 



 

(g) With respect to the Indebtedness set forth in _Section 7.07(g)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Specified Indebtedness_ ") of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries identified by Parent in writing at least
fifteen Business Days prior to the Closing Date to be repaid in connection
with the consummation of the Merger, (i) the Company shall, or shall have
caused the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all
notices and take other actions required to facilitate the termination of
commitments in respect of such Indebtedness, repayment in full of all
outstanding obligations in respect of such Indebtedness and release of any
Liens and guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date, in each
case, subject to clause (y) of this _Section 7.07(g)_, and (ii) no later than
one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall have
caused the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide a
copy to Parent of customary payoff letters with respect to such Indebtedness
(each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in substantially final form and in form and
substance customarily provided by the agents of such Specified Indebtedness
with respect to the payoff thereof, which Payoff Letters shall (x) indicate
the total amount required to

 



      
 

 



 

be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums,
penalties, breakage costs or other outstanding and unpaid obligations related
to such Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, other than any customary expense
reserves or amounts necessary to cash collateralize reimbursement obligations
with respect to letters of credit issued thereunder as set forth in the
applicable loan documents for such Specified Indebtedness (the " _Payoff
Amount_ ") and (y) state that all obligations (including guarantees) in
respect thereof, other than those obligations which by their terms survive
repayment of the obligations, and Liens in connection therewith on the assets
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise on the business operated
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be, substantially concurrently
with the receipt of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date by the Persons
holding such Indebtedness, released, or arrangements reasonably satisfactory
to Parent for such release shall have been made by such time, subject, as
applicable, to the replacement (or cash collateralization or backstopping) of
any then outstanding letters of credit or similar Indebtedness.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement (including
this Section 7.07) or the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company consents to
the public disclosure of the documents issued in connection with the Offer and
the information contained therein.

 



 

SECTION 7.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of

reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to

16b­3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 7.09 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving

between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and any employee, former employee

Subsidiary in effect, or as approved by the Company Board prior to, or as of

agreements or other similar compensation plans between the Company or a
Company Subsidiary and any employee, former employee or director, or any group

Company or any Company Subsidiary from (i) amending any severance plan (for
the avoidance of doubt, other than items (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section
6.01(a)(iv)(1)(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) at any time from and after
the Effective Time provided that such amendments do not reduce the benefit
available under the severance plan for a period ending twelve months following
the Effective Time to a qualified participant as of the Effective Time, or
(ii) suspending or terminating any severance plan beginning twelve months
following the Effective Time.

individual, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) for a period of six months
following the Closing Date, a base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus

Closing, (ii) for a period from Closing until the earlier of (x) six months
following the Closing Date or (y) September 30, 2017, short term sales or

prior to the Closing and (iii) for a period of six months following the
Closing Date, with employee benefits (excluding short term and long term cash
or equity incentives) that are either (A) substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time; or (B) with respect to Continuing Employees who become
eligible to participate in existing benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries during such period, such benefits as are provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who participate in such
plans.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each Continuing
Employees service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries attributable
to any period before the Effective Time to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual or benefit levels other than with respect to vacation, paid time off
and severance) under each employee benefit plan or program of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") in which any such Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to make any Continuing Employees eligible for any
specific Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.09_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other person,
including any Continuing Employee or beneficiary thereof. Nothing in this
_Section 7.09_ shall be construed to prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or
any Subsidiary thereof from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time, or amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all action necessary (i) to ensure that no new offering
periods under the Company ESPP will commence during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (ii) with respect to any
offering period in effect as of the date of this Agreement that is scheduled
to end later than ten days before the Effective Time, to cause such offering
period to end no later than ten days before the Effective Time, and (iii) for
the Company ESPP to terminate in its entirety effective as of the Effective
Time.

 



 

SECTION 7.10 _Director Resignation_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignation of all of the members of the Company Board
who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent
requested by Parent, from any member

 



      
 

 



 

of the board of directors (or any equivalent) of each Company Subsidiary),
which resignations shall be effective at, and contingent upon the occurrence
of, the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 7.11 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

that the maximum amount of the Expense Reimbursement shall be increased to
$37,000,000 if this Agreement is terminated after the Equity Financing
Consummation has occurred. The payment of the Expense Reimbursement shall not
relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_; _provided_ that the Company shall be entitled
to a credit against payment of the Termination Fee (without interest) in
respect of any Expense Reimbursement previously paid. Any Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds
within two Business Days following delivery to the Company of an invoice

(e) Each party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the applicable party fails promptly
to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit, action or other
proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor for such payment, then in
addition to such payment the failing party shall pay to the other party its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest on the amount of
such payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins accruing, or a
lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. The parties agree
that, absent fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company, the
payment of the Termination Fee, together with the Expense Reimbursement owed
pursuant to _Section 8.03(d)_ (which amount may be credited against the
Termination Fee), shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company and the acceptance of
such Termination Fee by Parent, the Company, the Companys Affiliates and its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and
Representatives shall have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement. The parties agree that, absent fraud or any Willful Breach of
this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee (together with the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.07_) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to the Company with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable,
and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee by Parent and the acceptance
of such Parent Termination Fee by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Parents
and Merger Subs Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to
the Company under this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that
the Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee are not intended to be a
penalty but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which
the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, are due and
payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while

 



   

     
 

 



 

negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. In no event shall Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall require Parent to accept the Termination Fee or the Company to accept
the Parent Termination Fee, or forego their respective right to seek specific
performance pursuant to _Section 9.10_.

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LITIGATION IN ANY WAY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR
OTHERWISE) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 



 

SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, delegated or
transferred, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of Law
or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties; _provided_ that the rights, interests and obligations of Merger
Sub may be assigned to another direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent without the consent of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Parent may assign its rights under

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement in connection with any sale or transfer of equity securities
of, or any merger, consolidation, change of control or other business
combination involving, Parent provided that such assignment does not relieve
Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including the right of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. It is agreed that the
parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a) below,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware), (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each party further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document on the agent for service
in the United States as designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
shall be deemed to be effective service of process in the courts described in
this _Section 9.10_ for any legal proceeding brought by the Company against
Parent or Parent against the Company, as applicable, in such courts arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

 



      
 

 



 

AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.11_.

 



 

SECTION 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this _Section 9.12_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



 

SECTION 9.14 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Company Disclosure
Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for _Section
7.05_, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies.
