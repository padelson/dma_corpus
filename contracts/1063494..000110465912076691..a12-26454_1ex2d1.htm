ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, as part of an integrated transaction and plan of
merger, and immediately prior to the subsequent merger of the Company with the
Successor Subsidiary (the " **Second Step Merger** "), Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the **"Merger"** ) with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the **"Surviving
Corporation"** ). Immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation
shall be merged with and into the Successor Subsidiary, whereupon the separate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease, and the Successor
Subsidiary shall be the surviving limited liability company as a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. There shall be no condition to the completion of
the Second Step Merger other than the completion of the Merger. From and after
the Second Step Merger, Successor Subsidiary shall be the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of this Agreement. Immediately after the completion
of the Second Step Merger, Parent shall own all of the membership interests
and other equity in Successor Subsidiary, and Successor Subsidiary shall be
disregarded for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
**"Closing"** ) shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri at the offices of
Bryan Cave LLP, 211 North Broadway, Suite 3600, St. Louis, Missouri 63102 ****
as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two business days after
the date the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree (the **"Closing Date"** ).

 



 

(c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the **"Effective Time"** ) as
the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State
(or at such later time as permitted by Delaware Law as Parent and the Company
shall agree and shall be specified in the certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject
to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

ARTICLE 3

Subsidiary, Successor Subsidiary,

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or any holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company, Merger
Subsidiary, Successor Subsidiary or Parent, the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.05, each share of Company
Common Stock (each, a **"Company Share"** , and together, the **"Company
Shares"** ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent or by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (the " **Affiliated
Shares** ") and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock owned by stockholders ("
**Dissenting Stockholders** ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand
for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (the " **Dissenting
Shares** ," and together with the Affiliated Shares, the " **Company Excluded
Shares** ")) shall be converted into the right to receive and shall become
exchangeable for: (i) cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the Cash
Consideration and (ii) a portion of a share **** of common stock, par value
$0.15 per share, of Parent ( **"Parent Common Stock"** ) equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the " **Stock Consideration** "). For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Merger Consideration** " with respect to a given Company Share shall
mean the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration.

 



 

At the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i)(A) each
certificate (a **"Certificate"** ) formerly representing any of such Company
Shares (other than Company Excluded Shares) and (B) each uncertificated
Company Share (an **"Uncertificated Company Share"** ) registered to a holder
on the stock transfer books of the Company (other than Company Excluded
Shares), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable,
and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 3.02(g) cash in lieu of
fractional shares otherwise receivable pursuant to this Section 3.01(a) and
any distributions or dividends pursuant to Section 3.02(f), in each case
without interest and (ii) each Dissenting Share shall thereinafter represent
only the right to receive the payments set forth in Section 3.03 with respect
to such Dissenting Share.

 



 

(b) Each Company Share that is owned by Parent or by the Company or any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and, in each case, not held
on behalf of third parties, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger
Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted, and which share shall constitute all of
the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.02 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint (subject to the
Companys prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) a
commercial bank or trust company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose
of exchanging Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares for the Merger
Consideration or the consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable.
As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Company Shares (other than Company Excluded
Shares), for exchange in accordance with this Section through the Exchange
Agent, securities representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and
payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.05, as applicable, in exchange
for outstanding Company Shares (other than Company Excluded Shares) in respect
of the Stock Consideration to be paid in the Merger or the consideration
described in Section 3.05, as applicable, the cash necessary to pay for the
aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to this Article 3 and, after
the Effective Time, if applicable, any cash and dividends or other
distribution with respect to the Parent Common Stock to be issued or to be
paid pursuant to this Article 3 (together, the " **Exchange Fund** "). If a
Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its
rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, (i) such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be
Company Excluded Shares and (ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be
made available to the Exchange Agent (A)(1) additional funds in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which such
Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to,
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the Cash Consideration
and (2) additional shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x)
the number of Dissenting Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL and (y) the Stock Consideration or (B) additional shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of Dissenting
Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or
lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the
consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable. Promptly after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three **** business days), Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Company Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such
exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration or the consideration described in Section
3.05, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive, upon delivery of the
Ownership Evidence, the Merger Consideration or the consideration described in
Section 3.05, as applicable, in respect of the Company Shares represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share and any cash and dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to be issued or to
be paid pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.01(a). Until so surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Company Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration or the consideration described
in Section 3.05, as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration or the consideration described
in Section 3.05, as applicable, is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Company Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Company Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share or establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares are presented to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration or the
consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable, and cash, dividends or
other distributions to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 3.02(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or
otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not
exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 3.01 or the consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable,
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration or the consideration described in Section 3.05, as
applicable, and any cash, dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect
of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in
respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of such Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered or undelivered
Ownership Evidence until such Ownership Evidence is provided to the Exchange
Agent or Parent in accordance with this Article 3. Subject to the effect of
Applicable Laws, following surrender or delivery, as applicable, of any such
Ownership Evidence to the Exchange Agent or Parent in accordance with this
Article 3, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Ownership
Evidence representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as
the case may be, the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or
after the Effective Time and a

 



      
 

 



 

payment date on or prior to the date of issuance of such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective
Time on the Closing Date but with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
delivery and not previously paid.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in respect of any Company Shares
and any holder of Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.02(g) shall be entitled to receive
in lieu thereof an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying
such fraction (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the Closing
Parent Common Stock Price (the aggregate amount of cash required to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the " **Aggregate Fractional
Share Consideration** ").

 



 

(h) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
any Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 



 

(i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of
a bond in the form customarily required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, and the
submission of such other documentation as Parent customarily requires for the
replacement of lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, the Exchange Agent (or
Parent pursuant to Section 3.02(e)) will deliver a certificate evidencing the
ownership of such number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or any cash,
dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.03 _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration or the
consideration described in Section 3.05, as applicable, with respect to such
Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with
respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until a Dissenting Stockholder
shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to,
appraisal under the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Applicable Laws
that are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal
and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that prior to the
Effective Time there is a change in the number of Company Shares or shares of
Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration or the consideration described in
Section 3.05, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the
effects of such event on the Merger Consideration or the consideration
described in Section 3.05, as applicable.

 



 

Section 3.05 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is subject
to a written agreement between the Company and the holder that provides for a
waiver of certain vesting rights in the form mutually agreed to by the Company
and Parent (a " **Letter Agreement** ") (x) shall be deemed converted into the
right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company
Shares granted pursuant to such Company Restricted Stock Award and (ii) the
Equity Exchange Ratio and (y) following the Effective Time, shall be governed
by the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement and such other
terms and conditions as may be set forth in a separate award agreement and not
inconsistent with the terms of such Letter Agreement. Each Company Share
granted pursuant to a Company Restricted Stock Award that is not subject to a
Letter Agreement shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, become fully
vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted into the right to receive and
shall become exchangeable for the Merger Consideration. In each case, unless
the holder of the applicable Company Restricted Stock Award makes arrangements
to pay taxes in cash, in accordance with customary procedures established by
the Company, the award shall be subject to withholding on such restricted
stock award in an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable taxes regardless of
whether such restricted stock award is otherwise transferable at such time.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
granted pursuant to a Company Restricted Stock Unit award shall be fully
vested in accordance with its terms, convert into the right to receive and
shall become exchangeable for the Merger Consideration, provided that
applicable Taxes will be withheld as required with respect to the
consideration payable or deliverable; and further provided that the foregoing
will not apply to any Company Restricted Stock Unit award for which the holder
has made a change in control override election (whether pursuant to a written
agreement between the Company and the holder or otherwise) (each such award, a
" **Continuing RSU Award** "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Continuing RSU Award shall convert into the right to receive the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of
Company Shares subject to such Continuing RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each such Continuing RSU Award shall be settled at the
time due under the terms of such award or valid and applicable payment
election in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Company Shares or benefits measured by the value of Company
Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Company Shares that may be
held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any stock-
based or other incentive compensation plan or arrangement of the Company other
than any Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company Restricted Stock Unit
awards **** (the **"Company Awards"** ), except as otherwise set forth in an
agreement, shall be deemed to be converted into the right to acquire or
receive benefits measured by the value of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Equity Exchange Ratio. If any such Company Award provided for an exercise
price, such exercise price shall be adjusted by dividing such exercise price
by the Equity Exchange Ratio, and each such right shall otherwise be subject
to the terms and conditions applicable to such right under the relevant
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company.
Except as specifically provided in a letter agreement, following the Effective
Time, each Company Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, any vesting requirements) as were
applicable under such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Company Awards, and any other equity award discussed herein, shall be subject
to applicable tax withholding.

 



 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company
shall adopt such resolutions, and the Company shall otherwise take all
actions, as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 3.05(a),
(b) and (c).

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain Letter Agreements
and any consents from holders of Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company
Restricted Stock Unit awards (other than Continuing RSU Awards) and make any
amendments to the terms of such equity or compensation plans or arrangements
that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 3.05 and to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payment may be withheld
in respect of any Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company Restricted Stock
Unit awards (other than Continuing RSU Awards) until such necessary consents
are obtained. The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
Surviving Corporation will not be bound at the Effective Time by any options,
or other rights, awards or arrangements under any employee stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement or other third party agreements of the
Company that would entitle any Person after the Effective Time to beneficially
own any Company Shares or to receive any payments in respect thereof.

 



 

(f) If registration of any interest in Parents 2001 Incentive Stock Plan (or
other applicable equity incentive plan) or the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable thereunder is required under the 1933 Act, Parent shall file with the
SEC within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to such interests or Parent Common Stock,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for so long as the relevant stock plans remain in
effect and such registration of interests therein or the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required.

other than Employee Plans maintained outside of the United States primarily
for the benefit of employees working outside of the United States (the "
**Non-U.S. Employee Plans** ") and written interpretations thereof have been
furnished to Parent together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500
including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990)
prepared in connection with any such plan or trust.

retire as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Affiliate of the Company of incurring a material liability under Title IV of
ERISA, (C) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted
proceedings under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate any Employee Plan, (D) no
event has occurred that would be reasonably expected to subject the Company or
any current or former ERISA Affiliate of the Company to any tax, fine, lien,
penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable
Laws, rules and regulations, (E) all premium payments required to have been
made to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have been paid, and (F) the
present value of all aggregate "benefit liabilities" (whether or not vested)

not exceed the current value of such plans assets of the most recent
actuarial valuation date.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever made or been required
to make any contributions to any Multiemployer Plan (as defined in ERISA
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3)).

 



 

(e) During the six year period ending on the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has terminated or taken action to terminate,

(f) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that it is so
qualified, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter should be
revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Parent prior to
date of this Agreement copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee
Plan (other than the Non-U.S. Employee Plans) has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and Applicable Laws, including ERISA and
the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No events have occurred
with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or

 



      
 

 



 

assessment by or against the Company of any excise taxes under Sections 4972,
4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code except for
failures to comply that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Each Employee Plan which provides "nonqualified deferred
compensation" as defined in Code Section 409A has been administered in
accordance with and meets the requirements of Code Section 409A except for
failures to comply that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to

Subsidiaries in accordance with past practice and the recommended contribution
in the applicable actuarial report and in accordance with ERISA and the Code
as applicable. All insurance premiums with regard to the Employee Plans that

trigger or accelerate the time of payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits payable to any such person,
(iii) accelerate the vesting of any compensation or benefits of any such
person (including any stock options or other equity-based awards, any
incentive compensation or any deferred compensation entitlement) or (iv)
trigger any other material obligation to any such person. _Section 5.17(g) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists all the agreements, arrangements and
other instruments which give rise to an obligation to make or set aside
amounts payable to or on behalf of the officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and/or any subsequent employment termination (whether by the Company or the
officer), true and complete copies of which have been provided to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on _Section 5.17(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_, there is no Employee Plan that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

 



 

(h) With respect to each Employee Plan that provides health, medical or life
insurance benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to employees or

Employee Plan may be terminated or amended to reduce benefits or limit the
liability of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, in each case, without
material liability to the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates on or at any
time after the Effective Time.

 



 

(i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which

make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other than a statement
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act during the initial period of
ten (10) business days following the commencement of the Acquisition Proposal,
shall be considered an adverse modification, recommend, adopt or approve or
publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal), or
take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** "), (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar instrument constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third
Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information
about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return
or destroy all such information. During the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall not take any actions to make any state takeover statute
(including any Delaware state takeover statute) or similar statute
inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by Companys stockholders (and in no event after the adoption of
this Agreement by Companys stockholders), the board of directors of the
Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may, subject to compliance with Section 7.03(c), (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 7.03(a) has made after the date of this
Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that the board of directors of the Company reasonably believes (after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided, promptly after its execution, for informational purposes only to
Parent); provided that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party) and (iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each
case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure
to take such action would more likely than not be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties

 



      
 

 



 

under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the board of
directors of the Company from complying with requirements of Rule 14e-2(a) and
Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long
as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 7.03; provided, that such requirement will in no way eliminate or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such requirement would otherwise
have under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 7.03(b) unless the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in
no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third
Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has
made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided orally and in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including
any changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis, of the status and significant details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request and shall promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all significant
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

 **"** **Superior Proposal** **"** means any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that for purposes of this definition
all references to "15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%") on terms that the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (i) that
if consummated, is more favorable to Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected timing
and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any governmental and other
approval requirements), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the person making the
proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, legal and other
aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or determined to be
available or reasonably capable of being obtained in the good faith judgment
of the board of directors of the Company.

 



 

Section 7.04 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable
access to its offices, properties, books and records during normal business
hours, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as such

 



      
 

 



 

Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate
with Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company. All information furnished pursuant to
this Section shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated July 26,
2012, as amended August 15, 2012 and October 11, 2012, between Parent and the
Company (the **"Confidentiality Agreement"** ). No information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.05 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except in the ordinary course of business or, as required by Applicable
Law or with Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall make or change any Tax election, change any annual tax
accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any
material amended Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds, settle or resolve any
material Tax controversy or surrender any Tax claim, audit or assessment,
surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, consent to any extension or waiver
of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment with
respect to a material amount of Taxes.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent and give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Action brought by any stockholder of the Company against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no settlement of any such Action shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

ARTICLE 8 
COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

Parent agrees that:

 



 

Section 8.01 _Conduct of Parent_. To the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
except as set forth on _Section 8.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule_, or
with the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

 



 

(a) amend their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
similar organizational documents (whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise);

 



 

(b) split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock;

 



       
 

 



 

(c) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other distribution
(whether in cash, stock, property or any combination thereof) in respect of
any shares of its capital stock or other securities (other than dividends or
distributions by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries), _provided that_ the
foregoing shall not limit Parent in respect of repurchasing its own shares in
compliance with Applicable Law;

 



 

(d) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of Parent
hereunder inaccurate in any material respect at, or as of any time before, the
Effective Time or would materially delay the Closing; or

 



 

(e) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing with an effective date
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary and Successor Subsidiary_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary and
Successor Subsidiary to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, the Second Step Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries, if any, in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company (each an **"Indemnified Person"** ) in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under
the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law and Parent or
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent provided under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall provide officers and directors liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the
Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ , in satisfying its
obligation to provide such insurance coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the Companys
current annual premium for such insurance, which amount the Company has
disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided further_ ,
that if the annual

 



      
 

 



 

premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at the Companys election (prior to the Closing) or Parents
election (subsequent to the Closing), in lieu of obtaining or providing the
officers and directors liability insurance coverage contemplated above,
Company may prior to the Closing or Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
subsequent to the Closing purchase a non-cancelable "tail" coverage insurance
policy under the Companys current officers and directors liability
insurance policies (providing coverage not less favorable than provided by
such insurance in effect on the date hereof), which tail policy shall be
effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date
six years from the Closing Date, covering each Indemnified Person covered as
of the date of this Agreement by the Companys officers and directors
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time; _provided that_ the Company shall not pay a premium for
such tail insurance prior to the Closing in an amount that exceeds, on an
annualized basis, 200% of the Companys current annual premium for such
insurance.

 



 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger (including pursuant to the Second Step Merger), or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 8.04.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Registration Statement_. Subject to Section 9.02(a), Parent
shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC under the 1933 Act the
Registration Statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Formation of Merger Subsidiary and Successor Subsidiary;
Accession_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and
in any event within five calendar days after the date hereof, Parent shall
form (i) a Delaware corporation as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(" **Merger Subsidiary** ") and (ii) a Delaware limited liability company as a
direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent which is disregarded from Parent ("
**Successor Subsidiary** "). As of its incorporation, and at the Effective
Time, Merger Subsidiary shall have 1,000 authorized shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of which 1,000 shares shall

 



      
 

 



 

be outstanding and held by Parent and none of which shall be held in the
treasury of Merger Subsidiary. As of its formation, and at the Effective
Time, Parent will be the sole member of Successor Subsidiary. Promptly after
incorporating Merger Subsidiary and forming Successor Subsidiary, (x) Parent
shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the board of
directors of Merger Subsidiary to unanimously approve this Agreement and
declare it advisable for Merger Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, (y)
Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary and as the sole member of
Successor Subsidiary, shall approve and adopt this Agreement and (z) Parent
shall cause each of Merger Subsidiary and Successor Subsidiary to accede to
this Agreement by executing a signature page to this Agreement, after which
time each of Merger Subsidiary and Successor Subsidiary shall be a party
hereto for all purposes set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, the obligations of each of Merger Subsidiary and Successor
Subsidiary to perform its respective covenants hereunder shall commence only
at the time of its incorporation or formation, as applicable. From and after
the date of its incorporation or organization, as applicable, and prior to the
Effective Time, neither Merger Subsidiary nor Successor Subsidiary shall
engage in any activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by
this Agreement or have any assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Employee Matters_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be provided to each individual who is employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those
individuals covered by collective bargaining agreements) and who remain
employed with the Surviving Corporation or any of Parents Subsidiaries (each
an " **Affected Employee** ") compensation and employee benefits (" **Affected
Employee Comp and Benefits** ") substantially comparable in the aggregate, at
Parents election, to (i) the compensation and benefits provided to the
Affected Employee under the Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) the compensation (including base salary and participation in the
bonus program(s) for Parent and its Subsidiaries) and benefits provided by
Parent under the plans and programs generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that
such bonus program(s) of Parent and its Subsidiaries are subjective in nature.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected Employee
first becomes eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time (the "
**New Company Plans** "), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any health and welfare
New Company Plans in which such Affected Employee may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time and (ii) recognize service of Affected
Employees (or otherwise credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and level of benefits (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual
under defined benefit pension plans) under any New Company Plan in which such
Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any credit be given to the
extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 



 

(c) It is understood that Parents expressed intention to extend offers of
continued employment as set forth in this Section 8.08 shall not constitute
any commitment,

 



      
 

 



 

contract or understanding (expressed or implied) of any obligation on the part
of Parent or its Subsidiaries to a post Closing employment relationship of any
fixed term or duration or upon any terms or conditions. Employment offered by
Parent or its Subsidiaries is "at will" and such employment may be terminated
by Parent or its Subsidiaries or by an employee at any time for any reason
(subject to any written commitments to the contrary made by Parent or its
Subsidiaries or an employee and legal requirements). Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of Parent to
terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Affected Employees after the
Closing or to change adversely or favorably the title, powers, duties,
responsibilities, functions locations, salaries, other compensation or terms
or conditions of employment of such employees.

 



 

(d) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to (in
each case at no expense to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such
successor, other than immaterial administrative expenses), provide coverage
under Parents medical and dental benefit plans for eligible dependents of
certain deceased former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries related
to the events of September 11, 2001 who were eligible to receive or receiving
such benefits immediately prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company or an
entity designated by the board of directors of the Company shall determine a
bonus amount for the Companys 2012 fiscal year for each eligible employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to _Section 8.08(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_. Such bonus amounts will be paid by Parent promptly
following the Closing Date; provided that if the Closing has not occurred
prior to the last date on which it is administratively possible for the
Company to complete payment of the bonus amounts by March 15, 2013, the
Company will pay the bonus amounts no later than March 15, 2013.

 



 

(f) Except as provided in Section 8.04, no provision in this Agreement,
including without limitation this Section 8.08, shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any person, entity, or organization, including without
limitation employees or former employees (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, unions or other
representatives of such employees or former employees, or trustees,
administrators, participants, or beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan,
and no provision of this Agreement shall create such third-party beneficiary
rights in any such person or organization in respect of any benefits that may
be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan that is
or may in the future be maintained by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or the
Parent. No provision of this Agreement, including without limitation this
Section 8.08, shall be deemed to amend any employee benefit plan that is or
may in the future be maintained by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or the
Parent.

Successor Subsidiary and the Company will be a party to that reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; it being understood that in
rendering such opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on tax
representation letters delivered to it by the Company, Merger Subsidiary and
Parent containing customary representations with respect to such matters and
(B) an opinion of Bryan Cave LLP, counsel to Parent, dated the Closing Date,
or other counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the effect that the
Reorganization will be treated for Federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Successor Subsidiary and the Company will
be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code; it being understood that in rendering such opinion, such counsel shall
be entitled to rely on tax representation letters delivered to it by the
Company and Parent containing customary representations with respect to such
matters, including the execution and delivery of the tax representation
letters referred to therein.

 



 

(b) If the opinions of Bryan Cave LLP and Sullivan and Cromwell LLP have been

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that could reasonably

10.02(b), Section 10.03(a) or Section 10.03(b) not to be satisfied; and

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 



 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before March 31, 2013 (the

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any

shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
10.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; or

 



 

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that any

Company shall have failed to consummate the Closing within the time period
required by Section 2.01(b); or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Company if:

 



 

(i) the board of directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a written agreement
concerning a Superior Proposal; provided, that the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid, any amounts due pursuant to Section 12.04(b) in accordance with
the terms, and at the times, specified therein; and _provided_ , further,
that, prior to any such termination, (A) the Company notifies Parent in

a Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of such agreement (or
a description of all material terms and conditions thereof), and (B) Parent
does not make, within four days of receipt of such written notification, an
offer that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood that the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement or enter into any such binding agreement during such four day
period, and that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the
Company and an additional three (3) day period from the date of such
notification);

 



 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in

satisfied by the End Date; or

 



 

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that any
such conditions set forth in Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 are capable of
satisfaction as of the date on which the Closing otherwise would have

termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto (except as provided in Section 12.04(b)); _provided_ that, if
such termination shall result from the (i) failure of either party to fulfill
a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii)
failure of either party to perform a covenant hereof or (iii) willful or
reckless breach by any party of any representation or warranty contained
herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and

Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

Company Stockholder Approval without their further approval.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 12.04 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense; provided however, Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay
one half of (i) the filing fee for filing the Registration Statement with the
SEC, and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement (other than attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, which
shall be paid by the party incurring such expense), and (ii) the filing fees
for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act and any premerger
notification and reports formed under similar applicable antitrust law of any
non-United States governmental antitrust authority.

 



 

(b) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay
Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two business
days following such Payment Event, a fee equal to Seventeen Million Two
Hundred Fifty Five Thousand Dollars ($17,255,000) **** (the **"Termination
Fee** ").

 



 

 **"** **Payment Event** **"** means the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to (x) Section 11.01(d)(i), (y) Section 11.01(b)(i) (if a vote of the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been held prior to such
termination) or (z) Section 11.01(c)(i), provided that, (A) in the case of
clause (y), only if both (1) after the date hereof and prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, or the date of termination, as the case may be, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made, and (2) within 12 months following
the date of such termination: (I) the Company merges with or into, or is
acquired, directly or

 



      
 

 



 

indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal; (II) such Person, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of
the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or
(III) such Person, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Shares (or in any of clauses (I) through (III) the Company
shall have entered into any contract or agreement providing for such action,
in which case the Payment Event shall be the later date on which such action
is completed) and (B) in the case of clause (z), in the event that such
Adverse Recommendation Change or failure to confirm the Company Board
Recommendation was, in whole or in part, the result of the occurrence of a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, both (A) after the date hereof and prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting, or the date of termination, as the case may
be, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made, and (B) within 12 months
following the date of such termination: (1) the Company merges with or into,
or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal; (2) such Person, directly or indirectly,
acquires more than 50% of the total assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (3) such Person, directly or indirectly,
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding Company Shares (or in any of clauses
(1) through (3) the Company shall have entered into any contract or agreement
providing for such action, in which case the Payment Event shall be the later
date on which such action is completed).

 



 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Successor
Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company
fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Successor
Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 12.04, it shall also pay any costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
Successor Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount,
together with interest on any amount of the Termination Fee at a rate per
annum equal to 3% over the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street
Journal) in effect on the date such payment should have been made.

 



 

Section 12.05 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 



 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 8.04, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.04,
no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Successor Subsidiary may
transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any
time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
Successor Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change
any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or Successor Subsidiary.

 



 

Section 12.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.07 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event (but only
in the event) that neither such court has jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, the Delaware Superior Court, so long as one of such courts shall
have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and
that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 



 

Section 12.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



 

Section 12.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 12.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter thereof.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any court specified in Section 12.07, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
