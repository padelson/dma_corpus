virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, Reckson or the Reckson Common Shareholders, each Reckson Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined herein) of Reckson, Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent (other than, in each case, shares in
trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like that
are beneficially owned by third parties) shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

  

## 

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, Reckson or the Reckson
Common Shareholders, each Reckson Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Reckson Common Shares
that are cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4(a), automatically shall be
converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the sum of
(A) $31.68 per share and (B) an amount in cash equal to the Prorated Dividend
(such sum being referred to as

  



        
   

  



  

### the " **Cash Consideration** ") and (ii) 0.10387 (the " **Exchange Ratio**
") of a share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the
" **Parent Common Stock** "), subject to adjustment as provided in Section
1.4(d) (the " **Stock Consideration** " and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " **Merger Consideration** "). All such Reckson Common
Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and automatically
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Common Share Certificate (as defined herein) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to
be paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Common Share
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest, together with
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(l) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Reckson Common
Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(b) and the amounts,
if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iv), Section 1.10 and Section
1.11.

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Purchaser, Reckson or the Reckson Common
Shareholders, each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into
and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  

### 

  

### (d) If prior to the Effective Time, Reckson should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Reckson Common Shares, or make a distribution in
Reckson Common Shares, or otherwise change the Reckson Common Shares into any
other securities, or make or pay any other dividend or distribution (other
than the dividends expressly permitted pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and other
than pursuant to Section 1.10 or Section 1.11) in respect of the Reckson
Common Shares, then (without limiting any other rights of Parent or
Purchaser hereunder), the Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted. If
prior to the Effective Time Parent should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Parent Common Stock, or make a distribution in Parent Common
Stock, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock into other securities, or
make or pay any other dividend or distribution (other than dividends
expressly permitted pursuant to Section 4.2(b)), the Exchange Ratio shall be
ratably adjusted. In the event that either Reckson or Parent shall declare or
pay any dividend or distribution, other than the regular quarterly cash
dividends otherwise permitted hereunder and other than pursuant to Section
1.10 or Section 1.11, including for the purpose of maintaining its status as
a REIT or of eliminating any U.S. federal income or excise Taxes otherwise
payable, the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as described below. In the
event of such a dividend or distribution by Reckson, the Cash Consideration

Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Any cash or Parent Common Stock

action pursuant to this Section 1.11 in violation of Law, that would cause a

Consideration. Any cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of the
Deeded Properties shall be distributed by the Operating Partnership to its
partners and by Reckson to its stockholders immediately prior to,
and conditioned upon, the Effective Time. If any Deeded Properties are
purchased for cash, the aggregate of the cash proceeds from the sale of the
Deeded Properties pursuant to this Section 1.11 and the cash purchase price
for the Designated Properties pursuant to Section 1.10 shall not exceed the
aggregate of the Cash Consideration and the cash portion of the Partnership
Merger Consideration, and the Cash Consideration and the cash portion of the
Partnership Merger Consideration will be reduced ratably by the aggregate
amount distributed by the Operating Partnership to its partners per unit and
by Reckson to its stockholders per share in respect of such Designated
Properties. Any transfer Taxes, recording fees and other costs incurred by
Reckson or the relevant Reckson Subsidiary in connection with such transfer
of a Deeded Property shall be the responsibility of Parent. Parent agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Reckson and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, partners, members, employees, agents, and
representatives from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages,

necessary government approvals and licenses to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to have such approvals or licenses would not, individually or in

not subject to any preemptive rights, purchase options, call options, rights
of first refusal, subscriptions or any similar rights and are owned by Parent

constitute and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the failure to so comply,
individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute and would not

reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the
businesses of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are not being and have not
been conducted in violation of any Law or Order. No investigation or review

financial advisors, attorneys, brokers, finders and any other agents,
representatives or Affiliates to comply with this Section 5.5(a). Purchaser
Parties acknowledge that, effective as of the date of this Agreement, Reckson
waives all standstill or similar provisions of any agreement, letter or
understanding for the benefit of it or any of the Reckson Subsidiaries that
would in any way prohibit any Person from making or otherwise facilitate the
making of a proposal with respect to a Competing Transaction. Reckson shall
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of acquiring (whether by
merger, acquisition, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise) Reckson, the
Operating Partnership or any other Reckson Subsidiary, or any material
position of their assets, if any, to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Reckson,
the Operating Partnership or any other Reckson Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (b) Reckson and the Operating Partnership shall notify Purchaser of,
promptly following receipt, all relevant details relating to any proposal
(including the identity of the parties and all material terms thereof) which
any of Reckson, the Operating Partnership or any of the other Reckson
Subsidiaries or any such officer, director, employee, agent, investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, broker, finder or other representative
or Affiliate may receive after the date hereof relating to a Competing
Transaction and shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed on a prompt basis as
to the status of and any material developments regarding any such proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a " **Competing Transaction**
" means any of the following (other than the transactions expressly provided
for in this Agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving Reckson or the
Operating Partnership ; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of 40% or more of the fair market value of the
assets (including by means of

  



        
   

  



  

### an issuance, sale or other disposition of voting securities) of Reckson
and the Reckson Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of 40% or more of any
class of voting securities of Reckson, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, excluding any _bona_ _fide_ financing transactions
that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have as a purpose or effect
the sale or transfer of control of such assets; or (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for 40% or more of any class of voting securities of Reckson.

  

### 

  

### (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a " **Superior
Competing Transaction** " means a _bona_ _fide_ unsolicited written proposal
for a Competing Transaction made by a third party that the Reckson Board of
Directors determines (after taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement entered into or which Purchaser irrevocably covenants to enter
into and for which all internal approvals of Purchaser have been obtained
prior to the date of such determination), in good faith and after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is on terms that are more
favorable, taking into account financial terms, the conditions to the
consummation thereof and the likelihood of the Competing Transaction proposal
being consummated, to the Reckson Common Shareholders than the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.6. _Board Actions_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding Section 5.5 or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, following the receipt by Reckson or any Reckson Subsidiary
of a proposal from a third party for a Competing Transaction (which was not
solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section 5.5), if the
Reckson Board of Directors determines in good faith following consultation
with its legal and financial advisors that such proposal for a Competing
Transaction is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing
Transaction, the Reckson Board of Directors may (directly or through officers
or advisors) (i) furnish nonpublic information with respect to Reckson and
the Reckson Subsidiaries to the Person that made such proposal ( _provided_
that Reckson shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement unless the third party is already a party thereto), (ii) disclose
to Reckson shareholders any information required to be disclosed under
applicable Law, (iii) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding
such proposal and (iv) following receipt of a proposal for a Competing
Transaction that constitutes a Superior Competing Transaction, but prior to
the Reckson Shareholder Approval, (A) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Purchaser, or fail to make, the Reckson Recommendation or recommend that
the Reckson Common Shareholders approve such Superior Competing Transaction,
(B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject to compliance with,
Section 7.1(g) and (C) take any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders Reckson to take. Nothing in this Section 5.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Reckson Board of Directors from
complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
with respect to a Competing Transaction or from issuing a stop, look and
listen announcement or otherwise making any required disclosure to
Reckson shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Reckson Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law, including
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A; provided, however, that neither Reckson nor the Reckson Board of
Directors shall be permitted to recommend a Competing Transaction which is
not a Superior Competing Transaction.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) The Reckson Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clause (iv) of Section 5.6(a) (i) until at least three (3)
Business Days after giving notice to Purchaser that the Competing Transaction
constitutes a Superior Competing Transaction (a " **Superior Notice**
") accompanied by a copy of the form of definitive agreement (if any) that
is proposed to be entered into in respect of the Competing Transaction, and
(ii) unless the Reckson Board shall have concluded following the end of such
three (3) Business Day period that, taking into account any amendment to
this Agreement entered into or that Purchaser irrevocably covenants to enter
into and for which all internal approvals of Purchaser have been obtained
since receipt of such notice, in each case, prior to the end of such three
Business Day period, such Superior Competing Transaction remains a Superior
Competing Transaction.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.7. _Public Announcements_. Reckson, the Operating Partnership
and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement or filing without
the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement or filing as may be required by Law or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been
unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement or
filing is required to be released, filed or furnished pursuant to such Law.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.8. _Employee Arrangements_.

  

## 

  

### (a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary (or, if
earlier, such time as the Covered Employee is no longer employed by Purchaser
or its Affiliates) thereof (the " **Covered Period** "), Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide each employee of Reckson
and the Reckson Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who the Surviving
Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Purchaser Parties employ following
the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Covered Employees** ") with
employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits
and compensation plans, programs and arrangements (but for the avoidance of
doubt shall not be required to be replicated on a plan for plan or agreement
for agreement basis), excluding equity and equity-based plans and awards
of interests in the Operating Partnership provided by Reckson and the
Reckson Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to each such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, a Covered Employee
whose employment terminates during the Covered Period shall be entitled to
receive the severance payments and benefits provided under and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the severance policy described in Section
4.1(b) of the Reckson Disclosure Letter (without amendment on or after the
Effective Time). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Effective Time, the employment of the Covered Employees who are
covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall in all events be in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreements.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) provide the
Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility,
participation and vesting and levels of benefit accruals (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries), under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Purchaser, Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which (and to the extent)
such Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all periods of
employment with Reckson or any Reckson Subsidiary (or their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any welfare benefit plans of Purchaser, Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Covered
Employees and their eligible dependents, and (iii) give the Covered Employees
and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective
Time (or commencement of participation in a plan of Purchaser, Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries) occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to
the Effective Time (or the date of commencement of participation in a plan of
Purchaser, Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries).

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, take all action necessary to effectuate and satisfy, the
agreements and obligations set forth in Section 5.8(c) of the Reckson
Disclosure Letter.

### (d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to take the actions set forth in Section 5.8(d) of the

forth on such schedule.

## 

  

### (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which
any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a trustee, director or officer,
partner or member of Reckson or any of the Reckson Subsidiaries (each, an "
**Indemnified Party** " and collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties**
") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he
or she is or was a trustee, director, officer, partner or member of Reckson
or any of the Reckson Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of
Reckson or any of the Reckson Subsidiaries as a trustee, director, officer,
partner or member of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or
document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, from and after the Effective Time, the
Purchaser Parties and the Surviving Company (together with Reckson, the **"
Indemnitors** **"** ), shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, Liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (collectively, "
**Indemnifiable Amounts** "), and in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit,

  



        
   

  



  

### proceeding or investigation (whether asserted before or after the
Effective Time), the Indemnitors, shall promptly (but in any event within ten
(10) calendar days of written request) advance expenses pending the final
disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. For purposes of clarification, no person who is
a representative of any Joint Venture partner unaffiliated with Reckson on
any governing body of any Joint Venture shall be entitled to indemnification
as a result of this Section 5.9.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of the Purchaser Parties agrees that all rights to
indemnification and contribution existing in favor of, and all exculpations
and limitations of the personal liability of, the Indemnified Parties
provided for in the Reckson Charter or the Reckson Bylaws, as well as all
existing indemnification agreements with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Subject to Section 5.9 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, Reckson shall prior to the Effective Time
obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing coverage for the Indemnified
Parties) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
Recksons current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope no less favorable than Recksons
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent, Reckson and the Surviving Company. Each
of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 5.9.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case
may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.10. _Financing_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Purchaser Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

Financing Commitment, and to satisfy the conditions to obtaining the
financing set forth therein, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the financings contemplated by the Financing Commitment
(collectively, the " **Financing Agreements** "), so that the Financing
Agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable, and (iii) consummate the
financings contemplated by the Financing Agreements at or prior to the
Closing. The Purchaser Parties shall keep Reckson informed of the status of
the financing process relating thereto. Reckson shall provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser Parties in
connection with the financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Reckson shall
not be required to provide any such assistance that would unreasonably
interfere with the businesses or operations of Reckson; _provided,_  
_further_ , _however_ , that without Recksons

  



        
   

  



  

### consent, in no event, whether in connection with the
Financings contemplated by the Financing Agreements or otherwise, shall any
property-level due diligence involve environmental tests or assessments. The
Purchaser Parties shall indemnify Reckson and its Affiliates, including
without limitation its directors and officers, for any Liabilities incurred
by Reckson or its Affiliates, including without limitation its directors and
officers, that result from actions taken by Reckson or its Affiliates at the
request of the Purchaser Parties.

  

### 

  

### (b) If, notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts by the
Purchaser Parties to satisfy their obligations under this Section 5.10, any
of the Financing Commitment or Financing Agreements expire, are terminated or
otherwise become unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for
any reason, the Purchaser Parties shall (i) immediately notify Reckson of
such expiration, termination or other unavailability and the reasons therefor
and (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts promptly to arrange for
alternative financing to replace the Financing contemplated by such expired,
terminated or otherwise unavailable commitments or agreements in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.11. _Convertible Senior Notes_. Reckson and the Operating
Partnership shall, and shall cause the Reckson Subsidiaries to, reasonably
promptly after receipt of written instruction to do so by the Purchaser,
deliver a notice to the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes providing
that the Operating Partnership elects to change the exchange obligation under
the Convertible Senior Notes, subject to, conditioned upon, and after, the
consummation of the Mergers, into an obligation to deliver upon a subsequent
exchange of Convertible Senior Notes, cash, shares of Acquirer Common Stock
(as defined in the Officers Certificate setting forth the terms and
conditions of the Convertible Senior Notes), or a combination thereof in
accordance with Section 4.10 of such Officers Certificate.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.12. _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. The Purchaser Parties

allocation of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration) and all
other capitalized costs among the assets of Reckson in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate). Neither the
Purchaser Parties nor Reckson shall take any position for Tax purposes
(whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such
allocation, except to the extent required to do so by applicable law or
pursuant to a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code).
