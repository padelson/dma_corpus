that may be required in connection therewith in accordance with the following
sentence. Purchaser agrees that if any holder of Equity Interests of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than Seller, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) exercises any tag-along or similar contractual or legal
right to sell such Equity Interests, Purchaser will agree to acquire or
otherwise pay for such Equity Interests on the applicable contractual or other
legal terms and otherwise on substantially the same terms as set forth in

or indemnity with Seller, as beneficiary, shall remain in full force and

corresponding Guarantee shall remain in place.

(i) on or prior to the Closing Date, cause the applicable Company Subsidiary
to assign the obligations under the agreements set forth on _Schedule 5.18_
to Seller or one of its Affiliates, which shall assume such obligations, or
(ii) reimburse or cause one of its Affiliates to reimburse amounts paid by
the Company or such Company Subsidiary with respect to such obligations on or
after the Closing Date if such agreements are not assigned and assumed
pursuant to the foregoing _clause (i)_  of the prior sentence. In the latter
case, the reimbursement by Seller to Purchaser shall be made in immediately
available funds to the account designated by Purchaser, for all payments made

shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or
representatives, and following such termination no Party shall have any
liability under this Agreement or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any other Party; _provided_ that if this
Agreement is terminated by a Party because of a breach of this Agreement by
the other Party then no such termination shall relieve the other Party from
liability for fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any material
provision of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided in _Section 7.1_, Purchaser shall
redeliver to Seller or the Company, as the case may be, and will cause its
agents to redeliver to Seller or the Company, as the case may be, all
documents, workpapers and other materials of Seller, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries relating to any of them and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof,
and Purchaser shall comply with all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.   

ARTICLE VIII    

 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_     

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements;
Exclusive Remedy_.   

(a) The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and shall terminate and expire on the date which is the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (" _Survival Period Termination Date_ ") and
shall not constitute after such date the basis for any claim
for indemnification under this Agreement, except for:    

(i) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Sections 2.2_
( _Title to Shares_ ) and _2.3(a)_ ( _Authority_ ), that shall
survive indefinitely;    

(ii) the representations and warranties of the Seller with respect to
the Company contained in _Sections 3.1(a)_ ( _Organization and
Qualification_ ),  _3.1(b)_ ( _Authority_ ) and _3.2_ ( _Capitalization_ ),
that shall survive indefinitely;    

(iii) the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in
_Sections 4.2(a)_ ( _Authority_ ) and _4.8_ ( _No Knowledge of Seller or
Company Breach_ ), that shall survive indefinitely; and    

(iv) the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in _Sections 5.3_
( _Access_ ), _5.7_ ( _Fees and Expenses_ ), _5.10_ ( _Further Assurances_ ),
_5.12_ ( _Change of Name_ ), _5.16_ ( _Releases of Certain Guarantees_ ) and
_7.2_ ( _Effect of Termination_ ) and _Article VIII_ ( _Indemnification_ )
that shall survive according with their terms.   

(b) The Parties agree that, from and after the Closing Date to and including
the date on which such claim or cause of action against any of the Parties is
based upon, directly or indirectly, a breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement may be
brought only, as expressly provided in, this _Article VIII_, and
the indemnification provided for in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy (except in the case of fraud) for Losses related to or
in connection with such breach.   

8.2 _Indemnification of Purchaser by Seller_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article VIII_, and except when the Loss arises from
Purchasers negligence or willful misconduct or the matters contemplated by
_Section 8.5_, from and after the Closing Date the Seller shall, subject to
_Section 8.4_, indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and each of Purchasers
Affiliates, directors, officers and employees and the successors and assigns
of any of them (including, without limitation, the Company) (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Group_ ") harmless from and against all Losses, arising from
any claim resulting from, imposed upon or incurred by any member of the
Purchaser Group, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any
misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Seller contained in or made pursuant to _Articles II_ or _III_ of this
Agreement and/or any breach by Seller of any of its covenants, agreements or
obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement. Payments to
Purchaser under this _Section 8.2_ shall be made in _reais_ , calculated at
the exchange rate on the date or dates Seller makes payment or payments to
Purchaser.   

8.3 _Indemnification of Seller by Purchaser_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article VIII_, and except when the Loss arises from
Sellers negligence or willful misconduct, from and after the Closing Date
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (the " _Seller Group_ ") harmless from and against all Losses
arising from any claim resulting from, imposed upon or incurred by Seller,
directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any misrepresentation
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
or made pursuant to _Article IV_ of this Agreement; and/or any breach by
Purchaser of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations of Purchaser
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the matters contemplated by the proviso of the last sentence of 
_Section 5.7_). Payments to Seller under this _Section 8.3_ shall be made in
U.S. currency, calculated at the exchange rate on the date or dates Purchaser
makes payment or payments to Seller or any other member of the Seller
Group.   

8.4 _Limitations on Seller s Indemnification_.   

(a) _Limitations_. Claims for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ shall be
made by Purchaser or by any other Person of the Purchaser Group in accordance
with the following limits:    

(i) if such claim involves Losses equal to or in excess of US$50,000 (the "
_Mini-Basket Amount_ "); and    

(ii) if such Losses with respect to the claims permitted to be made pursuant
to the foregoing _clause (i)_ exceed in the aggregate an amount equal
to US$500,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and then only to the extent
such Losses exceed the Deductible Amount.   

(b) _Losses Below the Deductible Amount_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this  _Section 8.4_, if claims made prior to the Survival Period Termination
Date do not reach the Deductible Amount, Seller agrees to pay to Purchaser
the aggregate amount of the Losses related to such claims meeting the Mini-
Basket Amount definition and made until the Survival Period Termination
Date.   

(c) _Indemnification Cap_. The aggregate amount of Losses payable by Seller
under this Agreement shall not exceed US$10,000,000 (the " _Indemnification
Cap_ ") in the aggregate.   

(d) _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under  _Section 8.2_ or _8.3_ shall be calculated net of any
insurance proceeds (net of direct collection expenses, deductibles and co-
pays) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by
Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto. To the extent a Loss
is reasonably expected to be covered by such policies, Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under its insurance policies
covering such Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 8.4(d)_ shall prevent Indemnitee from also seeking to
recover such Loss from Indemnitor while such insurance claim is pending. In
the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by Indemnitee with
respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder,
then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (not to
exceed the amount of the applicable indemnification payment made to it) shall
be made promptly to Seller. Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all rights of
Indemnitee and its Affiliates in respect of any Losses indemnified by
Indemnitor.   

8.5 _Special Indemnification by Seller_.   

(a) _General_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, from and after the
Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser against and hold it harmless
from any Losses that result from or arise out of the matters set forth on
_Schedule 8.5(a)_, which shall be excluded from the Sellers
indemnification obligations and limits under _Sections 8.2_, _8.4(a)_ ,
_8.4(b)_ and  _8.4(c)_.   

(b) _Special Seller Indemnification Cap_. In no event shall the aggregate
amount of Losses payable by Seller under _Section 8.5_ exceed US$8,800,000
(the " _Special Seller Indemnification Cap_ ") in the aggregate.   

(c) _Expiration_. With respect to the claim noted in item 4 of _Schedule
8.5(a)_, the Sellers obligations under this _Section 8.5(c)_ shall expire
on October 27, 2009, unless a Third Party Claim (as defined in _Section
8.7(a)_) based on a Promissory Note is made with respect thereto prior to
such date; _provided_ that, if the enforceability of such a Promissory Note
is tolled prior to the making of such Third Party Claim, the expiration date
of Sellers obligation with respect to such Promissory Note under this
_Section 8.5(c)_ shall be extended for a number of days equal to the number
of days during which such enforceability was tolled. With respect to the
other matters noted in _Schedule 8.5(a)_, Sellers obligations under this
_Section 8.5(c)_ shall expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the Closing
Date.   

(d) _Payments_. Payments to Purchaser under this _Section 8.5_ shall be made
in  _reais_ , calculated at the exchange rate on the date or dates Seller
makes payment or payments to Purchaser.   

8.6 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming
aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss
that is subject to indemnification hereunder.   

8.7 _General Procedures Applicable to Claims for Indemnification_.   

(a) _Third Party Claim_. Any request for indemnification by a party under
this  _Article VIII_ shall be valid only if the party making the request ("
_Indemnitee_ ") notifies the other party in writing (" _Indemnitor_ ") as
promptly as reasonably practicable by written notice in accordance with
_Section 10.1_ regarding a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a
Party or Affiliate thereof) (" _Third Party Claim_ "). Notice shall specify
the nature of the Third Party Claim, the applicable provision(s) of this
Agreement under which the Third Party Claim arises and, if possible, the
amount of, or an estimated amount of, the Loss and such other information as
Indemnitor may reasonably request. No failure or delay in giving a Third
Party Claim Notice and no failure to include any specific information or
any reference to any provision of this Agreement or other instrument under
which the Third Party Claim arises shall affect the rights of Indemnitee
hereunder, except to the extent that such failure or delay materially
adversely affects the ability of Indemnitor to defend, settle or satisfy the
Third Party Claim.   

(b) _Right of Indemnitor to Assume Defense of Claim; Control of the
Defense_. Indemnitor, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right,
upon written notice to Indemnitee to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim if in such written notice Indemnitor acknowledges in writing that the
Third Party Claim is covered by the indemnification obligations under this 
_Article VIII_ and all Losses incurred by Indemnitor shall be included in the
calculation of the maximum amount of indemnification set forth in _Section
8.4(c)_. If Indemnitor assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, it shall
select reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee to conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim and shall defend or settle the same.
The contest of the Third Party Claim may be conducted in the name and on
behalf of Indemnitor or Indemnitee, as the case may be appropriate. If
Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim, Indemnitor shall have full
authority, in consultation with Indemnitee, to determine all action to be
taken with respect to the Third Party Claim, except that Indemnitor may
consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any monetary
judgment arising from, the Third Party Claim only with the prior written
consent of Indemnitee provided that, the proposed settlement, compromise
or entry: (A) does not contain an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the
part of Indemnitee, and (B) does not provide for any remedy or sanction
against Indemnitee other than the payment of money that is required to be and
is timely paid by Indemnitor. Should Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim, Indemnitor will not be liable to
Indemnitee for legal expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof, unless the Third Party Claim involves
potential conflicts of interest between Indemnitee and Indemnitor. Indemnitor
will be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by Indemnitee
for any period during which Indemnitor has not assumed the defense
thereof.   

(c) _Cooperation in Defense_. If requested by Indemnitor, Indemnitee shall
cooperate with Indemnitor and its counsel, including permitting reasonable
access to books and records, in contesting any Third Party Claim that
Indemnitor elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim
against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint
against any Person, but Indemnitor shall reimburse Indemnitee for reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating. With respect to
any claims arising out or relating to _Section 8.5_ , Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Seller with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by Seller in connection with any indemnification or
defense with respect to the matters provided for in _Section 8.5_,
including, without limitation, providing Seller with such information,
documents and records and reasonable access to the services of and
consultations with such personnel of Purchaser or its Affiliates as Seller
shall deem reasonably necessary.   

(d) _Failure of Indemnitor to Assume Defense_. If Indemnitor does not inform
Indemnitee in writing that it will assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms hereof within one third of the legal term
for defense or five (5) calendar days, whichever is less, after the receipt
of notice thereof, Indemnitee may, but not in any means shall be obliged to,
at Indemnitors sole expense, defend against the Third Party Claim in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, and the expense of such defense shall
constitute an indemnifiable Loss, which amounts shall be included in the
calculation of the maximum amount of indemnification set forth in  _Section
8.4(c)_. Indemnitor shall have the right, and Indemnitee shall use its
reasonable efforts to afford Indemnitor, to have its counsel attend, observe
and participate in all administrative and judicial meetings, conferences,
hearings and other proceedings in connection with such defense and to be
provided with copies of, or reasonable access to, all pleadings, notices and
other filings in connection with such defense.   

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. In the event that Indemnitee should have a claim
against Indemnitor under this _Article VIII_, Indemnitee shall notify
Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of such claim as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including (i) the reason why Indemnitee believes that
Indemnitor is or will be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee, (ii) the Loss
amount and (iii) the basis on which Indemnitee has calculated such Loss amount
(such notice shall be referred to as the " _Notice of Claim_ "). If, within
twenty (20) Business Days upon receipt of the Notice of Claim, Indemnitor
does not deliver a notice in writing disputing in good faith such Notice of
Claim, then Indemnitor shall be deemed to have accepted such claim and
the Loss amount as final and binding without amendment or modification and
conclusive upon the parties. For ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of
the Notice of Claim, Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall use reasonable efforts
to engage in negotiations and discussions relating to any matters arising out
of or concerning the Notice of Claim. If Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall fail
to resolve any such dispute during the 10-Business Day period, then the claim
in dispute shall be promptly submitted by Indemnitor (in any event, no later
than five (5) Business Days after the 10-Business Day period) to the Panel in
accordance with _Section 10.9_ of this Agreement. Indemnitor and Indemnitee
shall make readily available to the Panel all relevant books and
records, notices and documents, and all other items reasonably requested by
the Panel. _Section 10.9_ shall govern the resolution of disagreements among
the Parties under this _Article VIII_.   

8.8 _Payment_. Indemnitor shall reimburse Indemnitee for Losses incurred no
later than ten (10) days after the final resolution of a Notice of Claim in
accordance with _Section 8.7(e)_ or, with respect to Losses in relation to
Third Party Claims (other than on-going out-of-pocket costs and expenses with
respect thereto), ten (10) days after Indemnitor receives written notice from
Indemnitee reasonably describing the Loss being claimed (" _Loss
Payment Date_ "). Failure to comply with the Loss Payment Date shall cause
the Loss amount to be duly adjusted by IGP-M, plus interest of one percent
(1%) per month with respect to Losses paid in  _reais_.   

8.9 _Energy Guarantee_.   

(a) For value received, Energy hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees from and after the Closing Date (the " _Energy Guarantee_ ") to
Purchaser the prompt and punctual payment of any amount Seller is required to
pay under this Agreement, when and as the same shall become due and payable,
subject as to such payment obligations to the terms and conditions of this 
_Article VIII_. Energys guarantee obligations include the principal,
interest, fines, fees, costs and other amounts that may be due and payable by
Seller under this Agreement.   

(b) The Energy Guarantee is a first demand guarantee and shall constitute an
autonomous and independent obligation of Energy not being ancillary to the
obligations of Seller under this Agreement. Energy hereby agrees to cause any
such payment to be made as if such payment were made by Seller. Energy hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with
a court in the event of a merger or bankruptcy of Seller, any right to
require a proceeding first against Seller, protest or notice with respect to
any amount payable by Seller under this Agreement and all demands whatsoever,
and covenants that the Energy Guarantee will not be discharged except by (i)
termination of this Agreement according to its terms, (ii) termination or
expiration of Sellers indemnification obligations under this Agreement or
(iii) payment in full of all amounts due and payable under this
Agreement.   

(c) Energy expressly waives the benefits set forth in Articles 366, 827, 835,
837, 838 and 839 of the Brazilian Civil Code and Article 595 of the Brazilian
Code of Civil Procedure.   

(d) The applicability of the Energy Guarantee shall not be affected or
impaired by any of the following: (i) any extension of time, forbearance or
concession given to Seller; (ii) any assertion of, or failure to assert, or
delay in asserting, any right, power or remedy against Seller; (iii) any
amendment of the provisions of this Agreement; (iv) any failure of Seller
to comply with any requirement of any Law; (v) the dissolution, liquidation,
reorganization or any other alteration of the legal structure of Seller; (vi)
any invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement; or
(vii) any other circumstance (other than complete payment by Seller or
Energy) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a surety or a guarantor.   

(e) Energy shall be subrogated to all rights of Seller against Purchaser based
on and to the extent of any amounts paid to Purchaser by Energy pursuant to
the provisions of the Energy Guarantee.   

(f) All notices under this _Article VIII_ from Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser Group shall be given to Seller and Energy concurrently.

9.2 _Definitions_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
or unless the context otherwise requires, whenever used in this Agreement,
the following terms will have the meanings indicated below:    

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person or group of Persons, a
Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person or
group of Persons. " _Control_ " (including the terms "controlled by" and
"under common control with") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of a
Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities or other
Equity Interests, by contract or credit arrangement, as trustee or executor,
or otherwise. Solely for the purpose of the preceding sentence, a company is
"directly controlled" by another company or companies holding shares carrying
the majority of votes exercisable at a general meeting (or its equivalent) of
the first mentioned company; and a particular company is "indirectly
controlled" by a company or companies (hereinafter called the "parent company

were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that Seller
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to
any other remedies at law or in equity.

permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights
