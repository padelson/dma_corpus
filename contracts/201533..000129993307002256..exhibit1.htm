<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.4 <U>Limitations on Seller&#146;s Indemnification</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Limitations</U>. Claims for indemnification under <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> shall be made
by Purchaser or by any other Person of the Purchaser Group in accordance with the following limits:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;if such claim involves Losses equal to or in excess of US$50,000 (the
&#147;<U>Mini-Basket Amount</U>&#148;); and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(ii)&nbsp;if such Losses with respect to the claims permitted to be made pursuant to
the foregoing <U>clause (i)</U> exceed in the aggregate an amount equal to
US$500,000 (the &#147;<U>Deductible Amount</U>&#148;), and then only to the extent such
Losses exceed the Deductible Amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Losses Below the Deductible Amount</U>. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.4</U>, if claims made prior to the Survival Period Termination Date do not reach the
Deductible Amount, Seller agrees to pay to Purchaser the aggregate amount of the Losses related to
such claims meeting the Mini-Basket Amount definition and made until the Survival Period
Termination Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Indemnification Cap</U>. The aggregate amount of Losses payable by Seller under this
Agreement shall not exceed US$10,000,000 (the &#147;<U>Indemnification Cap</U>&#148;) in the aggregate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Calculation of Losses</U>. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under
<U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> or <U>8.3</U> shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (net of direct
collection expenses, deductibles and co-pays) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment received by Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto. To the extent a Loss is
reasonably expected to be covered by such policies, Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover under its insurance policies covering such Loss to the same extent as they would
if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.4(d)</U> shall prevent Indemnitee from also seeking to recover such
Loss from Indemnitor while such insurance claim is pending. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (not to exceed
the amount of the applicable indemnification payment made to it) shall be made promptly to Seller.
Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all rights of Indemnitee and its Affiliates in respect of any
Losses indemnified by Indemnitor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.5 <U>Special Indemnification by Seller</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>General</U>. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated hereby, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify
Purchaser against and hold it harmless from any Losses that result from or arise out of the matters
set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;8.5(a)</U>, which shall be excluded from the Seller&#146;s indemnification
obligations and limits under <U>Sections&nbsp;8.2</U>, <U>8.4(a)</U>, <U>8.4(b)</U> and
<U>8.4(c)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Special Seller Indemnification Cap</U>. In no event shall the aggregate amount of
Losses payable by Seller under <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U> exceed US$8,800,000 (the &#147;<U>Special Seller
Indemnification Cap</U>&#148;) in the aggregate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Expiration</U>. With respect to the claim noted in item 4 of <U>Schedule&nbsp;8.5(a)</U>,
the Seller&#146;s obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(c)</U> shall expire on October&nbsp;27, 2009, unless
a Third Party Claim (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;8.7(a)</U>) based on a Promissory Note is made with
respect thereto prior to such date; <U>provided</U> that, if the enforceability of such a
Promissory Note is tolled prior to the making of such Third Party Claim, the expiration date of
Seller&#146;s obligation with respect to such Promissory Note under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(c)</U> shall be
extended for a number of days equal to the number of days during which such enforceability was
tolled. With respect to the other matters noted in <U>Schedule&nbsp;8.5(a)</U>, Seller&#146;s obligations
under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(c)</U> shall expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Payments</U>. Payments to Purchaser under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U> shall be made in
<I>reais</I>, calculated at the exchange rate on the date or dates Seller makes payment or payments to
Purchaser.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.6 <U>Mitigation</U>. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss that is subject to indemnification hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.7 <U>General Procedures Applicable to Claims for Indemnification</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Third Party Claim</U>. Any request for indemnification by a party under this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> shall be valid only if the party making the request (&#147;<U>Indemnitee</U>&#148;)
notifies the other party in writing (&#147;<U>Indemnitor</U>&#148;) as promptly as reasonably practicable by
written notice in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10.1</U> regarding a claim or demand made by any
Person (other than a Party or Affiliate thereof) (&#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;). Notice shall
specify the nature of the Third Party Claim, the applicable provision(s) of this Agreement under
which the Third Party Claim arises and, if possible, the amount of, or an estimated amount of, the
Loss and such other information as Indemnitor may reasonably request. No failure or delay in
giving a Third Party Claim Notice and no failure to include any specific information or any
reference to any provision of this Agreement or other instrument under which the Third Party Claim
arises shall affect the rights of Indemnitee hereunder, except to the extent that such failure or
delay materially adversely affects the ability of Indemnitor to defend, settle or satisfy the Third
Party Claim.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Right of Indemnitor to Assume Defense of Claim; Control of the Defense</U>.
Indemnitor, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right, upon written notice to Indemnitee
to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if in such written notice Indemnitor acknowledges in
writing that the Third Party Claim is covered by the indemnification obligations under this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> and all Losses incurred by Indemnitor shall be included in the calculation of
the maximum amount of indemnification set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.4(c)</U>. If Indemnitor assumes
the defense of the Third Party Claim, it shall select reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim and shall defend or settle the same. The
contest of the Third Party Claim may be conducted in the name and on behalf of Indemnitor or
Indemnitee, as the case may be appropriate. If Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim,
Indemnitor shall have full authority, in consultation with Indemnitee, to determine all action to
be taken with respect to the Third Party Claim, except that Indemnitor may consent to a settlement
or compromise of, or the entry of any monetary judgment arising from, the Third Party Claim only
with the prior written consent of Indemnitee provided that, the proposed settlement, compromise or
entry: (A)&nbsp;does not contain an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of Indemnitee, and (B)
does not provide for any remedy or sanction against Indemnitee other than the payment of money that
is required to be and is timely paid by Indemnitor. Should Indemnitor so elect to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, Indemnitor will not be liable to Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof, unless the Third Party
Claim involves potential conflicts of interest between Indemnitee and Indemnitor. Indemnitor will
be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by Indemnitee for any period during which
Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Cooperation in Defense</U>. If requested by Indemnitor, Indemnitee shall cooperate
with Indemnitor and its counsel, including permitting reasonable access to books and records, in
contesting any Third Party Claim that Indemnitor elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making
any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against
any Person, but Indemnitor shall reimburse Indemnitee for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Indemnitee in so cooperating. With respect to any claims arising out or relating to <U>Section
8.5</U>, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Seller with such assistance as
may reasonably be requested by Seller in connection with any indemnification or defense with
respect to the matters provided for in <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U>, including, without limitation,
providing Seller with such information, documents and records and reasonable access to the services
of and consultations with such personnel of Purchaser or its Affiliates as Seller shall deem
reasonably necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Failure of Indemnitor to Assume Defense</U>. If Indemnitor does not inform Indemnitee
in writing that it will assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms
hereof within one third of the legal term for defense or five (5)&nbsp;calendar days, whichever is less,
after the receipt of notice thereof, Indemnitee may, but not in any means shall be obliged to, at
Indemnitor&#146;s sole expense, defend against the Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, and the expense of such defense shall constitute an indemnifiable Loss, which amounts
shall be included in the calculation of the maximum amount of indemnification set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;8.4(c)</U>. Indemnitor shall have the right, and Indemnitee shall use its reasonable
efforts to afford Indemnitor, to have its counsel attend, observe and participate in all
administrative and judicial meetings, conferences, hearings and other proceedings in connection
with such defense and to be provided with copies of, or reasonable access to, all pleadings,
notices and other filings in connection with such defense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Dispute Resolution</U>. In the event that Indemnitee should have a claim against
Indemnitor under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, Indemnitee shall notify Indemnitor in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of such claim as promptly as reasonably practicable, including (i)&nbsp;the reason
why Indemnitee believes that Indemnitor is or will be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee, (ii)&nbsp;the
Loss amount and (iii)&nbsp;the basis on which Indemnitee has calculated such Loss amount (such notice
shall be referred to as the &#147;<U>Notice of Claim</U>&#148;). If, within twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days upon
receipt of the Notice of Claim, Indemnitor does not deliver a notice in writing disputing in good
faith such Notice of Claim, then Indemnitor shall be deemed to have accepted such claim and the
Loss amount as final and binding without amendment or modification and conclusive upon the parties.
For ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after the receipt of the Notice of Claim, Indemnitor and Indemnitee
shall use reasonable efforts to engage in negotiations and discussions relating to any matters
arising out of or concerning the Notice of Claim. If Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall fail to
resolve any such dispute during the 10-Business Day period, then the claim in dispute shall be
promptly submitted by Indemnitor (in any event, no later than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after the
10-Business Day period) to the Panel in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10.9</U> of this Agreement.
Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall make readily available to the Panel all relevant books and records,
notices and documents, and all other items reasonably requested by the Panel. <U>Section&nbsp;10.9</U>
shall govern the resolution of disagreements among the Parties under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.8 <U>Payment</U>. Indemnitor shall reimburse Indemnitee for Losses incurred no later than
ten (10)&nbsp;days after the final resolution of a Notice of Claim in accordance with <U>Section
8.7(e)</U> or, with respect to Losses in relation to Third Party Claims (other than on-going
out-of-pocket costs and expenses with respect thereto), ten (10)&nbsp;days after Indemnitor receives
written notice from Indemnitee reasonably describing the Loss being claimed (&#147;<U>Loss Payment
Date</U>&#148;). Failure to comply with the Loss Payment Date shall cause the Loss amount to be duly
adjusted by IGP-M, plus interest of one percent (1%) per month with respect to Losses paid in
<I>reais</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.9 <U>Energy Guarantee</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;For value received, Energy hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees from
and after the Closing Date (the &#147;<U>Energy Guarantee</U>&#148;) to Purchaser the prompt and punctual
payment of any amount Seller is required to pay under this Agreement, when and as the same shall
become due and payable, subject as to such payment obligations to the terms and conditions of this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>. Energy&#146;s guarantee obligations include the principal, interest, fines, fees,
costs and other amounts that may be due and payable by Seller under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The Energy Guarantee is a first demand guarantee and shall constitute an autonomous and
independent obligation of Energy not being ancillary to the obligations of Seller under this
Agreement. Energy hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made as if such payment were made
by Seller. Energy hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a
court in the event of a merger or bankruptcy of Seller, any right to require a proceeding first
against Seller, protest or notice with respect to any amount payable by Seller under this Agreement
and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that the Energy Guarantee will not be discharged except
by (i)&nbsp;termination of this Agreement according to its terms, (ii)&nbsp;termination or expiration of
Seller&#146;s indemnification obligations under this Agreement or (iii)&nbsp;payment in full of all amounts
due and payable under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Energy expressly waives the benefits set forth in Articles 366, 827, 835, 837, 838 and 839
of the Brazilian Civil Code and Article&nbsp;595 of the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;The applicability of the Energy Guarantee shall not be affected or impaired by any of the
following: (i)&nbsp;any extension of time, forbearance or concession given to Seller; (ii)&nbsp;any
assertion of, or failure to assert, or delay in asserting, any right, power or remedy against
Seller; (iii)&nbsp;any amendment of the provisions of this Agreement; (iv)&nbsp;any failure of Seller to
comply with any requirement of any Law; (v)&nbsp;the dissolution, liquidation, reorganization or any
other alteration of the legal structure of Seller; (vi)&nbsp;any invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement; or (vii)&nbsp;any other circumstance (other than complete payment by Seller
or Energy) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety
or a guarantor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Energy shall be subrogated to all rights of Seller against Purchaser based on and to the
extent of any amounts paid to Purchaser by Energy pursuant to the provisions of the Energy
Guarantee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;All notices under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> from Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser
Group shall be given to Seller and Energy concurrently.
