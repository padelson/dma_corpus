AGREEMENT

 

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1  PURCHASE AND SALE OF PURCHASED UNITS; CLOSING

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Purchased Units. At the Closing, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer, and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Seller, the Purchased Units, free and clear of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens. 1.2 Consideration. The total consideration to be paid by Buyer to Seller at
the Closing for the sale, assignment, transfer, and conveyance of the
Purchased Units shall be (a) cash in an aggregate amount of $600,000,000 (the
"Base Cash Purchase Price"), plus (b) 9,791,605 CHKM Common Units
(the "Common Unit Consideration and, together with the Base Cash Purchase
Price, the "Base Total Consideration"). The securities making up the Common
Unit Consideration will be issued to Chesapeake Midstream Holdings, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Seller
("Chesapeake Holdings"). The Base Cash Purchase Price is subject to adjustment
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (such adjusted Base Cash Purchase Price, together

Consideration to Seller and (ii) pay the Base Cash Purchase Price to Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire
transfer instructions delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the Closing.

1.3 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall take place at a closing
(the "Closing") to be held at the offices of Seller promptly following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the Parties set
forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions), or at such other place or time or on such other date as may
be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller (the date upon which the Closing
actually occurs, the "Closing Date"); _provided, however_ , that the Parties
agree that the Contemplated Transactions, including the transfer of ownership
of the Purchased Units, will be effective as of the Effective Time.

1.4 Closing Deliveries.

(a) At the Closing, the Seller Parties shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer:

(i) an assignment, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the "Unit Assignment"), evidencing the assignment and transfer to Buyer of
the Purchased Units and the admission of Buyer as a member of the Company,
which shall have been duly executed by Seller; 

(ii) a certificate in the form prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2) to the effect that Seller is not a foreign person;

(iii) a good standing certificate (or equivalent document), dated within 5
Business Days of the Closing, for each Seller Party issued by the Secretary of
State of the jurisdiction in which such Seller Party was formed or organized;

 



-2-  (iv) a certificate of each Seller Party signed by an officer of such
Seller Party (1) certifying that the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ with respect to each Seller Party has been satisfied and
(2) certifying and attaching all requisite resolutions or actions of the board
of directors, general partner or member of such Seller Party approving the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, including the removal of each of the officers and
managers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and
appointment of new officers of the Company as of the Effective Time;

 

(v) all of the Consents listed on _Schedule 1.4(a)(v)_ ;

 

(vi) a Marketing and Non-Compete Agreement, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Marketing Agreement"), duly executed by the
Affiliates of the Seller Parties that are parties thereto; and

(vii) such other documents and instruments that are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions and requested by Buyer.

 

(b) Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller:

 

(i) a cash amount equal to the Base Cash Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) specified in the wire
transaction instructions delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the Closing;

(ii) counterparts to the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) to
which Buyer is a party, duly executed by Buyer;

(iii) a good standing certificate (or equivalent document), dated within 5
Business Days of the Closing, for Buyer issued by the secretary of State of
Delaware;

 

(iv) a certificate of Buyer signed by an officer of Buyer (1) certifying that
the conditions set forth in  _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ with respect to
Buyer have been satisfied and (2) certifying and attaching all requisite
resolutions or actions of the sole member of Buyer approving the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions; and

(v) such other documents and instruments that are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions and requested by Seller.

(c) CHKM shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Chesapeake Holdings the
Common Unit Consideration by issuing or causing its transfer agent to issue
certificates (or other evidence of ownership) for the applicable CHKM Common
Units to Chesapeake Holdings, subject to applicable federal and state
securities Laws.

 



-3-  1.5 Net Working Capital Threshold. The Parties acknowledge that the Base
Total Consideration has been based in part on the Company having a Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time equal to $47 million (the "Net
Working Capital Threshold"). Attached hereto as _Schedule 1.5_ is (a) an
estimated balance sheet of the Company as of November 30, 2011, which balance
sheet has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as set forth on
_Schedule 1.5_ (the "Estimated Balance Sheet"), and (b) a schedule with a
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Company as of November 30, 2011
(the "Estimated NWC Schedule").

1.6 Net Working Capital Adjustment Procedure.

(a) For the purpose of confirming the Net Working Capital Threshold,
Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, (i) a balance sheet of the
Company as of the Effective Time, which balance sheet shall be prepared in
substantially the same manner as the Estimated Balance Sheet (the "Final
Balance Sheet") and (ii) a schedule with a calculation of the Net Working
Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Final Net Working
Capital"), which schedule shall be prepared in substantially the same manner
as the Estimated NWC Schedule (the "Final NWC Schedule") and which Final Net
Working Capital shall be calculated in substantially the same manner as the
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Company as of November 30,
2011 in the Estimated NWC Schedule.

(b) No later than 90 days after the Effective Time (or such later date
as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), Buyer shall deliver to Seller the
Final Balance Sheet and the Final NWC Schedule, including a worksheet showing
the difference, if any, between the Final Net Working Capital and the Net
Working Capital Threshold. If Buyer does not deliver the Final Balance Sheet
and Final NWC Schedule in accordance with this _Section 1.6(b)_ on or before
the 90th day after the Effective Time (or such later date as mutually agreed
by Buyer and Seller), Seller shall have the right to prepare the Final
Balance Sheet and Final NWC Schedule on or before the 120th day after the
Effective Time (or such later date as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), in
which case the relative obligations of Buyer and Seller in the remainder of
this _Section 1.6_ shall be switched. Buyer and Seller shall promptly provide
to each other all documents reasonably requested by the other to verify any of
the elements of working capital set forth in the Final Balance Sheet and
Final NWC Schedule.

(c) Within 30 days after receipt by Seller of the Final Balance Sheet and
Final NWC Schedule (the "Initial Review Period"), Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing as to whether Seller agrees or disagrees with the Final Net Working
Capital set forth on the Final NWC Schedule and, if Seller disagrees, such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement, including the calculation by Seller of the Final Net Working
Capital ("Notice of Disagreement"). If Seller provides a notice pursuant to
which it agrees with each of the components of the Final Balance Sheet and the
Final NWC Schedule or does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such
30-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have accepted all of the amounts
set forth in the Final Balance Sheet and the Final NWC Schedule, which shall
then be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If a Notice
of Disagreement is timely provided, then Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days thereafter to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the amounts identified in the Notice of
Disagreement. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in the Notice
of Disagreement shall be final, conclusive, and binding. 

 



-4-  (d) If, at the end of the 30 day resolution period, Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in a Notice of
Disagreement, then Deloitte LLP (or such other nationally-recognized
independent accounting firm as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller)
shall be appointed as an expert to resolve any remaining disagreements, but
in no case shall Deloitte LLP review or propose any resolution for any matters
that have not been raised in the Notice of Disagreement. If Deloitte LLP is
unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity and Buyer and Seller are not
able to mutually select an alternative independent accounting firm that is
willing and able to serve in such capacity, then Buyer shall within 10 days
deliver to Seller a listing of 3 other nationally-recognized firms and Seller
shall within 10 days after receipt of such list, select one of such 3 firms
(such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant to the aforementioned procedures
being the "Dispute Resolution Expert"). The Dispute Resolution Expert
shall be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within 30 days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the
Dispute Resolution Expert, any unresolved disputed items required to determine
the Final Net Working Capital. In resolving any such dispute:

(i) each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the Dispute Resolution Expert
such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Dispute Resolution Expert may request and are reasonably
available to that Party (or its independent public accountants) and shall be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Dispute Resolution Expert any
material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to
discuss such determination with the Dispute Resolution Expert;

 

(ii) the Dispute Resolution Expert may not adopt an amount for Final Net
Working Capital that is less than the lowest amount proposed by either Buyer
or Seller or greater than the highest amount proposed by either Buyer or
Seller;

 

(iii) the determination of the Dispute Resolution Expert shall be final,
binding, and conclusive for all purposes hereunder; and

(iv) all fees and costs of the Dispute Resolution Expert shall be paid 50% by

Companys business in substantially the same manner as is currently being

ARTICLE 5  TAX MATTERS

5.1 Payment of Taxes. Seller shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company for a Pre-Effective Time Tax Period. Seller
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for all Liabilities incurred
for, arising out of, or relating to any Taxes incurred or paid with respect to
the Company and the Assets for any Pre-Effective Time Tax Period to the extent
such Taxes are not actually taken into account in the calculation of the
Final Net Working Capital. Buyer shall file all other Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Company and shall pay all other Taxes owed.
In the case of any Tax period that includes but does not end on the Effective
Time (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any Taxes, other than property
Taxes (which shall be allocated between the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period and
the Post-Effective Time Tax Period in accordance with  _Section 5.4_),
allocable to the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period shall be determined from the
books and records of the Company or its Affiliates, as applicable, as though
the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on the
day prior to the Effective Time. Buyer and Seller shall each provide the other
with all information reasonably necessary to prepare a Tax Return. The
indemnification procedures set forth in _Section 8.5_ shall apply to
the indemnification provided in this _Section 5.1_.

5.2 Allocation of Total Consideration. The Total Consideration represents the
amount agreed upon by Buyer and Seller to be the aggregate fair market value
of the Purchased Units. The Total Consideration shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, based
upon the fair market value of such assets. Such Total Consideration allocation
shall be agreed upon and memorialized in a schedule on or prior to the
Closing Date. Seller and Buyer agree to file all required Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594 and any amended Tax Returns or claims for refund) in
a manner consistent with the Total Consideration allocation agreed upon under
this _Section 5.2_ and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position
inconsistent with such allocation on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless
required to do so by Applicable Law or a "determination", within the meaning
of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code. The Total Consideration allocation may be
revised, from time to time, by a mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer,
to reflect any matters that require updating (including Total Consideration
adjustments, if any).

 

5.3 Responsibility for Tax Audits and Contests. Seller shall control any audit
or contest with respect to a Pre-Effective Time Tax Period and Buyer shall
control any other audit or contest; _provided, however_ , that the Party with
the greater potential Tax Liability shall control any audit or contest with
respect to a Straddle Period. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall settle any

 



-25-   audit or contest in a way that would adversely affect the other Party
without the other Partys written consent, which the other Party shall not
unreasonably withhold. Buyer and Seller shall each provide the other with all
information reasonably necessary to conduct an audit or contest with respect
to Taxes.

5.4 Property Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for property Taxes levied
with respect to the Assets attributable to the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period
and the Company shall be responsible for property Taxes levied with respect to
the Assets attributable to the Post-Effective Time Tax Period. Property Taxes
levied with respect to the Assets for the Tax period (for purposes of property
Taxes, the term "Tax period" means the period beginning on the assessment date
for property Taxes through the day before the next assessment date for such
property Taxes) that contains the Effective Time shall be prorated between the
Pre-Effective Time Tax Period and the Post-Effective Time Tax Period based on
the relative number of days prior to the Effective Time and on and after the
Effective Time during the Tax period. Except to the extent actually taken into
account in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital with respect to
property Taxes, upon receipt of any bill for such property Taxes, (a) the
Company or Seller shall present, whether before or after the payment of such
bill, a statement to Seller or the Company, as applicable, setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Person is entitled under this
_Section 5.4_ together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the proration amount and (b) the proration amount shall
be paid promptly but in no event later than 10 days after receipt of such
statement.

5.5 Tax Sharing Agreements. The Companys participation in any Tax sharing
agreement with Seller or any other Person shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and shall have no further effect with respect to any Pre-
Effective Time Tax Period or Post-Effective Time Tax Period.

 

5.6 Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes paid with
respect to a Pre-Effective Time Tax Period. The Company shall be entitled to
any refund of Taxes paid with respect to a Post-Effective Time Tax Period.
Refunds for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned based on the Taxes that
were paid by or on behalf of Buyer and Seller. If a Party receives a refund
to which the other Party is entitled, the Party receiving the refund shall
pay it to the Party entitled to the refund within 2 Business Days after
receipt.

5.7 Liability for Transfer Taxes. In the event any sales (including bulk
sales), use, documentary, stamp, registration, transfer, conveyance, excise,
recording, license, stock transfer stamps, or other similar taxes ("Transfer
Taxes") are incurred as a direct result of Buyers purchase of the Purchased
Units pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the payment
of such Transfer Taxes. The party required by law to file all necessary Tax
Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such Tax
Returns and Buyer and Seller shall each, and shall each cause their Affiliates
to, cooperate in the timely preparation and filing of, and join in the
execution of, any such Tax Returns. Buyer, Seller, and their respective
Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate,
reduce, or eliminate any Transfer Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



-26-  5.8 Tax Treatment of Transaction. Buyer and Seller agree that for federal
income Tax purposes, since the Company is a disregarded entity, the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Units hereunder will be treated as a sale of the
assets of the Company. The Parties agree that the transfer of ownership of the
Purchased Units will occur at the Effective Time and that all of the benefits
and burdens of ownership related to the Purchased Units will remain with the
Seller until the Effective Time.

Proceedings, demands, or assessments arising out of):

 

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Seller

Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses based upon,
attributable to, or resulting from (including any and all Proceedings,

-30-  8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

 

(a) The Seller Parties shall not have any Liability under _Section
8.3(a)(i)_:

 

(i) with respect to any individual claim involving Losses to any Buyer
Indemnified Party of less than $100,000 (each a "De Minimus Claim"), unless
such individual claim is related to one or more other claims which, in the
aggregate together with such individual claim, involve Losses in excess of
$100,000, in which case Seller shall have Liability for the full amount of
such claims (subject to the other limitations contained in this _Section
8.4_) and such claims shall not be considered De Minimus Claims; and

 

(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties that are indemnifiable in accordance with _Section
8.3(a)(i)_ exceeds $8,650,000 (the "Deductible") and, in such event, Seller
Parties shall be required to pay only the amount of Losses exceeding such
Deductible.

 

(b) Buyer shall not have any Liability under _Section 8.3(b)(i) _

 

(i) with respect to any De Minimus Claim; and

 

(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties that are indemnifiable in accordance with _Section
8.3(b)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible and, in such event, Buyer shall be required
to pay only the amount of Losses exceeding such Deductible.

 

(c) No Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party under
_Section 8.3(a)(i)_,  _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, or _Section 8.3(b)_ as
applicable, for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding an amount equal to
$173,000,000 (the "Representations and Warranties Cap") in connection with
Losses related to the failure of such Partys representations or warranties
to be true and correct.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
limitations on indemnification set forth in _Sections 8.4(a)_ , _8.4(b)_ , and
_8.4(c)_ shall not apply to Losses related to the failure to be true and
correct of any of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 2.13_ (Taxes) or _Section 2.16_
(Environmental) and (ii) the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Sections 8.4(a)(ii)_ and  _8.4(c)_ shall not apply to Losses related to the
failure to be true and correct of any of the representations and warranties

(Rights-of-Way). 

(e) For purposes of (i) determining the failure of any representations or
warranties (other than in  _Section 2.10(a)_) to be true and correct, (ii)
the breach of any covenants or agreements, and (iii) calculating Losses
hereunder, any materiality qualifiers in the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements shall be disregarded.

 



-31-  (f) Following the Closing, the right to indemnification pursuant to this 
_Article 8_ based on representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any
time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with,
any such representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with, any such covenant or agreements, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements. 

(g) The amount of any Loss under _Section 8.3_ shall be reduced by (i) the
amount of any insurance proceeds (other than those from self insurance)
realized by and paid to the Indemnified Party (or the Company for the benefit
of the Indemnified Party) in respect of such Loss and (ii) any amounts
actually recovered from third parties (or which are recoverable over time)
with respect to such Loss, after giving effect to any expenditures to obtain
such payments and any applicable deductible or retention and resulting
retrospective premium adjustment. Each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make applicable insurance claims with respect to any
claim for which it is seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_.

 

(h) EACH OF BUYER AND THE SELLER PARTIES WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY
LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION ANY "SPECIAL DAMAGES," AS DEFINED BELOW AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, IN EACH CASE IT BEING THE EXPRESS INTENT,
UNDERSTANDING, AND AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES THAT SUCH WAIVERS ARE TO BE GIVEN
THE FULLEST EFFECT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY PARTY. AS USED IN
THIS SECTION, " _SPECIAL DAMAGES_ " MEANS ALL SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (REGARDLESS OF HOW NAMED), BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE
(i) ANY PAYMENTS OR FUNDS WHICH ANY PARTY HERETO HAS EXPRESSLY PROMISED TO
PAY OR DELIVER TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO (ii) ANY CLAIMS OF ANY PERSON FOR
WHICH ONE PARTY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
(iii) DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM OR (iv) DAMAGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN ANY ORDER FROM A GOVERNMENTAL BODY.

(i) The Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover from an
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement more than once in respect of the same
damage suffered.

 



-32-  8.5 Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by prompt notice (a "Claim Notice") by the Buyer
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party") to the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party"); _provided, however_ , that failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from any
indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this _Article 8_ except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual loss and
prejudice as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall, within 30
days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party in
writing whether the Indemnifying Party admits or disputes the claim described
in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party gives written notice that it
admits the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 8_ , and subject to the limitations hereof, with
respect to the estimated amount of Losses stated in the Claim Notice. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing that it disputes
the claim for indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article 8_ with respect
thereto but disputes the amount of the Losses in connection therewith, then in
either of such cases the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice
shall be a disputed indemnification claim that must be resolved by settlement
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or by Proceedings
commenced in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party or by any other mutually agreeable
method.

(b) In the event that any Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or
demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Section 8.3_ (a "Third Party Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of the assertion of such Third Party Claim. The failure of the Indemnified
Party to give timely notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release,
waive, or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations with respect
thereto, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate
actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to
the provisions of this _Section 8.5_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which
must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to defend
against, negotiate, settle, or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder; _provided, however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the
Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party as provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle, or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within 10 days
prior to the time any response to a Third Party Claim is required, and in any
event within 30 days of the Indemnified Partys receipt of written notice of
the assertion 

 



-33-   of such Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do
so; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party must conduct its defense
of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard. If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle, or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, (ii) fails to
notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided, or (iii)
contests its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such Losses
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall defend against, negotiate,
settle, or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim in good faith and, upon
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, shall inform such Indemnifying
Party of material developments with respect to such Third Party Claim and
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to consult with the counsel for the
Indemnified Party (but only to the extent such communications do not result in
the loss of any privilege) regarding such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the expenses of defending such Third
Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party shall
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if (x) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to
participate or (y) in the reasonable opinion of either partys counsel, a
material conflict exists, or a or potential material conflict may be
reasonably expected to exist, between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party such that one counsel could not effectively represent both
parties interest; _provided further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim.
The Parties agree to provide reasonable access to each other Party to such
documents and information as may reasonably be requested in connection with
the defense, negotiation, or settlement of any such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.5_ to the contrary, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim (including
any settlement that includes equitable remedies) or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant (or claimants) and such
party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all Losses in
respect of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment
on any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party
to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim.

(c) After (i) any final decision, judgment, or award shall have been rendered
by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, (ii) a settlement shall have been
consummated, or (iii) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.

 



-34-  8.6 Acknowledgements; Exclusive Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, from and after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, including statutory or other claims arising under Environmental
Laws (other than any claim of fraud or intentional misrepresentation), but
excluding claims to be resolved under _Section 1.6_, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 8_ ; _provided, however_
, that nothing herein shall limit the rights of a Party to seek and obtain
injunctive relief in accordance with _Section 9.4_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Parties hereby waive and release from and after the Closing,
for themselves and for the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any and all rights, claims, and causes of action (other than any claim of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation), with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, they may have against the other Parties, their respective
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
members, agents, and representatives arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
8_. 

ARTICLE 9  MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Binding Provisions; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and, except as provided herein, their
respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned (a) by
any Seller Party without the prior written consent of Buyer or (b) by Buyer
without the prior written consent of the Seller Parties, except that Buyer
may assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder to any of
its Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that the Party making any such
assignment shall remain primarily liable with respect to any of
its obligations so assigned. Any attempt to assign this Agreement in a manner
prohibited by this _Section 9.1_ shall be void.

9.2 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement and all questions
relating to the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to the Laws of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction that would call for the application of the substantive laws of
any jurisdiction other than Delaware. Each Party hereby agrees that service
of summons, complaint, or other process in connection with any Proceedings
contemplated hereby may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to
such Party at the address specified pursuant to _Section 9.5_. EACH PARTY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY
RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

9.3 Severability. Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered
severable, and if for any reason any provision of this Agreement is determined
to be invalid and contrary to any existing or future law, such invalidity
shall not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this Agreement
that are valid.

 

9.4 Specific Performance. The Seller Parties acknowledge and agree that the
breach of this Agreement prior to the Closing would cause irreparable damage
to Buyer and that Buyer would not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore,
subject to _Section 8.6_, the obligations of the Seller Parties under this
Agreement prior to the Closing shall be enforceable by a decree of

 



-35-   specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief shall be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. The Seller Parties agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations under this Agreement, and hereby waive any requirement to post any
bond whatsoever in connection with any application or proceeding relating to
any such remedies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Parties shall be
limited to remedies of monetary damages for any breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement and in no event shall the Seller Parties be entitled to obtain
any relief other than monetary damages, including any form of specific
performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent
injunction, or any other equitable remedy that may then be available, and the
Seller Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree that they will
not seek any such relief or remedy hereunder.

9.5 Notices. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices,
consents, waivers and other communications required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient and deemed delivered if in writing,
as follows: (a) by personal delivery to the Party entitled to receive it; (b)

prepaid, in which case such notice, consent, waiver, or other communication

9.10 Waiver. The terms and provisions of this Agreement may be waived, or
consent for the departure therefrom may be granted, only by a written
document executed by the Party or Parties granting such waiver or giving such

-37-   to be or shall constitute a waiver or consent with respect to any other
terms or provisions of this Agreement, whether or not similar. Each such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which it was given or granted, and shall not constitute a
continuing waiver or consent. No failure or delay by a Party to exercise any
right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, and no course of dealing among
the Parties, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy of
the Party. No single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy under
this Agreement by a Party, nor any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
