disputed matters. The Settlement Accountant shall act as an expert and shall
only consider those

 



      
 

 



 

items that are identified on the Statement of Objections as in dispute unless
agreed during the Consultation Period. Within five (5) days of the appointment
of the Settlement Accountant, the Settlement Accountant shall set a schedule
for written submissions, which submissions shall be transmitted simultaneously
to the Settlement Accountant and Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise directed by the Settlement Accountant, the Purchaser shall
first make a written submission addressing the challenged items on the
Statement of Objections, the Seller shall be given an opportunity to respond
to the PurchaserÂ’s submission and, if the Seller does so, the Purchaser shall
be given an opportunity to respond to the SellerÂ’s response and to the extent
such response by the Purchaser contains new information, material or
arguments, the Seller shall be given an opportunity to respond solely to such
new information, material and/or arguments. The Settlement Accountant will
have the right to request information or ask questions. The Settlement
AccountantÂ’s determination shall take into account the definitions of Net
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Cash contained herein.

reasonable efforts to cause the Settlement Accountant to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days

the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement including the Accounting
Principles and based solely on the submissions and supporting materials
provided by the Purchaser and the Seller in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The Settlement Accountant may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
resolution of the dispute by the Settlement Accountant shall be final, binding
and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the
Settlement Accountant shall be borne by the Purchaser in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of the items that are successfully disputed by the
Seller (as finally determined by the Settlement Accountant) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of the items submitted to the Settlement Accountant
and by the Seller in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller (as finally
determined by the Settlement Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of the items submitted to the Settlement Accountant.

of the Disclosure Letter:

 



 

(a) the Target Company owning such Parcel has good and valid title to such
Parcel, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances,

Effect;

Section 5.14 _Leased Property_. _Schedule 5.14_ of the Disclosure Letter sets
forth all real property used by the Target Companies pursuant to leases,
subleases, licenses and any other types of occupancy agreements, that are

occupancy agreement, individually, a " ** _Real Property Lease_** "). A Target
Company has a valid and enforceable leasehold interest under each of the Real
Property Leases free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted

lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by a Target Company under
any of the Real Property Leases, except such defaults that do not have and are

compliance with all material covenants of the "Lessee" under the

 



      
 

 



 

Ireland Land Lease which if not complied with would have, or would reasonably
be likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has provided

(a) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable antitrust Laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the Proposed Transaction, including to cooperate in determining
which filings are required or advisable to obtain the consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust Laws ("
** _Governmental Antitrust Authority_** "), which actions include (i)
furnishing all information and documents required by applicable Law in
connection with approvals of, or filings with, any Governmental Antitrust
Authority, (ii) filing, or causing to be filed, as promptly as practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (iii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the termination of any
waiting period under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust Laws (as
listed on _Schedule 8.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter) and (iv) defending any
Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Proposed Transaction, including seeking to have any stay
or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the Seller and the Purchaser agree (x)
that no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of this
Agreement any required notification and report forms under the HSR Act will be
filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " ** _FTC_** ") and
the United States Department of Justice (the " ** _DOJ_** ") and (y) to use
reasonable best efforts to file any notification form with any other competent
Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Antitrust Authorities set forth on _Schedule 8.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter
no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the date of this
Agreement or any earlier time period mandated by statute in applicable
jurisdictions (and in any event as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof).

 



 

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in
_Section 7.4(a)_ , each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish to the
other, and the Seller shall cause the Target Companies to, (i) furnish to the
Purchaser such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
that is necessary under the HSR Act or any other antitrust merger control Laws
and (ii) permit the other party to review any filing or submission prior to
forwarding to the FTC, the DOJ and other Governmental Antitrust Authorities
and accept any reasonable comments made by that other party. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Antitrust Authorities and shall comply as promptly as
practicable with any such inquiry or request. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser agree not to, and the Seller shall cause the Target Companies not
to, participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or
by telephone, with any Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection with the
Proposed Transaction, unless it consults with the respective other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust
Authority, gives the respective other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. The Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing
fees or other disbursements to the applicable Governmental Authorities in
connection with obtaining any approvals or making the notifications or filings
required for the purposes of satisfying the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (including, without limitation, document translation fees or third party
expert fees but not including the costs of each partyÂ’s own legal advisors).

 



 

(c) The Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to comply with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Authority. The Purchaser agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or
any other Person so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the
Proposed Transaction, including consenting to any divestiture or other
structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any
Governmental Authority; provided that any such action shall be conditioned on
the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, and the Purchaser shall not be
required to take, or agree to commit to take, any such action that would have,
individually or in the aggregate a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, the Purchaser will not
take any action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would
be to delay or impede the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Proposed Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire by
merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of any Person or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of, such acquisition,

 



      
 

 



 

merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay
in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Antitrust
Authority necessary to consummate the Proposed Transaction or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the Proposed Transaction,
(iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal
or otherwise, or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the Proposed
Transaction.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4_ to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 7.4_ shall require, or be deemed to require, the Seller or any
of its Affiliates to propose, negotiate, offer to commit, effect or agree to
(x) any sale, divestiture, license or disposition of assets or businesses of
any Target Company or (y) any behavioral remedy of any Target Company.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Solicitation_. The Seller agrees that following the date of this
Agreement, neither the Seller, nor any of the Target Companies controlled by
the Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives will,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, consider, facilitate, encourage or
accept or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, any
other proposals from any Person relating to any acquisition or purchase of all
or any of the issued share capital of any of the Target Companies or all or
substantially all of the assets of any Target Company (other than the sale of
inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).
The Seller shall, and shall cause the Target Companies controlled by the
Seller to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that following the date
of this Agreement, regardless of whether this Agreement is terminated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
at the Closing. The parties hereto agree to keep the details of the
negotiation of this Agreement and the terms of this Agreement confidential,
and the Seller agrees to keep any confidential information of the Purchaser
and any Target Company confidential, except, in each case, (i) to the extent
required by Law, (ii) if required to enforce the terms of this Agreement or
(iii) for financial reporting purposes and except that the parties may
disclose such information to their respective Representatives as necessary in
connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long
as such Representatives agree to maintain the confidentiality of such
information).

 



 

Section 7.7 _Notice of Developments_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating
upon the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
the Seller will give the Purchaser prompt written notice of any material
development that would make the satisfaction of any of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 8.1_ or _8.2_ on the Closing Date reasonably unlikely or
impossible. No such notification (or failure to provide such notification)
shall be given any effect for purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and

 



      
 

 



 

warranties made by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, or determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ or _8.2_ have been
satisfied.

 



 

(b) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating
upon the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to the Seller of any material
development that would make the satisfaction of any of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 8.1_ or _8.3_ on the Closing Date reasonably unlikely or
impossible. No such notification (or failure to provide such notification)
shall be given any effect for purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and warranties made by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, or determining whether the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_
or _8.3_ have been satisfied.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Access to Properties, Books and Records_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Closing,
the Seller shall give the Purchaser reasonable access, upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours to all properties, books, records and key
management personnel of or pertaining to the Target Companies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing will not: (i) unduly interfere with the day-to-
day operations of the Target Companies; (ii) require the Seller or the Target
Companies to provide access or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any Law, or would relate to commercially sensitive
information, or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-
product protection; or (iii) include any sampling or intrusive testing for or
regarding any environmental matters without the SellerÂ’s prior written
consent. Any information disclosed will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement will govern. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company
may designate any competitively sensitive information made available to the
Purchaser under this Agreement as "outside counsel only" and such information
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the Purchaser and may not be
shared with the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives (other than such outside counsel).

 



 

Section 7.9 _Consents_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall use (and the Seller
shall cause the Company to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at the earliest practicable date the consents and approvals referred to
in _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section 6.2(a)(ii)_ hereof (or the schedules
thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no party shall be obligated to pay
any consideration to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested under any contract and (b) the consent of the Purchaser shall be
required with respect to any amendment or modification to any contract in
connection with obtaining any such consent or approval that is adverse in any
material respect to the Purchaser or any of the Target Companies.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing,
the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to those Company Personnel as of
immediately prior to the Closing who continue as employees of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date other than those represented by a
union (the " ** _Continuing Employees_** ") with base cash compensation,
target cash bonus opportunities and cash incentive compensation opportunities
that are at least the same as the base cash compensation, target cash bonus

 



      
 

 



 

opportunities and cash incentive compensation opportunities that were provided
to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. In
addition, from the Closing until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide the Continuing Employees
with employee benefits (excluding severance benefits, which are addressed in
_Section 7.10(b)_ ) having a comparable value, in the aggregate, to such
employee benefits that were provided to the Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this covenant, equity
awards, defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical or welfare benefits
shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) From the Closing until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing,
the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide severance benefits to any
Continuing Employee who is laid off or terminated without cause during such
twelve (12) month period, in an amount that is not less than the severance
benefits (including severance payments and continued health coverage but
excluding any benefits related to retiree medical or defined benefit pension
plan supplements or accruals) to which Company Personnel would have been
entitled pursuant to and under circumstances consistent with the terms of the
applicable Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Continuing
Employees first become eligible to participate at or after the Closing (the "
** _New Company Plans_** "), the Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Personnel or under any health and welfare
New Company Plans in which such Company Personnel may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods were waived or otherwise satisfied under a
corresponding Benefit Plan of the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date or would have been so waived or satisfied but for such Benefit PlanÂ’s
termination pursuant to _Section 7.10(c)_ , (ii) cause deductibles,
coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by such Company Personnel
during the applicable plan year in which such Company Personnel first
participate in the applicable New Company Plan to reduce the amount of
deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket payments under the New
Company Plans to the extent taken account under the corresponding Benefit Plan
of the Company in respect of the same plan year or would have been so taken
into account but for such Benefit PlanÂ’s termination pursuant to _Section
7.10(c)_ ; and (iii) recognize service credited by the Company prior to the
Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (and,
for purposes of severance and paid time off only, for purposes of determining
the amount or level of benefit) in any New Company Plan in which such Company
Personnel may be eligible to participate after the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Benefit Plan, (ii) limit the right of the Purchaser to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan following the Closing or
(iii) confer upon any Person whether or not a party to this Agreement any
right to employment, any right to compensation or benefits, or any other right
of any kind or nature whatsoever. Moreover, other than as provided in any
applicable employment agreement or other contract, nothing herein shall be
deemed to restrict the right of the Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

to terminate the employment of any Company Personnel. The terms and conditions
of employment for Company Personnel as of the Closing who are represented by a
union and who continue with the Company shall be governed by the applicable
collective bargaining agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company,
in its sole discretion, shall be permitted to (i) prior to the Closing, pay
out bonuses for any completed fiscal year to Company Personnel in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) on the Closing, pay
to any eligible Company Personnel a pro rata bonus in respect of the CompanyÂ’s
then current fiscal year through the Closing based on the CompanyÂ’
determination, in good faith (and in consultation with the Purchaser), of the
amounts earned, based on actual performance through the Closing (it being
understood that such pro rata bonuses shall be treated as Transaction
Expenses).

 



 

(f) To the extent that (x) any current or former Service Provider would be
entitled to any payment or benefit in connection with the Proposed Transaction
and (y) such payment or benefit would potentially constitute a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the US Tax Code, the Seller shall, prior to the
Closing:

 



 

(i) use its reasonable efforts to obtain a binding written waiver by such
Service Provider of any such portion of such parachute payment as exceeds 2.99
times such Service ProviderÂ’s "base amount" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(3) of the US Tax Code (the " ** _Waived Payments_** ") to the extent
such excess is not subsequently approved pursuant to a vote of the
stockholders of the Seller in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the US Tax Code;

 



 

(ii) provide to such stockholders all such disclosure as is required under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the US Tax Code and provide the Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure before it is
distributed to such stockholders and all other documents prepared by the
Seller in connection with this Section _7.10(e)_ ; and

 



 

(iii) hold a vote of such stockholders in a manner that is intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the US Tax Code.

 



 

Section 7.11 _No Control of the Target Companies Â’ Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct any of the Target CompaniesÂ’
operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the Target CompaniesÂ’ operations.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Resigned Directors_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Purchaser agrees to adopt a resolution to exempt any director or officer
who resigns effective upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction pursuant
to this Agreement (the " ** _Resigned Directors_** " _)_ from any liability
toward the Target Companies, except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct
or gross negligence. The Purchaser and its Affiliates will not, in the absence
of fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, raise any claim against any
directors of any Target Company or any Resigned Directors in connection with
this Agreement or their actions or

 



      
 

 



 

omissions undertaken until the Closing as directors, regardless of whether or
not such potential claims are known to the Purchaser or its Affiliates at the
time of the signing or completion of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Repayment of Specified Indebtedness_. Purchaser shall, at the
SellerÂ’s request, use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Seller
in seeking the delivery, or causing to be delivered, prior to the Closing,
payoff letters (and related documentation) in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser from each lender, creditor, noteholder or other
counterparty to which the Specified Indebtedness is owing, in each case, (i)
that sets forth the amount to be paid on or prior to the Closing Date,
together with wire transfer instructions and (ii) evidencing that the payment
of such amount would result in the full repayment, satisfaction, release, and
discharge of all current and future obligations of the Target Companies (and,
in the case of hedging, swap or similar agreements, the complete unwind and
settlement of such arrangements) in respect of such item and of all current
and future Encumbrances relating to such item.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Loan Notes_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall effectuate
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Note Agreement, such that, at the
time the Closing is completed, the Seller will own the Loan Notes.

from consummating the Proposed Transaction or performing its obligations under
this Agreement (unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of
a specific date, in which event such representation or warranty shall be true
and correct only as of such specific date, except as contemplated by this

obligations, and complied in all material respects with the agreements and

_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partyÂ’s breach of any provision of this Agreement
or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Proposed
Transaction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

(a) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred by

an injunction or other order that had the effect of restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Proposed Transaction;

 



 

(c) by the Purchaser if the Seller shall have breached in any material respect
any of its representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained

Section 11.1 _Announcements_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto will consult with each other before issuing press
releases or otherwise making any public statements or communicating with

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement set forth the entire agreement among the parties in respect of the
sale and purchase of the Shares and the Loan Notes and supersedes any prior
agreement (whether oral or written) relating to the Proposed Transaction. No
party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of any statement,
representation, warranty or undertaking, made by or on behalf of the other
party in relation to the Proposed Transaction which is not expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Waivers_. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right
or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall impair such right or
remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude
its exercise at any subsequent time and no single or partial exercise of any
such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise
of any other remedy.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts (including by portable document format (.pdf) or other
electronic means), each of which is an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Amendments_. No amendment to this Agreement shall be valid
unless it is in writing and duly executed by the Purchaser and the Seller.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. Each of the provisions of this Agreement is
severable, if any such provision is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction, it shall have
no effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable substitute provision
the effect of which is as close to its intended effect as possible.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in or _Section
7.12_ or _Section 11.14_ , a Person who is not a party to this Agreement shall
have no right to enforce any of its terms and this Agreement is not intended
to give any Person other than the parties hereto and their permitted assigns
any rights hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR
DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES, THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND THE INTERPRETATION
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER OR RELATED
IN ANY WAY TO THE FOREGOING, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE DOMESTIC LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY
CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE

 



      
 

 



 

STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION
OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT (A) THE REQUIREMENTS OF 6. DEL. C. Â§ 2708 ARE SATISFIED AND THAT
THE STATUTE MANDATES THE APPLICATION OF DELAWARE LAW TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES, THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND THE INTERPRETATION
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES, (B) NO OTHER
JURISDICTION HAS A MATERIALLY GREATER INTEREST IN THE FOREGOING, AND THAT (C)
THE APPLICATION OF DELAWARE LAW WOULD NOT BE CONTRARY TO THE FUNDAMENTAL
POLICY OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT, ABSENT THE PARTIESÂ’ CHOICE OF DELAWARE
LAW, WOULD HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE FOREGOING.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Dispute Resolution_. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW CASTLE
COUNTY, DELAWARE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY AND AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS
IN RESPECT OF THE SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT. EACH PARTY AGREES TO COMMENCE ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY,
DELAWARE. EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF IMPROPER VENUE OR INCONVENIENT
FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT AND WAIVES ANY
BOND, SURETY, OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ANY OTHER PARTY WITH
RESPECT THERETO. ANY PARTY MAY MAKE SERVICE ON ANY OTHER PARTY BY SENDING OR
DELIVERING A COPY OF THE PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED AT THE ADDRESS AND
IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF NOTICES IN _SECTION 11.5_. NOTHING IN
THIS _SECTION 11.13_ , HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE
LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR AT EQUITY. EACH PARTY
AGREES THAT A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO
BROUGHT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN
ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW OR AT EQUITY.

 



 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO
ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED HEREIN.

 



      
 

 



 

This _Section 11.13_ shall not apply to any dispute under _Article III_ that
is required to be decided by the Settlement Accountant.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Privilege; Counsel_. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
(" ** _Skadden_** ") and AandL Goodbody (" ** _A andL Goodbody_**") have been
engaged by the Seller to represent it in connection with the Proposed
Transaction. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, any of Skadden or AandL Goodbody may represent the
Seller in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller may be directly
adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
and even though any of Skadden or AandL Goodbody may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling
ongoing matters for the Purchaser or the Company and (b) waives any conflict
in connection therewith. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, as to all communications among any of Skadden or AandL Goodbody
and the Target Companies or the Seller (including any of their respective
directors, officers or employees) that relate in any way to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proposed Transaction, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Seller and shall be controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.
The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further
understands and agrees that the parties have each undertaken commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-
client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Purchaser
(on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees
that the consummation of the Proposed Transaction may result in the
inadvertent disclosure of information that may be confidential or subject to a
claim of privilege. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) further understands and agrees that any disclosure of information
that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice
or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The Purchaser (on
its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed information
to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and a third party
other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by any of Skadden or AandL Goodbody to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Seller. Each of Skadden and AandL Goodbody
shall be a third party beneficiary for purposes of this _Section 11.14_.
