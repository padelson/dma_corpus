 INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, and in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, Buyer, Sub, the Company and the Shareholders hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

  

 1.1 The Merger. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sub is being merged with and into the Company. Articles of Merger, the related Plan of Merger, and any other required documents (collectively, the "Merger Documents"), substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_, have been duly prepared, executed, and acknowledged by the Company and Sub, and delivered to the Secretary of State of Washington and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as applicable, for filing, as provided in the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law. The merger effected by the Merger Documents ("the "Merger") shall become effective at such time as the Merger Documents have been filed with the Secretary of State of Washington and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Merger Documents (the "Effective Time"). 

   

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time: (i) Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company as survivor after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, with such changes as provided for in the Merger Documents, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended, (iii) the Bylaws of Sub shall be the Bylaws of the Company until duly amended, (iv) the directors of Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, (v) the officers of Sub shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, (vi) each issued Company Share (as defined at _Section 2.1.2_) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration provided for at _Section 1.3_, shall cease to represent capital stock of the Company, and shall be cancelled, extinguished and retired, (vii) each issued share of common stock of Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a share of Common Stock (as defined at _Section 2.1.2_) of the Company and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sub shall become all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, and (viii) the Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time, have all the effects provided by applicable law. 

        
  

 1.3 Merger Consideration and Purchase Price. 

  

  

 (a) In accordance with _Section 1.2_, each issued and outstanding Company Share shall, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, be converted, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, into the right to receive that portion of the Purchase Price, when and as payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, determined by dividing the Purchase Price (as defined at _Section 1.3(b)_) by the aggregate number of Company Shares issued and outstanding at the Closing (as defined at _Section 1.4(a)_) (the "Per Share Conversion Payment"). For avoidance of doubt, the same Per Share Conversion Payment shall be due in respect of both Company Shares that are Series A Common Stock and Company Shares that are Series B Common Stock (as defined at _Section 2.1.2_). 

   

 (b) Buyer and Sub are, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, paying as consideration by virtue of the Merger an amount (such amount, as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, "Purchase Price") determined as follows: 

    

 (i) Two Hundred Four Million Five Hundred Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($204,525,000) (the foregoing amount, the "Enterprise Value") _minus_ (v) the estimated amount of Debt (as defined at _Section 1.4_) of the Company outstanding as of 11:59 P.M. Pacific Standard Time on the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 1.4(a)_) (the "Close of Business"), and  _minus_ (w) the estimated amount of Transactional Expenses (as defined at _Section 1.4_) outstanding or accrued but not paid as of the Close of Business, and _minus_ (x) those payments required to be made to any employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions described in this Agreement, as further identified at _Schedule 1.3(b)_ ("Employee Payments") and _plus_ (y) the amount of cash and cash equivalents ("Cash") reflected on the books of the Company as of the Close of Business (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, the amount described in the following clause (z)), and _plus_ (z) the amount of outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Shareholder Notes (as defined in _Section 1.4(b)_) as of the Close of Business (as defined at _Section 1.4(a)_) and prior to payment of such notes pursuant to _Section 1.4(d)_; 

  

 (ii) The amount determined pursuant to item (i) above is being decreased in the event that Working Capital (as defined at _Section 1.6_) of the Company as of the Close of Business is less than negative Two Million Five Hundred Seventy Four Two Hundred Seventy and No/100 Dollars (-$2,574,270.00) (such amount "Target Working Capital") and is being increased in the event that Working Capital of the Company as of the Close of Business is more than the Target Working Capital; and 

  

 (iii) A portion of the Purchase Price is being held back from payment to the Shareholders and deposited in escrow in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.4_ for purposes of providing a source of funding for (x) any adjustments in respect of final determinations of the Debt, Transactional Expenses, Cash, and Working Capital of the Company as of Closing and (y) for indemnification of Buyer and Sub pursuant to _Article IV_. Any release from escrow to satisfy obligations to indemnify Buyer and Sub pursuant to _Article IV_, including any release from the General Claim Fund (as that term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) in respect of the Special Indemnity Claim, shall be deemed a further adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

  

 1.4 Closing; Payment of Shareholder Notes; Distribution of Cash; Escrow Amount; Payment of Purchase Price Amount. 

  

  

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") is taking place at the offices of Preston Gates and Ellis LLP, Seattle, Washington at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the Date of Agreement (the "Closing Date"). 

  

      

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Debt" means all funded indebtedness, determined without duplication, and includes, without limitation, notes; capitalized leases; bank term and revolving credit loans; obligations related to drawn letters of credit; bonds evidencing funded indebtedness; debentures; borrowings from lending institutions other than banks; subordinated loans and subordinated debt securities with or without stated maturity; bank bills; bank overdrafts; obligations with respect to the factoring or discounting of accounts receivable and other instruments; any dividends payable to the Shareholders; and accrued interest and expense and penalties on any of the foregoing (including prepayment penalties _except_ in the case of the Debt outstanding to the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Pruco Life Insurance Company of America, which Prudential and Pruco prepayment penalties shall be excluded from the definition of Debt; the Debt in respect of the foregoing referenced Prudential and Pruco entities, the "Prudential Debt"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, "Debt", including Debt calculated as of the Close of Business, shall include any such amounts that were paid by Buyer on behalf of the Company prior to the Effective Time on the Closing Date. "Debt" shall however _not_ include (w) the amount of the stand-by letter of credit issued by Bank of America with respect to the Company\'s worker\'s compensation insurance, (x) accounts payable or other operating liabilities of the Company to the extent taken into account in determining Working Capital (as such term is defined in _Section 1.6(a)_), (y) the $5,386,919 in principal, and related interest, penalty and expenses, in respect of the note identified on _Schedule 1.4(b)_ (the note identified in _Schedule 1.4(b)_, the "Designated Note"), and (z) amounts due to MikronWood, LLC ("MikronWood") which, as of Closing, will be wholly owned by the Company. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Transactional Expenses" means investment banking, consulting, advisory, legal and accounting fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt and duplication, as applicable, Transactional Expenses do _not_ include any prepayment penalties in respect of the Prudential Debt and do _not_ include any Employee Payments. 

  

 (d) Those Shareholders that are obligated to Company in respect of those promissory notes to the Company described on _Schedule 1.4(d)_ (the "Shareholder Notes") hereby agree to pay to the Company, as of the business day after the Effective Time, all principal and accrued interest on the Shareholder Notes. 

  

 (e) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sub is holding back from the Purchase Price and depositing by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of Twenty-six Million Six Hundred Three Thousand Two Hundred Twenty Three and 53/100 Dollars ($26,603,223.53) (such amount, together with income thereon, additions thereto, and releases therefrom, being referred to herein as the "Escrow Amount") with Bank of America, N.A., Houston, Texas office (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Amount shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Escrow Agreement"), which is being entered into by the Escrow Agent named therein, Purchaser and Shareholders concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement on the Closing Date. 

  

 (f) The balance of the Purchase Price (the Purchase Price less the Escrow Amount) is concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement being paid by the Buyer and Sub to the Shareholders by delivery by Buyer and Sub of notes in substantially the form of _Exhibit C_, which notes (the "One-Day Notes") shall, effective as of the Merger, be deemed the joint and several obligation of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. Buyer and Sub shall issue One-Day Notes to each Shareholder. Pursuant to the terms of the One-Day Notes, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each Shareholder on the first business day immediately after Closing, in payment of such One-Day Note, an amount equal to the principal amount of the One-Day Note held by such Shareholder by delivery by wire transfer of immediately available funds according to wire instructions supplied by the Shareholders prior to Closing. The principal 

  

      

  
  

amount of the One-Day Notes to be delivered by Buyer and Sub to each
Shareholder pursuant to this _Section 1.4(f)_ shall equal the product of the
number of Company Shares held by each such Shareholder as of the Closing Date
multiplied by the remainder of the total amount to be paid by Buyer and Sub
pursuant to this _Section 1.4(f)_ divided by the aggregate number of Company
Shares issued and outstanding as of Closing (the number of Company Shares held
by a Shareholder as compared to the aggregate number of Company Shares issued
and outstanding as of Closing, such Shareholder\'s "Pro Rata Share"). As
a condition to receipt of the One-Day Notes contemplated by this _Section
1.4(f)_, each Shareholder has delivered to the Company\'s transfer agent,
Preston Gates and Ellis LLP, certificates representing all of the Company Shares
held by such Shareholder. The One-Day Notes shall be secured through a pledge
by the Buyer of the stock certificate representing its ownership interest in
the Company following the Closing, and as provided in the Pledge Agreement
between Buyer and the Shareholders in substantially the form of _Exhibit D_.

  

  

 1.5 Execution and Filing of Merger Documents. The Company and Sub have executed and delivered original signatures to the Merger Documents for filing with the Washington Secretary of State and the Delaware Secretary of State, as applicable. The Buyer, Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Merger Documents, that: (i) the Merger Documents are ancillary documents filed solely to effect this merger transaction pursuant to the requirements of the Washington Business Corporation Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law; (ii) as to any inconsistency or disagreement between the Merger Documents, on the one hand, and this Agreement, on the other hand, this Agreement shall govern; and (iii) the representations, covenants, obligations, indemnities and other agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement, including the agreements contained herein relating to adjustments to the Purchase Price and the payments and obligations undertaken by the Buyer pursuant to this _Article I_, are (subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, including without limitation _Sections 4.5_ and _4.6_ ) in addition to, cumulative with, and survive the execution, delivery and filing with the Washington Secretary of State and the Delaware Secretary of State, as applicable, of the Merger Documents. 

  

 1.6 Working Capital Adjustment and Final Determination of Purchase Price. 

  

  

 (a) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date (unless the Closing Date is the end of a calendar month, in which case such period shall be thirty (30) days), Shareholders Representative (as defined at _Section 4.8_), at the sole cost of the Shareholders, shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a copy of a balance sheet for the Company (the "Closing Balance Sheet") as of the Closing Date, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, calculating actual Working Capital, Cash, Debt and Transactional Expenses outstanding or accrued or on hand (as applicable) as of the Close of Business in the same manner (insofar as applicable) as the Target Working Capital has been calculated. In connection with the Closing Balance Sheet, the Shareholders Representative shall prepare and furnish to the Buyer a schedule (the "Closing Schedule") showing the difference, if any, between the Target Working Capital and the Working Capital as determined by the Shareholders Representative for the Closing Balance Sheet, the difference between (x) amounts of Debt, Cash and Transactional Expenses used to determine the Purchase Price as of the Closing Date, and (y) the actual amounts for each such item as of the Close of Business, as well as the Shareholders Representative\'s determination of the Purchase Price (the "Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation"). "Working Capital" shall equal the difference between (y) the "current assets" of the Company as of the Close of Business, less (z) the "current liabilities" of the Company as of the Close of Business. For purposes of determining Working Capital, except as provided otherwise in this _Section 1.6(a)_, "current assets" and "current liabilities" shall be determined in accordance with GAAP, shall be defined by and limited to those general ledger accounts of the Company for "current assets" and "current liabilities" as specified at _Schedule 1.6(a)_ (and other general ledger accounts shall be disregarded in determining Working Capital), and shall exclude (a) Cash, (b) the Shareholder Notes, amounts due from MikronWood, and equipment held for sale, (c) the current portion of Debt, including any portion that becomes current as a result of the Closing, (d) any amount in respect of the Designated Note, (e) any 

  

      

  

amounts that otherwise qualify as Transactional Expenses or Employee
Payments, and (f) any prepayment penalties in respect of the Prudential Debt,
and shall include (x) an appropriate receivable for expected year-end
supplier rebates for 2004, (y) an appropriate payable in the amount of the
expected employer match for 2004 for the Company\'s Salary Deferral
Plan, effective January 1, 1988, as amended June 21, 2002, June 23, 2003 and
December 23, 2003 (401(k) Plan) (to the extent not previously accrued), and
(z) an appropriate payable in the amount of the Company\'s obligations in
2004 for the Company\'s Quarterly Profit Sharing Plan 1997 (to the extent not
previously accrued or paid) (items included or excluded from
"current assets," "current liabilities" and Debt in determining Working
Capital and the Purchase Price are illustrated on _Schedule 1.6(a)_
attached hereto). For purposes of this Agreement, "GAAP" shall mean United
States generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied by
the Company; GAAP shall be deemed to include the same materiality standards
and other standards and accounting practices historically used by the Company,
including the Company\'s inventory valuation standards and procedures as set
forth at _Schedule 2.1.21_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, so long as not
clearly inconsistent with United States generally accepted accounting
principles; without limiting the foregoing, GAAP shall be deemed to include,
for inventory valuation purposes, the Company\'s valuation principles and
procedures stated on a FIFO basis. In addition, for purposes of determining
inventory as of the Close of Business, those further inventory, counting and
valuation procedures as set forth on _Exhibit E_ will be used.

  

 (b) The Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule and to agree or disagree as to the Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation. If the Buyer agrees with the Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation or does not object to such calculation in accordance with the following sentence, the amount of Working Capital, Debt, Cash, Transactional Expenses and Purchase Price shown thereon shall be final, conclusive and binding (in such case, the "Final Purchase Price Calculation"). If the Buyer does not agree with the Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation, the Buyer shall, within such thirty (30) day period, deliver a written objection to the Shareholders Representative which shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objection, and a computation of the Working Capital, Debt, Cash, Transactional Expenses and Purchase Price asserted by the Buyer (the "Buyer\'s Purchase Price Calculation" and collectively, the "Objection"). Upon the Shareholders Representative\'s receipt of the Objection, the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Objection. If the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative resolve the Objection, the amount they agree upon shall be final, conclusive and binding (in such case, the "Final Purchase Price Calculation"), but if the Objection cannot be resolved by such negotiation within thirty (30) days after the Shareholders Representative\'s receipt of the Objection (the "Reconciliation Deadline"), the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Schedule, the Objection, and all work papers related thereto (collectively, the "Determination Materials"), shall be submitted to the Seattle, Washington offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers (or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve, the Seattle, Washington offices of such other nationally recognized accounting firm as the Buyer and Shareholders Representative may mutually agree to (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however that under no circumstances shall an accounting firm be chosen that has performed material services for any of the Parties in the three (3) year period preceding the Closing Date (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), which shall review the Determination Materials and shall determine the amount of Working Capital, Debt, Cash and Transactional Expenses outstanding or accrued or on hand (as applicable) as of the Close of Business and the Purchase Price. If the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative cannot mutually agree upon an Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the Reconciliation Deadline, then each of the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer shall designate up to three (3) such firms of certified public accountants and a single firm shall be selected by lot after eliminating one (1) firm designated as objectionable by each of the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer. If either the Shareholders Representative or the Buyer 

  

      

  
  

elects not to participate in the selection process described above, a
certified public accounting firm shall be selected by lot from the selections
of the participating party. The Accounting Arbitrator shall not undertake any
review of any matters not specifically identified by Buyer as being in dispute
in the Objection and may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such items claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such items claimed by either party, and its determination
may not be outside the range comprised of Buyer\'s Purchase Price Calculation
and Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall make its determination in accordance with GAAP as herein
defined and in accordance with the provisions herein defining Working Capital
for purposes of this _Section 1.6_. The Accounting Arbitrator\'s decision as
to Working Capital, Debt, Cash, Transactional Expenses outstanding or accrued
or on hand (as applicable) as of the Close of Business and the Purchase Price
shall be final, conclusive, and binding (in such case, the "Final Purchase
Price Calculation"). The parties shall cause the Accounting Arbitrator to
notify the parties in writing of its determination within forty-five (45)
days following the receipt of the Determination Materials. As part of its
determination and decision, the Accounting Arbitrator shall recite the Final
Purchase Price Calculation, and the Purchase Price and shall set forth which
party is required to make a payment in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.6(b)_. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator, and
the reasonable fees and expenses of the prevailing party in connection with
proceedings before the Accounting Arbitrator, shall be paid by the party (the
non-prevailing party) whose estimated Final Purchase Price Calculation (the
Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation or Buyer\'s Purchase
Price Calculation, as applicable) is furthest away from the Accounting
Arbitrators\' determination of Final Purchase Price Calculation; if the
Shareholders are the parties responsible for the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator and the prevailing party, such amount shall be payable
solely by withdrawal from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall determine the reasonableness of the fees and
expenses of the prevailing party in connection with proceedings before the
Accounting Arbitrator. All determinations pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)_
shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties hereto. Once the
Working Capital, Debt, Transactional Expenses outstanding or accrued or on
hand (as applicable) as of the Close of Business, and the Purchase Price have
been determined in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.6(b)_,
such calculation shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes of
this Agreement.

  

 (c) If the Purchase Price as shown in the Final Purchase Price Calculation is less than the Purchase Price as determined at the Closing, an amount equal to such difference plus interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the prime rate as published in the Money Rates column of _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Closing Date (the "Agreed Rate") shall be paid to the Buyer out of the Escrow Amount, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Purchase Price as shown in the Final Purchase Price Calculation is greater than the Purchase Price as determined at the Closing, Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference to the Shareholders plus interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the Agreed Rate, which payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The amount to be paid to each Shareholder pursuant to the prior sentence shall equal its Pro Rata Share of the total amount to be paid. The Buyer and Shareholders Representative shall make any payments or issue any instructions to the Escrow Agreement contemplated by this _Section 1.6(c)_ within five (5) days after the earlier to occur of the date (i) the Final Purchase Price Calculation becomes final, conclusive and binding without a decision of the Accounting Arbitrator or (ii) the Accounting Arbitrator notifies the parties in writing of its determination of the Final Purchase Price Calculation according to the provisions of _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof. 

  

      

  
  

 (d) For purposes of preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Schedule, and Shareholders Representative\'s Purchase Price Calculation, and for purposes of addressing the Objections, if any, the Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to Shareholders Representative, on a prompt and timely basis, access to all relevant accounting and other records of the Company and shall allow the Shareholders Representative reasonable access to Company employees (including Gary Crane). 

  

 (e) Determinations of Working Capital, Cash, Debt and Transactional Expenses are to be made as of the Close of Business. After Closing, Buyer and the Company agree that no additional Debt will be added after Closing and through to the Close of Business and the Company will during such period otherwise be operated in the ordinary course of business. 

  

  

 1.7 Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

  

 (a) The parties intend that an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any comparable provision of applicable state or local law be made with respect to Buyer\'s acquisition of the Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The parties agree that the parties are not entitled to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to California. 

   

 (b) Before the Closing, Buyer prepared an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any corresponding forms under comparable provisions of applicable state or local law (the "Section 338(h)(10) Agreement"). Buyer and the Shareholders shall execute such Section 338(h)(10) Agreement, and Buyer and the Shareholders shall each promptly and timely file such executed Section 338(h)(10) Agreement. Buyer and the Shareholders shall report the purchase of the Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and no person shall take any position to the contrary thereto in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable law pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 1.7(f)_, determine, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in any event no later than seventy-five (75) days following Closing, the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis (as defined under applicable Treasury Regulations) and the allocation of such Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis among the assets of the Company. Such allocation of the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis shall be made in accordance with Section 338(b) of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations. The parties agree that there shall be no allocation of the Deemed Sales Price or Adjusted Grossed-up Basis to the Noncompetition Agreements. 

   

 (d) In the event that any allocation described in _Section 1.7(c)_ is disputed by any taxing authority, the person receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with Buyer or the Shareholders, as necessary, concerning resolution of such dispute. 

  

 (e) In the event that the Purchase Price is adjusted for any reason, including the determination of the Final Purchase Price Calculation under _Section 1.6_ of this Agreement, (i) the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis shall be adjusted to reflect such change, the provisions of this _Section 1.7_ shall be followed in redetermining the allocation of the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis; and (iii) Buyer and the Shareholders will, to the extent required by applicable law, file amended Tax Returns consistent with such revised allocation. 

  

      

  
  

 (f) Buyer shall promptly provide the Shareholders Representative with the allocations determined under _Section 1.7(c)_. If the Shareholders Representative shall disagree with any material aspect of Buyer\'s allocation under _Section 1.7(c)_, the matter shall be referred to the Accounting Arbitrator, which shall resolve any disputed item within thirty (30) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator, and the reasonable fees and expenses of the prevailing party, shall be borne by the non-prevailing party or shared in accordance with the determination of the Accounting Arbitrator. Any allocation determined under _Section 1.7(c)_, except in the event the Shareholders Representative disagrees with such allocation, in which case the allocation determined by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section 1.7(f)_, shall be referred to herein as the "Purchase Price Allocation" and shall be binding on the parties hereto. Subject to _Section 1.7(i)_, Buyer and the Shareholders (i) shall be bound by such allocation for purposes of determining any Tax; (ii) shall prepare and file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, the Section 338(h)(10) Agreement) to be filed with any taxing authority in a manner consistent with such allocation; and (iii) shall take no position inconsistent with such allocation in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable law pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

  

 (g) The Shareholders shall cause the Company to include in its Internal Revenue Service Form 1120S and in any corresponding state or local Tax Returns all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries through and including the Closing Date, including, without limitation, the consequences of the deemed sale pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 (h) Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements shall be terminated as of the date hereof, and after the date hereof, the Company shall not have any further rights or liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be the sole Tax Sharing Agreement relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. The Shareholders shall compensate Buyer for and hold Buyer harmless against any Tax imposed by a taxing authority as a result of such termination and, if any such termination is not binding on any taxing authority, any adverse effect which would have been avoided if such termination had been given effect by such taxing authority. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Tax Sharing Agreements" means all existing Tax sharing agreements or arrangements (whether or not written) binding the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any agreements or arrangements which afford any other person the benefit of any Tax asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, afford the Company or any Company Subsidiary the benefit of any Tax asset of any other person or require or permit the transfer or assignment of income, revenues, receipts, or gains. 

  

 (i) Buyer shall pay, be responsible for, and indemnify the Shareholders against any Incremental Tax Cost of the Section 338(h)(10) Election to the extent set forth in this _Section 1.7(i)_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Incremental Tax Cost" shall mean a portion of the additional Tax (as defined at _Section 2.1.7(e)_) paid or payable by the Shareholders as a result of the allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ to the assets of the Company in an amount, in the case of any asset, in excess of the financial book value of such asset, if any, as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, but only to the extent that such allocation results in the recognition of income other than long term capital gain by the Shareholders as a part of their gain resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the aggregate of such excesses, the "Aggregate Excess Allocation"). For avoidance of doubt, inventory shall be valued on the Closing Balance Sheet consistent with past practices and stated on a FIFO basis. To the extent that the Aggregate Excess Allocation is equal to or less than Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000), Buyer shall reimburse the Shareholders in an amount equal to seven percent (7%) of the Aggregate 

  

      

  
  

Excess Allocation. In addition, to the extent that the Aggregate Excess
Allocation exceeds Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000), Buyer shall reimburse
the Shareholders in an amount equal to the sum of (i) seven percent (7%) of
the Aggregate Excess Allocation that exceeds Eight Million Dollars
($8,000,000) plus (ii) an amount equal to twenty-eight percent (28%) of the
Aggregate Excess Allocation that exceeds Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000).
Amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid at the time of the
final determination of the Purchase Price Allocation pursuant to _Section
1.7(f) _. Each Shareholder shall be entitled to its Pro Rata Share of the
reimbursements to be made by Buyer under this  _Section 1.7(i)_. The
obligations of the Shareholders to report consistently with such allocation
are conditioned on the receipt of the payment described in this _Section
1.7(i)_.

  

 (j) For purposes of this _Section 1.7_, any notice provided to the Shareholders Representative will be deemed to have been provided to all of the Shareholders, and any action taken by the Shareholders Representative will be deemed to have authorized and approved by the Shareholders. Nothing in this _Section 1.7(j)_ is meant to limit the provisions of _Section 4.9_ in any way. 

  

  

 1.8 Termination of Shareholders Agreement. The Shareholders Agreement dated December 22, 1994, as amended, is terminated effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 1.9 Resignations. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each officer and director (or manager, in the case of limited liability companies) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is tendering her or his written resignation in such capacity, and the Company is delivering those resignations to the Buyer, which such resignations shall be effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 1.10 Employee Payments. All Employee Payments, other than those to be made more than three (3) months after Closing, shall be deemed to have been paid immediately prior to Closing for all relevant Tax purposes. The full aggregate amount of Employee Payments, including all amounts to be withheld for Taxes but excluding the employer\'s portion of the Medicare tax payment (1.45%), shall be deducted in determining the Purchase Price; provided, however, that if any Employee Payments are paid on or prior to the Closing Date, resulting in either the reduction of Cash or an increase of Debt as of the Close of Business, then such amounts of Employee Payments shall not be deducted in determining the Purchase Price. In the event any of the Employee Payments are ultimately not made or are returned to the Company (which, for these purposes, shall include payments returned by Paul Warner in respect of the buy-out of his post-termination medical benefits), then within thirty (30) days of a determination that such payment is not to be made or of the return of payment, the Buyer shall pay to each Shareholder, as an additional installment of the Purchase Price, such Shareholder\'s Pro Rata Share of the amount in question. If the Company is entitled to a return of such a payment, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a repayment of such amount.

The uses being made of the Owned Properties are in material conformity in all material respects with the certificates of occupancy issued for the Owned Properties. The Owned Properties are in compliance in all material respects with all building, fire, zoning and other ordinances and regulations applicable thereto. The Owned Properties and the present use and condition thereof do not materially violate any applicable deed restrictions or other covenants, restrictions or agreements, site plan approvals, zoning or subdivision regulations or urban redevelopment plans applicable thereto, as modified by any duly issued variances. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party to any reciprocal easement agreement affecting any of the Owned Properties is in default thereunder which default has had or will have a material impact on the Company, and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default thereunder. All maintenance payments with respect to such reciprocal easement agreements which were due and payable by the Company prior to the date hereof have been paid. No building or other improvement which is part of any of the Owned Properties encroaches, in any material respect, upon any property owned by any adjacent landowner or upon any real property interest held by any other Person with respect to any of the Owned Properties (including easements on the Owned Properties) or upon any setback lines or similar encumbrances and no asset of any other Person encroaches upon the Owned Properties, except such encroachments, if any, which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value, or impair in any significant way the current use of, the property subject thereto. Except for the water well located on the Owned Properties, all water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone and other utilities serving the Owned Properties are supplied 

   

      

   

directly to the Owned Properties by facilities of public utilities and are
adequate for the full operation of the businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Governmental Entity
nor any other Person plans to change any access from any highway or road to
any of the Owned Properties or plans any improvements which might result in a
special assessment against any of the Owned Properties. Each parcel of Owned
Properties abuts on and has direct vehicular access to a public road, or has
access to a public road via a permanent, irrevocable, appurtenant easement
benefiting such parcel, and access to such Owned Properties is provided by
paved public right-of-ways with adequate curb cuts available. There are
no outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase the Owned
Properties, or any portion thereof or interest therein.

  

 (b) _Schedule 2.1.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all parcels of real estate subject to leases to which the Company is a party as a lessee ("Leased Properties"), in each case, setting forth the lessor and lessee thereof and the date and term of each of the leases, and the street address (where appropriate) of each property covered thereby. Each such lease is in full force and effect, and the Company is not in default or breach under any such lease nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any third party. No event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would cause a material breach of or default under any of such leases. 

  

 (c) The buildings, fixtures, and other improvements located on the Owned Properties and Leased Properties (i) are in compliance with all material requirements of applicable zoning code and similar laws and regulations, (ii) benefit from all required material certificates of occupancy, building, safety, fire and health approvals, and (iii) are in material compliance with all applicable deed restrictions or other property covenants and restrictions. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, condemnation, or eminent domain proceedings with respect to either the Owned Properties or Leased Properties. 

  

 (d) The Company Subsidiaries do not presently own or lease, and have not at any time in the past owned or leased, real property or conducted business operations providing products or services to third parties.

Each Shareholder agrees that he, she or it will provide Buyer with copies of any such memoranda, letters, documents and other materials if Buyer reasonably requests any such materials to defend the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary in any Proceeding.

Returns to Buyer no later than five (5) days prior to the due date for such
Company Tax Return, shall permit Buyer to review and comment on each such
Company Tax Return prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such
Company Tax Return as are reasonably requested by Buyer to the extent
necessary to make such Company Tax Return consistent with the Company Tax
Returns filed in Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

provided, however, that any Losses incurred in connection with the matters
described in _Section 4.1(c), 4.1(e)_ and _4.1(f)_ shall include
consequential and punitive damages.

  

 4.2 Indemnification Obligations of the Buyer. Subject to the other provisions of this Article IV, from and after Closing, the Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the Shareholders and their trustees and agents harmless from and against, and to reimburse the Shareholders and their trustees and agents with respect to, any and all Losses incurred by any of them by reason of or arising out of or in connection with: 

  

  

 (a) any breach, or any claim (including claims by parties other than the Shareholders) that if true, would constitute a breach, by the Buyer or Sub of any representation or warranty of the Buyer or Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to the Shareholders or the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;

 4.3 Notice of Claims. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be the subject of the following claim and notice procedures: 

  

  

 (a) If an indemnified party reasonably believes that it may incur any Losses, it shall deliver a claim notice ("Claim Notice") to the indemnifying party. If an indemnified party receives notice of a third-party claim for which it intends to seek indemnification hereunder, it shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of such claim, so that the indemnifying party\'s defense of such claim under _Section 4.4_ hereunder may be timely instituted; provided, however, that the failure of an indemnified party to give prompt written notice of a claim shall not affect its rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that an indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

  

 (b) When Losses are actually incurred or paid by an indemnified party or on an indemnified party\'s behalf or otherwise fixed or determined, the indemnified party shall deliver a payment certificate (a "Payment Certificate") to the indemnifying party for such Losses.

 4.4 Defense of Third Party Claims. 

  

  

 (a) The indemnifying party under this _Article VI_ (in the case of the Shareholders, through the Shareholders Representative) shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party, the defense of any third-party claim, action, or suit or compromise or settlement or payment thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnified party may, at its election, participate in the defense of any such claim, action, or suit through counsel of its choosing, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall fail to defend diligently any such third-party action, claim, or suit, then the indemnified party may defend, through counsel of its own choosing, such action, claim, or suit and may settle such action, claim, or suit and recover from the indemnifying party all Losses associated therewith including the amount of such settlement or of any judgment and the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense. The indemnifying party shall not compromise or settle any third-party action, claim, or suit on terms that shall require any act or forbearance by the indemnified party or that do not include a full and complete release of the indemnified party from all liability in respect of such claim, action, or suit without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Assumption by an indemnifying party of control of any such defense, compromise, or settlement shall not be deemed a waiver by it of its right to challenge its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party; provided, however, that in such event, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the indemnified party for the costs incurred in undertaking such defense. The Buyer, Surviving Corporation, and Shareholders Representative shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation, or settlement of any legal proceeding, claim, or demand referred to in this _Section 4.4_ and shall provide all reasonably necessary access to records and personnel. 

   

 (b) In accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Shareholders shall retain liability for the litigation arising out of the Designated Claim and, as parties obligated to indemnify the Buyer in respect of the same, undertake the defense of such litigation, all in accordance with the foregoing provisions and subject to the limitations and provisions of this _Article IV_. The defense of the Designated Claim shall be accomplished in the sole direction and under the sole control of the Shareholders Representative and toward that end, the Company shall provide to the Shareholders Representative access to Company personnel and records and shall generally cooperate with the Shareholders Representative. 

  

 (c) The obligations of the parties with respect to the defense of the Special Indemnity Claim shall be as described in _Schedule 4.1(e)_. 

  

  

 4.5 Survival and Time Limitations. The representations and warranties made by the Parties shall survive Closing for a period of three (3) years, provided that the representations and warranties made by the Shareholders in the first sentence of _Section 2.1.1_ ("Organization and Standing"), _Section 2.1.2_ ("Capital Structure"), _Section 2.1.3_ ("Authority"), _Section 2.1.26_ ("Authority, Validity and Effect"), and  _Section 2.1.27_ ("Title to Shares") shall survive Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including extensions. Any and all claims or demands made under _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ , regarding breaches of representations and warranties, must be asserted in a Claim Notice delivered to the indemnifying party during the foregoing relevant survival period and may not be made or asserted after such time; provided, however, that the obligation of a party for indemnification claims for which a Claim Notice is given within the time period set forth above shall continue until the final resolution of each such claim. 

        

 4.6 Other Limitations. 

  

  

 (a) The indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 4.1_ or _4.2_ only when the aggregate amount of all Losses from all claims (other than claims subject to the Special Threshold Amount (as defined in the following sentence)) exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "General Threshold Amount"); provided that at such time as the aggregate of all such Losses exceeds the General Threshold Amount, the indemnified party shall only be entitled to be indemnified for all Losses in excess of the General Threshold Amount. The Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in (x) _Section 2.1.14(d)_ (third-party discharge of Hazardous Substances) and (y) _Section 2.1.30_, to the extent the breach of _Section 2.1.30_ arises out of an infringement, misappropriation, or violation of an Intellectual Property Right of any other Person by the Company or a Company Subsidiary that occurred at any time on or prior to Closing, only when the aggregate amount of all Losses from all such claims exceeds Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "Special Threshold Amount"); provided that at such time as the aggregate of all such Losses exceeds the Special Threshold Amount, the indemnified party shall only be entitled to be indemnified for all Losses in excess of the Special Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts payable or owing under the One-Day Notes or by the Parties in respect of an adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of final, conclusive and binding determinations of Debt, Cash, Transaction Expenses or Working Capital under _Section 1.6_ shall not be subject to the General Threshold Amount and shall not be debited against, or reduce, the General Threshold Amount. The General Threshold Amount shall also not apply to any Losses based on (w) any breach of the representations and warranties made by the Shareholders in the first sentence of _Section 2.1.1_ ("Organization and Standing"), _Section 2.1.2_ ("Capital Structure"), _Section 2.1.3_ ("Authority"), _Section 2.1.18_ ("Brokers and Finders"), _Section 2.1.26_ ("Authority, Validity and Effect"), and _Section 2.1.27_ ("Title to Share"), (x) any matters related to the Designated Claim, (y) any matters involving the Special Indemnity Claim, or (z) any actual fraud (the foregoing, items (w), (x), (y) and (z), the "Exception Losses"). For avoidance of doubt, the Special Indemnity Claim shall _not_ be subject to the Special Threshold Amount. 

  

 (b) From and after Closing, the sole and exclusive source of recovery of Buyer Indemnified Parties, and each of them, against Shareholders for monetary damages under _Section 4.1_ or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any losses other than Exception Losses shall be against and from the Escrow Account and Buyer Indemnified Parties, and each of them, shall have no other rights or recourse against Shareholders, or any of them, to recover such monetary damages. 

  

 (c) The sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of the representations and warranties of _Section 2.1.21(c)_ ("Inventory") shall be an adjustment of the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.6_. 

  

 (d) A party shall not be entitled to recover under this _Article IV_ for any Losses to the extent that it has recovered in respect of such Losses pursuant to any policy of insurance or from a third party. 

  

      

  
  

 (e) If an indemnified party has recovered any amount under this _Article IV_ for any Losses and subsequently has recovered in respect of such losses pursuant to any policy of insurance or from a third party, then the indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying party the amount of such recovery. Each indemnified party who has or is entitled to recover any amount under this _Article IV_ for any Losses agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to secure recovery of such Loss from any policy of insurance or available third party. With respect to Product Liability Claims, and with respect to the Specified Insurance Policies and policies the Company has in place as of, immediately prior to or at any time before the Closing Date, the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereby waive any rights of subrogation any insurer or third party might have against the other parties hereto under or through this Agreement. 

  

 (f) The parties agree that all indemnification amounts payable hereunder shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

   

 (g) Subject to the limitation of _Section 4.6(b)_, the liability of each Shareholder for amounts to be paid under this _Article IV_, including amounts to be paid from the Escrow Amount, shall be joint and several. In furtherance of the foregoing, the liability of each Shareholder for each Exception Loss shall be joint and several. 

  

 (h) From and after the Closing, the aggregate liability of the Shareholders under this _Article IV_ for Exception Losses shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price (less all amounts paid out of the Escrow Account for Losses covered thereby). While the remedy and recourse for Exception Losses is, in accordance with _Section 4.6(b)_, _not_ limited to the Escrow Account, Buyer shall be entitled to seek recovery from the Shareholders with respect to the Exception Losses only to the extent the amounts in the Escrow Account, at the time the claim is made and again at the time the claim is finally adjudicated, are less than the amounts claimed, it being the intent of the parties that Exception Losses be first satisfied from the Escrow Account. The foregoing shall however not apply, and shall not limit Buyer\'s recourse with respect to, any Losses in respect of the Special Indemnity Claim once a total of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) has been released from the General Claim Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) in respect of Losses arising out of the Special Indemnity Claim. 

   

 (i) Shareholders shall have no right to contribution or cross-claim against the Surviving Corporation in respect of any amounts required to be released from the Escrow Amount for indemnification pursuant to this _Article IV_. 

  

      

  
  

 (j) The Shareholders shall have no liability under _Sections 2.1.22_ (or under _Section 2.1.30_ or other provisions of Article II, to the extent a breach under such other representation and warranty covers matters specifically covered by _Section 2.1.22_) unless Buyer can reasonably demonstrate that (i) the claimed breach of such representation and warranty involved product manufactured by Company prior to Closing that did not conform to any applicable warranty or other agreement or contract or Applicable Law (rather than, for example, as a remedial measure or expenditure contemplated by the Company for marketing or customer relations purposes) and (ii) the amount of the Loss in question, when combined with other such Losses for failure to conform arising prior to Closing, but not charged against the Company\'s warranty reserves prior to Closing, exceeds the Company\'s $375,000 warranty reserve as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. With respect to breaches of representations and warranties involving a failure of product manufactured by the Company to conform to the Company\'s warranty, the liability of the Shareholders under this Article IV shall be limited to the actual costs (including a reasonable allocation for manufacturing overhead applied in a manner consistent with past practices) incurred by the Company in meeting its warranty obligations. To the extent the Company repairs or replaces products under warranty, Losses for such repair and replacement (and charges against the Company\'s warranty reserve) shall be based on the Company\'s cost of the goods supplied (including a reasonable allocation for manufacturing overhead applied in a manner consistent with past practices), with no mark-up for profit, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

  

  

 4.7 Exclusive Remedy. The sole remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and each of them, and the Shareholders, and each of them, for monetary damages arising from breaches of this Agreement shall be claims made in accordance with and subject to the limitations and procedures of this _Article IV_ and  _Section 5.3_. Pursuant to the foregoing, but without limitation of the foregoing, all claims, whether stated in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to matters the subject of potential indemnification pursuant to this _Article IV_ shall be subject to the thresholds,  limitations on recourse and remedies, procedures and other provisions of this _Article IV_, provided that nothing in the foregoing is intended to limit Buyer\'s recourse or remedies for actual fraud or the Shareholders\' enforcement of the One-Day Notes. 

  

 4.8 Shareholders Representative. As used herein, the term "Shareholders Representative" shall mean Jeffrey S. Sandwith, or, if Jeffrey S. Sandwith dies, resigns, or for any reason refuses or is unable to act, the substitute (which shall be a natural person) specified in a written notice of substitution signed by at least two of the three following persons: Susan Sandwith Crader, David A. Sandwith and Mark A. Sandwith. By signing this Agreement and approving the Merger, the Shareholders have irrevocably made, constituted and appointed the Shareholders Representative as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (a) to do any and all things and execute any and all documents which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to undertake the duties ascribed to the Shareholders Representative under this Agreement and (c) to execute any amendments to this Agreement for any reason deemed appropriate by the Shareholders Representative, in his sole discretion. The Surviving Company and the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon action or inaction by the Shareholders Representative as being fully authorized and approved by and binding upon all of the Shareholders notwithstanding any assertion by any Shareholder to the contrary, it being the purpose and intent of this _Section 4.8_ that Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to treat the Shareholders Representative as if such person were the sole selling Shareholder of all Company Shares. By approving of this Agreement and the Merger, the Shareholders have acknowledged and agreed that the Shareholders Representative shall have no liability to any Shareholder with respect to actions or omissions in his capacity as Shareholders Representative, except to the extent that such actions or omissions are in bad faith or constitute gross negligence. 

        
  

 4.9 Tax Indemnification. 

  

  

 (a) Each Shareholder shall indemnify the Company, subject to the limitations and procedures of this _Article IV_, including the procedures of _Sections 4.3_ and _4.4_ and all of the limitations of _Sections 4.6(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) _ and _(i)_ , each Company Subsidiary and Buyer and hold them harmless from and against, any loss, claim, liability, expense or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and any Company Subsidiary for all Tax periods ending on or before (and including) the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date of any Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), and (ii) any and all Taxes of any person imposed on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Shareholder shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in determining the adjustment to Working Capital. The Shareholders shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are the responsibility of the Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 4.9_ within thirty (30) business days after the later of payment of such Taxes by Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the date Shareholders receive notice of such payment by Buyer, Company or Company Subsidiary; provided that, in the event that the Shareholders elect to contest any claim for Taxes and payment of such Taxes are not a condition of such contest, the Shareholders shall reimburse Buyer at the time of any determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) with respect to such Tax. Amounts received by Buyer or the Company as refunds of Taxes indemnified against hereunder by the Shareholders shall be paid to the Shareholders within thirty (30) days of receipt of such amounts. 

  

 (b) In the case of any Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or any employment, sales or use Taxes, for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the Close of Business, which shall include the effect of the deemed sale of assets as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election (and for such purpose, the Tax period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount of other Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period including _ad valorem_ tax payable during the Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 5.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be modified rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to this Agreement to the extent possible. In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent. 

        
  

 5.6 Assignment. No party to this Agreement may assign, by operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights, obligations, or liabilities under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement, which consent may be withheld in the absolute discretion of the party asked to grant such consent, provided that nothing herein is intended to prevent the Shareholders from assigning any rights they have in respect of the Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agreement, the One-Day Note, or other payments to be made in respect of the Purchase Price after the Closing. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 5.5_ shall be voidable and shall entitle the other party to this Agreement to terminate this Agreement at its option. 

  

 5.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more partially or fully executed counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and shall bind the signatory, but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. The execution and delivery of a "Signature PageMerger Agreement" in the form annexed to this Agreement by any party hereto who shall have been furnished the final form of this Agreement shall constitute the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such party. 

  

 5.8 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative. No signature of any Shareholder (other than the Shareholders Representative) shall be required to effect any amendment to this Agreement. 

  

 5.9 Interpretation. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, references to the plural include the singular, to the singular include the plural and to the part include the whole. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereunder," and similar terms in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole, including exhibits and schedules hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes," and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation," and the term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the term "and/or." The table of contents, index to defined terms, and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 5.10 Confidentiality. The Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement of June 22, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") between the Company and Buyer shall be terminated effective as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, each party agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that (i) this obligation shall not apply to information in the public domain through no fault of the disclosing party, and (ii) a party shall be entitled to disclose this Agreement and its terms and conditions, to its accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and other appropriate advisors, and prospective transferees of rights hereunder, so long as such persons are directed to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.10_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing herein shall prohibit a party from (i) issuing a press release or other announcement, or making public disclosure if required by statute, laws or regulations, or by the rules of a stock exchange, provided that (x) the party issuing or making such release, announcement or public disclosure has been advised by legal counsel that such disclosure is in fact required or advisable, (y) the Shareholders Representative is advised as soon as possible of such required press release, announcement or public disclosure, and (z) the party making the required or advised press release, announcement, or public disclosure provides to the Shareholders Representative a pre-release copy of 

        
  

the proposed release, announcement, or public disclosure, provides him a
reasonable period of time to comment on the same, and makes any changes
reasonably requested by the Shareholders Representative or (ii) divulging
such information in connection with any legal proceeding initiated by a third
party or Governmental Entity against such party or in compliance with
applicable requirements of law, provided that such party shall provide the
non-disclosing party with prompt written notice prior to such disclosure so
that the non-disclosing party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this _Section 5.10_.
If such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the non-
disclosing party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the disclosing
party agrees to disclose only that portion of the confidential information
which the disclosing party is advised by the written opinion of outside
counsel that is legally required to be disclosed.

  

 5.11 Beneficiaries. Except as provided in _Article IV_, this Agreement is not intended to benefit any person who is not a party to this Agreement. 

   

 5.12 Accounting Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, all accounting terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in conformity with GAAP.

Exhibit B 

  

    
ESCROW AGREEMENT 

  

 THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Escrow Agreement") is made and entered into as of December 9, 2004 (such date, the "Closing Date"), by and among Quanex Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), Quanex Four, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Sub"), the undersigned shareholders (the "Shareholders") of Mikron Industries, Inc., a Washington corporation ("Company"), Jeff Sandwith, as representative of the Shareholders (the "Shareholders Representative"), and Bank of America, N.A., as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). 

  

    
Recitals 

  

 A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, Sub, Company and the Shareholders have entered into a Merger Agreement dated the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), setting forth certain terms and conditions pursuant to which Sub is being merged with and into Company (the "Merger") on the date hereof and, following the Merger, Buyer will be the sole shareholder of Company. Escrow Agent, by execution hereof, acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 B. Pursuant to _Section 1.4_ of the Merger Agreement, a total of Twenty-six Million Six Hundred Three Thousand Two Hundred Twenty Three and 53/100 Dollars ($26,603,223.53) (the "Escrow Funds") is being deposited by Buyer into escrow under this Escrow Agreement to satisfy any claims by Buyer for (i) any adjustments in respect of final determinations in favor of Buyer of Debt, Transactional Expenses, Cash and Working Capital of the Company as of Closing pursuant to _Section 1.6_ of the Merger Agreement and any fees and expenses related to Accounting Arbitrator proceedings that Shareholders are responsible for pursuant to _Section 1.6_ of the Merger Agreement, (ii) indemnification pursuant to _Sections 4.1(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ of the Merger Agreement (all claims and adjustments made pursuant to subsections (i) and (ii), "General Claims"), and (iii) for indemnification against the Designated Claim pursuant to _Sections 4.1(c)_ and _4.4(b)_ of the Merger Agreement (the General Claims and the Designated Claim, collectively referred to herein as "Claims," as further defined in Section 2.2 below), on the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein. 

  

 C. Unless otherwise indicated herein, all terms beginning with an initial capital letter shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and in this Escrow Agreement, the parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW 

  

 1.1 Deposit of Escrow Funds; Establishment of Accounts. 

  

  

 (a) Buyer hereby deposits the Escrow Funds with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Funds and agrees to hold, invest and disburse the Escrow Funds in and from a separate account (the "Escrow Account") as provided in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Funds during the term of this Escrow Agreement, shall treat the Escrow Funds as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement and not as the property of Buyer, Sub, the Company, the Shareholders or the Shareholders Representative, and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Funds only in accordance with the terms hereof. The amounts held in the Escrow Account shall, in accordance with Section 1.1(b), be held in two separate sub-accounts, in respect of the General Claim Fund and the Designated Claim Fund (both as defined below).     

  

 (b) Twenty Million and No/100 Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of the Escrow Funds shall be placed in a sub-account and shall be available to indemnify Buyer for General Claims, as further set forth herein (the "General Claim Fund"). Six Million Six Hundred Three Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-three and 53/100 Dollars ($6,603,223.53) of the Escrow Funds shall be placed in a sub-account and shall be available to indemnify Buyer for the Designated Claim (except as provided in Section 2.1(b)), as further set forth herein (the "Designated Claim Fund"). For avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Funds in the General Claim Fund shall _not_ be available to satisfy the Designated Claim and the Escrow Fund in the Designated Claim Fund shall _not_ be available to satisfy General Claims.  

  

  

 1.2 No Encumbrance. None of the Escrow Funds or any beneficial interest therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law, by Buyer, Sub, the Company, the Shareholders or the Shareholders Representative or may be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of Buyer, Sub, the Company, the Shareholders or the Shareholders Representative, prior to the release of the Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 1.3 Power to Transfer Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent is hereby granted the power to effect any transfer of the Escrow Funds provided for in this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 1.4. Investment of Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in: (a) interest bearing bank account(s) of federally-insured banks, (b) investments of the type set forth on _Exhibit A_, or (c) such other investments as Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may jointly authorize the Escrow Agent to make from time to time. All interest or other earnings derived from the Escrow Funds shall become part of the Escrow Funds, shall be treated as Escrow Funds, shall be subject to release only as Escrow Funds, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms hereof. Interest and other earnings in respect of the General Claim Fund and the Designated Claim Fund, respectively, shall become part of such fund, shall be treated as such fund, and shall be subject to release only as part of such fund. 

  

 1.5 Taxes. 

  

  

 (a) Buyer shall report all interest generated by the Escrow Funds on its income tax returns, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8 or as otherwise required in final Treasury Regulations under Section 468B of the Code. Buyer, Sub, the Shareholders, the Shareholder Representative, and the Escrow Agent shall all refrain from taking any position on any U.S. federal, state, or local income tax return inconsistent with this Section. The Escrow Agent shall report the income attributable to the Escrow Account consistent with this Section. 

  

 (b) The release of amounts to the Shareholders pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement shall be treated as the payment of installment obligations and original issue discount shall accrue thereon in accordance with the principles of Section 1274 of the Code. Buyer shall timely deliver to the Shareholders a properly completed Form 1099-OID with respect to such imputed interest. 

  

  

 2. ESCROW CLAIMS 

  

 2.1 Obligations. 

  

  

 (a) Pursuant to the above provisions, the parties have agreed that any release to Buyer of any of the Escrow Funds shall be treated as a further post-Closing adjustment of the Purchase Price paid by Buyer under the Merger Agreement. Such adjustment may potentially require an amendment of such parties\' tax returns and financial statements, as applicable. 

  

      

  

 (b) In addition to providing indemnification for the Designated Claim, the Designated Claim Fund is also intended to provide a source of funding, prior to the final disposition thereof, for professional fees, costs, and expenses actually incurred by the Company in connection with its defense or any settlement thereof, under the sole direction and under the sole control of the Shareholders Representative. Toward that end, the Shareholders Representative, acting as agent for the Company, shall be entitled to withdraw from the Designated Claim Fund, prior to the final disposition of the Designated Claim, up to a maximum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) in professional fees, costs, and expenses actually incurred in connection with the defense of the Designated Claim, and Buyer agrees to execute, following receipt of written documentation evidencing in reasonable detail such fees, costs and expenses, joint instructions providing for any such release. Buyer further agrees to execute within ten (10) days of request joint instructions with Shareholders Representative providing for a release of the funds from the Designated Claim Fund, payable in accordance with the instructions of the Shareholders Representative, in connection with (i) any settlement of the Designated Claim that fully releases the Company from further liability or (ii) payment on any judgment that results in a full release of the Company from further liability. 

   

 (c) In addition to providing indemnification for the General Claims, the General Claim Fund is also intended to provide a source of funding for up to $1,000,000 of obligations and liabilities (including attorney and expert fees and costs as well as settlement payments) which in the Shareholders Representative\'s sole discretion are reasonable for the conduct or settlement of the Marley Mouldings Litigation. Toward that end, the Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to withdraw from the General Claim Fund, prior to the final disposition of the Marley Mouldings Litigation, up to a maximum of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for such purposes, and Buyer agrees to execute joint instructions providing for any such release within ten (10) days following receipt of written request from the Shareholders Representative. 

  

  

 2.2 Claim Notices. Promptly after the receipt by Buyer of notice or discovery of any claim, damage, or legal action or proceeding giving rise to rights under _Section 1.6_ or _Article IV_ of the Merger Agreement (a "Claim"), Buyer shall give the Shareholders Representative written notice of such Claim setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and, if specifiable, the dollar amount of such Claim and shall provide a copy of such notice to the Escrow Agent; provided, however, that the failure of Buyer to give such a notice shall not relieve the parties hereto from their obligations hereunder unless that failure materially prejudices the Shareholders in the defense of any such Claim by such party. Each notice of a Claim by Buyer (the "Claim Notice") shall be in writing and must be delivered on or before the General Escrow Release Date (in the case of General Claims) or the Designated Escrow Release Date (in the case of the Designated Claim) to be valid hereunder. When making a Claim, Buyer shall identify whether it is a General Claim or a Designated Claim and, if not so identified, it shall be presumed to be a General Claim. Upon receipt of a Claim Notice by Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall provide a copy of such notice to the Shareholders Representative. 

   

 2.3 Resolution of Claims. Any Claim Notice received by the Shareholders Representative and the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 above shall be resolved as follows: 

  

  

 2.3.1 Uncontested Claims. In the event that the Shareholders Representative (i) provides written notice to the Escrow Agent that it does not contest a Claim Notice or (ii) does not contest, in the manner provided for at Section 2.3.2, a Claim Notice in writing within thirty (30) days of his receipt of the Claim Notice from Escrow Agent, as provided for in Section 2.2, the Escrow Agent shall promptly take all steps to release the relevant portion of Escrow Funds to Buyer from the General Claim Fund or the Designated Claim Fund, as applicable. 

  

       

 2.3.2 Contested Claims. In the event that the Shareholders Representative gives written notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent contesting all or a portion of a Claim Notice (a "Contested Claim") within the thirty (30) day period provided above, the matter shall be settled in accordance with this Section 2.3.2. Any portion of a Claim Notice that is not contested shall be resolved as set forth above in Section 2.3.1. If notice is received by the Escrow Agent that a Claim Notice is contested by the Shareholders Representative or if any dispute exists with respect to an amount to be distributed under Section 2.3.1, then the Escrow Agent shall hold in the General Claim Fund or Designated Claim Fund, as applicable, after what would otherwise be the applicable Partial Escrow Release Date or General Escrow Release Date (in the case of General Claims) or Designated Release Date (in the case of Designated Claims), the amount of Escrow Funds, as specified in the Claim Notice or as otherwise provided in Section 3.1, until the earlier of: (i) receipt of joint instructions executed by Buyer and the Shareholders Representative setting forth a resolution of the Claim Notice and the portion of Escrow Funds to be delivered to Buyer and, if a Partial Escrow Release Date or Escrow Release Date has occurred with respect to the applicable fund against which the Claim was made, the portion (if any) of the Escrow Funds to be delivered to the Shareholders (such joint instructions, "Joint Instructions"); (ii) receipt of a written notice from Buyer (a "Buyer Distribution Notice") attaching a copy of the final award or decision of the court or Accounting Arbitrator and setting forth the portion of Escrow Funds to be delivered to Buyer (Buyer shall at the same time provide a copy of the Buyer Distribution Notice to the Shareholders Representative); or (iii) receipt of a written notice from the Shareholders Representative (a "Representative Distribution Notice") attaching a copy of the final award or decision of the court or Accounting Arbitrator that no portion of Escrow Funds is to be delivered to Buyer as a result of such award (Shareholder Representatives shall at the same time provide a copy of the Representative Distribution Notice to Buyer). Promptly upon receipt of a Buyer Distribution Notice, Escrow Agent shall provide a copy of such notice to the Shareholders Representative. Promptly upon receipt of a Representative Distribution Notice, Escrow Agent shall provide a copy of such notice to Buyer. The following sets forth actions to be taken by the Escrow Agent in the following situations: 

  

  

 (x) Upon receipt of Joint Instructions, Escrow Agent shall within five (5) days release Escrow Funds in accordance with such Joint Instructions. 

  

 (y) If a Buyer Distribution Notice is given, the Escrow Agent shall, no earlier than ten (10) days and no later than fifteen (15) days after it gives notice of the Buyer Distribution Notice to the Shareholders Representative, release to Buyer the portion of the Escrow Funds to which the Buyer Distribution Notice relates. If the Buyer Distribution Notice occurs after a Partial Escrow Release Date or an Escrow Release Date has occurred with respect to the relevant fund against which the Claim was made, and the Buyer Distribution Notice requires distribution of only a portion of the amount then held in escrow for the relevant Claim, then the balance of the relevant Escrow Funds shall be released, but only up to the extent that Escrow Agent would have released such amount on the applicable Partial Escrow Release Date or Escrow Release Date, as the case may be, if such Claim had not been pending. If the relevant Partial Escrow Release Date has not occurred, the aforementioned portion of the Escrow Funds shall continue to be held pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

      

  
  

 (z) If a Representative Distribution Notice has been given and a Partial Escrow Release Date or Escrow Release Date has occurred with respect to the applicable fund against which the Claim was made, the Escrow Agent shall, no earlier than ten (10) and no later than fifteen (15) days after it gives notice of the Representative Distribution Notice to the Buyer, release to the Shareholders, the portion of the Escrow Funds to which the Representative Distribution Notice relates, but only to the extent that the Escrow Agent would have released such amount on the applicable Partial Escrow Release Date or Escrow Release Date, as the case may be, if such Claim had not been pending. If the relevant Partial Escrow Release Date or Escrow Release Date has not occurred, notwithstanding any Representative Distribution Notice, the aforementioned portion of the Escrow Funds shall continue to be held pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

  

 All releases in response to Joint Instructions, a Buyer Distribution Notice, or a Representative Distribution Notice shall be made only from the General Escrow Fund or Designated Fund, as applicable. 

  

 3. RELEASE FROM ESCROW 

  

 3.1 Release of Escrow Funds. 

  

  

 (a) (i) Within five (5) days of receipt of the Final Purchase Price Calculation under _Section 1.6_ of the Merger Agreement (or, if not a business day, the next business day following the tenth day), the Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall, in the event that the Purchase Price shown on the Final Purchase Price Calculation is less than the Purchase Price paid by Buyer on the Closing Date, give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to transfer to Buyer from the Escrow Funds in the General Claim Fund an amount equal to such difference. If there is such a shortfall and no such instruction is given to the Escrow Agent within the time prescribed, then the Escrow Agent shall, no earlier than ten (10) and no later than fifteen (15) days from delivery by Buyer of the determination of the Accounting Arbitration referenced below, transfer to the Buyer from the Escrow Funds in the General Claim Fund an amount equal to such shortfall, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 1.6_ of the Merger Agreement upon delivery by Buyer of the Final Purchase Price Calculation prepared by such Accounting Arbitrator and the Accounting Arbitrator\'s determination of the shortfall between the Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price Calculation. Upon delivery of the Buyer of such determination to the Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall promptly give notice of the same to the Shareholders Representative. 

  

 (ii) Within five (5) days of receipt of a decision of the Accounting Arbitrator requiring that Shareholders pay for fees and expenses in connection with proceedings before the Accounting Arbitrator, the Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to transfer to Accounting Arbitrator and Buyer from the Escrow Funds in the General Claim Fund an amount equal to such fees and costs awarded against Shareholders. If there has been such award by the Accounting Arbitrator and no such instruction is given to the Escrow Agent within the time prescribed, then the Escrow Agent shall no earlier than ten (10) and no later than fifteen (15) days from delivery of the award by the Accounting Arbitrator referenced below, transfer to the Accounting Arbitrator and Buyer from the Escrow Funds in the General Claim Fund, as specified in the award of the Accounting Arbitrator, an amount equal to such award, upon delivery by Buyer of the award by the Accounting Arbitrator with respect to the fees and costs to be paid by Shareholders. Upon delivery by Buyer of such award to the Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall promptly give notice of the same to the Shareholders Representative. 

  

      

  
  

 (b) If the amount in the General Claim Fund on a Partial Escrow Release Date (as defined below) exceeds the sum of the related Applicable Balance (as defined below) on such Partial Escrow Release Date and the amount of any unresolved General Claims as of such Partial Escrow Release Date, then the Escrow Agent shall release to the Shareholders the amount of that excess. For purposes of this Section 3.1(b), the "Partial Escrow Release Dates" and the related "Applicable Balances" are as follows: 

 

  

  Partial Escrow 
 Release Date 

* * *

 |  | Applicable Balance

* * *

  
---|---|--- 
  January 2, 2006 |  | $ | 13,333,332.00  
  January 2, 2007 |  | $ | 6,666,666.00

 (b) _Dividends and Other Distributions_.

 6. _Remedies_. 

  

  

 (a) Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the option of the Pledgees, any or all of the Secured Obligations shall be immediately matured and shall become immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, notice of nonpayment, protest, notice of protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or any notice to Pledgor or any other person obligated thereon, and the Pledgees shall have and may exercise with reference to the Collateral and Secured Obligations any or all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC, and as otherwise granted herein or under any applicable law or under any other agreement executed by Pledgor, including, without limitation, the right and power to sell, at public or private sale or sales, or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise utilize the Collateral and any part or parts thereof in any manner authorized or permitted under said UCC after default by a debtor, and to apply the proceeds thereof toward payment of any costs and expenses and attorney\'s fees and legal expenses thereby incurred by the Pledgees and toward payment of the Secured Obligations, all in such order or manner as the Pledgees may in good faith determine, and the Pledgor expressly waives any notice of sale or other disposition of the Collateral and all other rights or remedies of Pledgor, or formalities prescribed by law relative to sale or disposition of the Collateral or exercise of any other right or remedy of Pledgees existing after an Event of Default; and to the extent any such notice is required and cannot be waived, Pledgor agrees that if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Pledgor at the mailing address shown below for Pledgor, at least five days before the time of such sale or disposition, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and shall fully satisfy any requirement for giving of said notice. 

  

      

  

 (b) Pledgees are expressly granted the right, upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to retain for or transfer to themselves or to their nominee, the Collateral, or any part thereof, and to receive the distributions, payments, collections, monies, income, proceeds, and benefits attributable or accruing thereto and to hold the same as security for the Secured Obligations or to apply it on the principal and interest and other amounts owing on any of the Secured Obligations, in such order or manner as Pledgees may elect. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) all rights of Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in Pledgees which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights, and (ii) all rights of Pledgor to receive distributions of the Company, if any, and any other instrument or other distribution which Pledgor would otherwise be authorized to receive pursuant hereto or pursuant to any other written agreement shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon be vested in Pledgees which shall thereupon have the right to receive and hold as Collateral (or to apply same toward satisfaction of the Secured Obligations) all distributions and other proceeds of Collateral. 

  

 (c) All rights to marshalling of assets of Pledgor, including any such right with respect to the Collateral, are hereby waived by Pledgor. 

  

 (d) All recitals in any instrument of assignment or any other instrument executed by Pledgees incident to sale, lease, transfer, assignment or other disposition, or utilization of the Collateral or any part thereof hereunder shall be full proof of the matters stated therein and no other proof shall be requisite to establish full legal propriety of the sale or other action taken by Pledgees or of any fact, condition or thing incident thereto and all prerequisites of such sale or other action or of any fact, condition or thing incident thereto shall be presumed conclusively to have been performed or to have occurred. 

  

 (e) The right of Pledgees to take possession or control of the Collateral upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default may be exercised without resort to any court proceeding or judicial process whatever and without any hearing whatever thereon. 

  

 (f) Pledgor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Pledgees and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Pledgor and in the name of Pledgor or in their own name, from time to time, upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in Pledgees\' discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument which Pledgee may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement, including, without limitation, to receive, endorse and collect all instruments made payable to Pledgor representing any interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same. Pledgor hereby ratifies all that said attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the Collateral shall be subject to the security interest granted hereunder. The powers conferred on Pledgees hereunder are solely to protect the interests of Pledgees in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon Pledgees to exercise any of such powers. 

  

 (g) Pledgor further authorizes Pledgees, at any time and from time to time to execute, in connection with any sale provided for hereunder, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to Collateral. 

  

      

  
  

 (h) Pledgor acknowledges that Pledgees may be unable to effect a public sale of some or all the Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in (to the extent applicable) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") and applicable state securities laws, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution and resale thereof. Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if the sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding the circumstances, agrees that any private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. Pledgees shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the registration of the securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws. Pledgor shall use its reasonable best efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such Collateral pursuant to this agreement valid and binding and in compliance with any and all laws. 

  

  

 7. _Exoneration of Pledgees_. Pledgees shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any agent or bailee selected by Pledgees in good faith. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement or any agreement related hereto, Pledgees shall not have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not Pledgees has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve any rights against any parties with respect to any Collateral. Pledgees shall have no duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in their possession other than as set forth in Section 9.207 of the UCC. 

  

 8. _Waiver_. No delay on Pledgees\' part in exercising any power of sale or other right hereunder, and no notice or demand which may be given to or made upon Pledgor by Pledgees with respect to any power of sale or other right hereunder, shall constitute a waiver thereof, or limit or impair Pledgees\' right to take any action or to exercise any power of sale or any other right hereunder, without notice or demand, or prejudice Pledgees\' rights as against Pledgor in any respect. 

  

 9. _Assignment_. Neither Pledgor nor any of the Pledgees may assign their rights under this Agreement. 

   

 10. _Termination_. On the day (the " _Termination Date"_ ) of payment, defeasance or other retirement of all amounts due under the Notes, the Lien hereof in the Collateral, all other rights, claims and interests of Pledgees in and to the Collateral and all obligations of Pledgor hereunder shall fully and finally terminate and be forever released, without further act or step by or on behalf of any Person. At any time or after the Termination Date, Pledgees shall, at Pledgor\'s request and expense, so deliver to Pledgor the Collateral at the time subject to this Agreement and all instruments of transfer executed in connection therewith, free and clear of the Lien hereof, all other rights, claims and interests of Pledgees hereunder and all of Pledgor\'s obligations hereunder. 

   

 11. _Expenses_. Pledgor will reimburse Pledgees for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal expenses) reasonably incurred by them for the enforcement against Pledgor for its failure to perform any of its covenants as expressly provided in _Section 5_ hereof, which amounts (until paid) shall be included in the Secured Obligations. 

  

 12. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

  

 (a) Pledgees may execute any of their duties hereunder by or through agents or employees selected by them in good faith. Pledgees may consult with legal counsel and any action taken or suffered in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel shall be full justification and protection to them. 

  

 (b) Neither Pledgees nor any of their officers, directors, employees, agents or counsel shall be liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by them or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law. 

  

      

  
  

 (c) This Agreement shall be binding upon Pledgor and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Pledgees and their successors, heirs, legal representatives and permitted transferees and assigns, _provided however_ , neither Pledgor nor any of the Pledgees may assign any of its rights hereunder or interests herein without the prior written consent of the other parties. None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, modified or amended except in writing duly signed for and on behalf of Pledgees and Pledgor. 

  

 (d) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE. With respect to matters arising under this Agreement or the Note, the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit resolution of the dispute to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California and, in any such action or proceeding, consent to jurisdiction in such courts and waive any objection to the venue in any such court. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_. 

  

 (e) This Agreement, together with the Notes, contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 (f) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same agreement. 

  

 (g) The rights, powers and remedies of Pledgees under this Agreement are cumulative and shall be in addition to all rights, powers and remedies available to Pledgees pursuant to the Notes and at law or in equity, all of which rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised successively or concurrently without impairing Pledgees\' rights hereunder. 

  

  

 13. _Further Assurances; Pledgees May Perform_. Pledgor agrees that at any time and from time to time, at Pledgees\' cost and expense, it will promptly procure, execute and deliver all further instruments, documents and agreements, and take all further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Pledgees may reasonably request, in order to establish, maintain, preserve, protect and perfect the Collateral, any security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby and the priority and perfection of such security interest, or to enable Pledgees to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pledgor further agrees that it shall, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and at any time and from time to time thereafter (i) procure, execute and deliver to Pledgees all stock powers, endorsements, financing statements, assignments and other instruments of transfer requested by Pledgees and (ii) deliver to Pledgees immediately upon receipt the originals of all Pledged Securities.

 (b) For a period of three years after the Closing, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, either for himself or any other person, (A) induce or attempt to induce any employee of Mikron to leave the employ of Mikron, (B) in any way interfere with the relationship between Mikron, on the one hand, and any employee of Mikron, on the other hand or (C) employ, or otherwise engage as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, any person who is an employee of Mikron as of the Closing Date unless, as of the time of engagement, such person has been out of the employ of Mikron for at least six (6) months, provided that nothing in this Section 3(b) is intended to restrict the solicitation or hiring of any sibling of the Stockholder. 

  

 (c) If Stockholder breaches any covenant set forth in Subsection 3(a), the term of this Agreement will be extended by the period of the duration of that breach as to the specific customer or customers that are the subject of the breach. 

  

      

  
 

 

 4.

 DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
  

 As an inducement for Purchaser and Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions described in the Merger Agreement, Stockholder agrees that: 

  

 (a) Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that Stockholder has had access to confidential information of Mikron or of certain corporations or other entities affiliated with Mikron, and that all such information constitutes valuable, special and unique property of Mikron and its affiliates. Stockholder agrees that Stockholder will not, without the prior written consent of Mikron, use or disclose or authorize or permit anyone under Stockholder\'s direction to use or disclose to anyone not properly entitled thereto any of such confidential information. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, persons properly entitled to such information shall be the respective Boards of Directors of Mikron and Purchaser and such officers, employees and agents of Mikron or any affiliate thereof, including Purchaser, to whom such information is furnished in the normal course of business under established policies approved by Mikron. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to information that is in the public domain through no fault of the Stockholder or to information the undersigned obtains from a third party with no restriction on use. The foregoing restrictions are also not intended to prevent appropriate use or disclosure of such information in defending the Stockholder (or his or her related trust) in any claim that may be made by Quanex or its affiliates against the Stockholder under the Merger Agreement or in defending the Stockholder in any tax or other claim, controversy, or matter arising out of Stockholder\'s status as former stockholder of Mikron, so long as in connection with such defense, the disclosure of the information is limited to litigation professionals hired by the Stockholder who are under an obligation of confidentiality or to disclosure to other parties to the proceeding under an appropriate protective order or similar arrangement. Mikron and Quanex acknowledge that the transactional related attorney client privileged materials referred to at Section 3.5 of the Merger Agreement are not confidential information of Mikron. 

   

 (b) In the event that Stockholder: (i) is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents and legal proceedings, interrogatories, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose such information of Mikron or (ii) if Stockholder is advised by its legal counsel in connection with any transaction involving it that it is legally required to disclose any of such information; it is agreed that Stockholder: (A) will provide Mikron and Quanex prompt notice of any request or requirement; (B) will provide Mikron and Quanex full and complete cooperation to seek an appropriate order or remedy; (C) will cooperate with Mikron and Quanex in obtaining reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosure of such information and (D) will, if disclosure of such information is required, disclose only that portion of such information which is legally required to be disclosed. Stockholder shall not be liable for disclosure of such information hereunder under a regulation or to a tribunal compelling such disclosure, if Stockholder has complied with the notice and cooperation provisions of this paragraph, unless such disclosure to such tribunal is caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by Stockholder not permitted by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Stockholder further agrees that Stockholder will not take with Stockholder or retain, without the prior written authorization of Mikron, any papers, software, source codes, procedural or technical manuals, customer lists, customer account analyses (including, without limitation, accounts receivable agings, customer payment histories and customer account activity reports), price books, files or other documents or copies thereof belonging to Mikron or to any affiliate of Mikron, or any materials, supplies, equipment or furnishings belonging to Mikron or to any affiliate of Mikron, or any other confidential information of any kind belonging to Mikron or any affiliate of Mikron. 

        
 

 5.

 REMEDIES 
  

 If Stockholder breaches the covenants set forth in Section 3 or Section 4, Purchaser and Mikron will be entitled to the following remedies: 

  

 (a) monetary damages; and 

  

 (b) in addition to its right to damages and any other rights it may have, injunctive or other equitable relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce the provisions of Section 3 and Section 4, it being agreed that money damages alone would be inadequate to compensate Purchaser and Mikron and would be an inadequate remedy for such breach. 

  

 The rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not alternative. 

  

 6.

 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS 
  

 This Agreement will be binding on Purchaser, Mikron and Stockholder and will inure to the benefit of Purchaser, Mikron and their respective affiliates, successors and assigns, and Stockholder and his assigns, heirs and legal representatives. 

  

 7.

 WAIVER 
  

 No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand by a party to this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party to take further action without notice or demand. 

  

 8.

 GOVERNING LAW 
  

 This Agreement will be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles of any jurisdiction. 

  

 9.

 SEVERABILITY 
  

 Whenever possible each provision and term of this Agreement will be interpreted in a manner to be effective and valid but if any provision or term of this Agreement is held to be prohibited or invalid, then the provision or term will be ineffective only to the extent of the applicable prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or affecting the remainder of the provision or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement. Upon a determination that any provision or term of this Agreement is prohibited or invalid, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible. If any of the covenants set forth in Section 3 or Section 4 are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, it is the intention of the parties that the applicable covenants shall not be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render them valid and enforceable. 

  

 10.

 COUNTERPARTS 
  

 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

 ENTIRE AGREEMENT 
  

 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements and understandings between Stockholder, Mikron and Purchaser with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is not intended to supersede the existing employee confidentiality and non-compete agreement that Mikron has in place with the Stockholder, but rather is intended to provide a broader and longer set of non-compete, non-solicit and non-disclosure provisions applicable to the Stockholder. In the event of a conflict between such employee confidentiality and non-compete agreement and this Agreement, Mikron and Quanex shall be entitled to benefit from the provision that is most protective of Mikron. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by Stockholder, Mikron and Purchaser or except with respect to any deemed amendment pursuant to Section 9\. 

  

 14.

 EFFECTIVENESS 
  

 This Agreement shall become effective at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement). 

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first above written.

Exhibit G 

  

    
AMENDMENT TO LEASE 

  

 THIS AMENDMENT TO LEASE ("Amendment") is made and entered into as of December , 2004, by and between the , a Washington general partnership ("Landlord") and MIKRON INDUSTRIES, INC., a Washington corporation ("Tenant") with reference to the following facts: 

  

 A. Pursuant to that certain lease between Tenant and (Landlord\'s predecessor in interest) dated , as amended (the "Lease"), Tenant leases from Landlord those certain premises consisting of (the "Existing Premises"), as more particularly described in  _Exhibit A_, attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the same meanings set forth in the Lease. 

  

 B. Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the Lease to provide Tenant with an option to extend the term of the Lease. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: 

   

 1. EXTENSION OPTION. Tenant shall have the option to extend the term of this Lease for five (5) years ending on February 28, 2015 (the "Extension Term") upon the same terms and conditions (except that the Rental, as provided for in Section 3 of the Lease, shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 2 below) contained in the Lease ("Tenant\'s Option"). Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of its election to exercise Tenant\'s Option ("Tenant\'s Notice") no later than February 28, 2009. If Tenant fails to timely give Tenant\'s Notice, Tenant\'s Option shall be null and void and of no further force and effect. 

   

 2. EXTENSION TERM RENT. The giving of Tenant\'s Notice by Tenant pursuant to Section 1 above shall be sufficient to make this Lease binding for the Extension Term without further act of the parties, who shall then be bound to take the steps required in the determination of the Rental as specified herein. The Rental (as provided for in Section 3 of the Lease) for each Extension Term shall be the fair market rental value of the Premises upon commencement of the Extension Term. In determining the fair market rental value of the Premises, consideration shall be given to the then current market rate for similar properties in the general vicinity of the Premises with similar lease provisions. If the parties do not agree upon the Rental by October 31, 2009 (the "Trigger Date"), the Rental shall be determined by arbitration. The parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator within ten (10) days after the Trigger Date. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within such 10-day period, then either party may seek appointment of an arbitrator by the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of King County, Washington. Within thirty (30) days after the arbitrator\'s appointment, each party shall submit its estimate of the fair market rental value of the Premises along with any documentary evidence that it may have supporting its estimate. Within fourteen (14) days after the arbitrator\'s receipt of each party\'s estimate and evidence, if any, the arbitrator shall select the estimate that he or she determines is closest to the actual fair market rental value of the Premises. The determination of the estimate that is closest to the actual fair market value of the Premises by the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The cost of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. In no event shall the fair market rental for the Premises be less than the Rental due under the Lease during the last month prior to the Extension Term. 

  

 3. RATIFICATION. Except as modified herein, the Lease shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 4. MISCELLANEOUS. This Amendment shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. This Amendment may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Amendment as of the date first above written.
