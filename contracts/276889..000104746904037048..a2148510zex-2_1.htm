warranty involved product manufactured by Company prior to Closing that did not conform to any applicable warranty or other agreement or contract or Applicable Law (rather than, for example, as a
remedial measure or expenditure contemplated by the Company for marketing or customer relations purposes) and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of the Loss in question, when combined with other such Losses for
failure to conform arising prior to Closing, but not charged against the Company's warranty reserves prior to Closing, exceeds the Company's $375,000 warranty reserve as reflected on the Closing

Shareholders under this Article&nbsp;IV shall be limited to the actual costs (including a reasonable allocation for manufacturing overhead applied in a manner consistent with past practices)
incurred by the Company in meeting its warranty obligations. To the extent the Company repairs or replaces products under warranty, Losses for such repair and replacement (and charges against the
Company's warranty reserve) shall be based on the Company's cost of the goods supplied (including a reasonable allocation for manufacturing overhead applied in a manner consistent with past

OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
an inducement for Purchaser and Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions described in the Merger Agreement, Stockholder agrees that: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockholder
recognizes and acknowledges that Stockholder has had access to confidential information of Mikron or of certain corporations or other entities affiliated
with Mikron, and that all such information constitutes valuable, special and unique property of Mikron and its affiliates. Stockholder agrees that Stockholder will not, without the prior written
consent of Mikron, use or disclose or authorize or permit anyone under Stockholder's direction to use or disclose to anyone not properly entitled thereto any of such confidential information. For
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, persons properly entitled to such information shall be the respective Boards of Directors of Mikron and Purchaser and such officers, employees and
agents of Mikron or any affiliate thereof, including Purchaser, to whom such information is furnished in the normal course of business under established policies approved by Mikron. The foregoing
restrictions shall not apply to information that is in the public domain through no fault of the Stockholder or to information the undersigned obtains from a third party with no restriction on use.
The foregoing restrictions are also not intended to prevent appropriate use or disclosure of such information in defending the Stockholder (or his or her related trust) in any claim that may be made
by Quanex or its affiliates against the Stockholder under the Merger Agreement or in defending the Stockholder in any tax or other claim, controversy, or matter arising out of Stockholder's status as
former stockholder of Mikron, so long as in connection with such defense, the disclosure of the information is limited to litigation professionals hired by the Stockholder who are under an obligation
of confidentiality or to disclosure to other parties to the proceeding under an appropriate protective order or similar arrangement. Mikron and Quanex acknowledge that the transactional related
attorney client privileged materials referred to at Section&nbsp;3.5 of the Merger Agreement are not confidential information of Mikron. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that Stockholder: (i)&nbsp;is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents and legal proceedings, interrogatories,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose such information of Mikron or (ii)&nbsp;if Stockholder is advised by its legal counsel in connection with any transaction
involving it that it is legally required to disclose any of such information; it is agreed that Stockholder: (A)&nbsp;will provide Mikron and Quanex prompt notice of any request or requirement;
(B)&nbsp;will provide Mikron and Quanex full and complete cooperation to seek an appropriate order or remedy; (C)&nbsp;will cooperate with Mikron and Quanex in obtaining reliable assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosure of such information and (D)&nbsp;will, if disclosure of such information is required, disclose only that portion of such information which
is legally required to be disclosed. Stockholder shall not be liable for disclosure of such information hereunder under a regulation or to a tribunal compelling such disclosure, if Stockholder has
complied with the notice and cooperation provisions of this paragraph, unless such disclosure to such tribunal is caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by Stockholder not permitted by this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockholder
further agrees that Stockholder will not take with Stockholder or retain, without the prior written authorization of Mikron, any papers, software, source
codes, procedural or technical manuals, customer lists, customer account analyses (including, without limitation, accounts receivable agings, customer payment histories and customer account activity
reports), price books, files or other documents or copies thereof belonging to Mikron or to any affiliate of Mikron, or any materials, supplies, equipment or furnishings belonging to Mikron or to any
affiliate of Mikron, or any other confidential information of any kind belonging to Mikron or any affiliate of Mikron. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AMENDMENT TO LEASE ("Amendment") is made and entered into as of December&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, by and between
the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, a Washington general
partnership ("Landlord") and MIKRON INDUSTRIES,&nbsp;INC., a Washington corporation ("Tenant") with reference to the following facts: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.
Pursuant to that certain lease between Tenant and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Landlord's predecessor in interest)
dated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, as amended (the "Lease"), Tenant leases from Landlord
those certain premises consisting of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the "Existing Premises"), as more particularly described in
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, attached hereto and
by this reference incorporated herein. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the same meanings set forth in the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.
Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the Lease to provide Tenant with an option to extend the term of the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>EXTENSION OPTION.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Tenant shall have the option to extend the term of this Lease for five (5)&nbsp;years ending on
February&nbsp;28, 2015 (the "Extension Term") upon the same terms and conditions (except that the Rental, as provided for in Section&nbsp;3 of the Lease, shall be adjusted pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2 below) contained in the Lease ("Tenant's Option"). Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of its election to exercise Tenant's Option ("Tenant's Notice") no later than
February&nbsp;28, 2009. If Tenant fails to timely give Tenant's Notice, Tenant's Option shall be null and void and of no further force and effect. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>EXTENSION TERM RENT.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The giving of Tenant's Notice by Tenant pursuant to Section&nbsp;1 above shall be sufficient to
make this Lease binding for the Extension Term without further act of the parties, who shall then be bound to take the steps required in the determination of the Rental as specified herein. The Rental
(as provided for in Section&nbsp;3 of the Lease) for each Extension Term shall be the fair market rental value of the Premises upon commencement of the Extension Term. In determining the fair market
rental value of the Premises, consideration shall be given to the then current market rate for similar properties in the general vicinity of the Premises with similar lease provisions. If the parties
do not agree upon the Rental by October&nbsp;31, 2009 (the "Trigger Date"), the Rental shall be determined by arbitration. The parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator within ten
(10)&nbsp;days after the Trigger Date. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within such 10-day period, then either party may seek appointment of an arbitrator by the Chief
Judge of the Superior Court of King County, Washington. Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the arbitrator's appointment, each party shall submit its estimate of the fair market rental value of the
Premises along with any documentary evidence that it may have supporting its estimate. Within fourteen (14)&nbsp;days after the arbitrator's receipt of each party's estimate and evidence, if any,
the arbitrator shall select the estimate that he or she determines is closest to the actual fair market rental value of the Premises. The determination of the estimate that is closest to the actual
fair market value of the Premises by the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The cost of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. In no event shall the fair market rental for
the Premises be less than the Rental due under the Lease during the last month prior to the Extension Term. </FONT></P>
