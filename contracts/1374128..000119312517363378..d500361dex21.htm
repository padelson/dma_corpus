("Parent"), Explorer Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Entellus
Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Defined terms used in
this Agreement have the respective meanings ascribed to them herein.

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, the Company (the
"Company Board") and Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Board") have unanimously
approved and, in the case of the Company Board and the Merger Sub Board,
declared advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
as a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL");

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, subject to _Sections 5.5(d)_ and _5.5(e)_ ,
unanimously resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders approve the
adoption of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
of Parent and certain stockholders of the Company, including certain
directors and officers of the Company who are stockholders of the Company,
have entered into a voting agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit A_
hereto (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
thereof, among other things, the foregoing stockholders agreed to vote the
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by each of them in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger and a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (the "Surviving Corporation"). Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Subject to the provisions of  _Article VI_ ,
the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
(local time) on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, but no later
than the second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date being the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, 155 North Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois.

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall cause an appropriate certificate of merger with respect to the Merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such other date and time as is agreed
between Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and,
as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such
certificate of incorporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action necessary to
change the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to
the name of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be "Entellus Medical,
Inc.", until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 

Section 1.5 _Board of Directors; Officers_. The members of the board of
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the members of the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected, designated or qualified.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_.

 

(a) _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any Securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(i) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or any Subsidiary
of Parent (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares").

 

(ii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, $24.00 per share
in cash, without interest (such amount of cash, the "Merger Consideration").
Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-
entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive,
upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the Merger Consideration.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration
and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Funds_. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall enter into a customary paying agent agreement with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the

 



3  "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for payment in
accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount
necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
shares of Company Common Stock, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ and
to the extent of any such loss, Parent shall fund additional cash amounts to
the Paying Agent to enable payment of such amounts. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(b) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in the form and have such
other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other
customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for cash
in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably
practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Unregistered Transfers_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered is registered, if such 

 



4  Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the funds made available to the
Paying Agent which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or its designee upon demand, and any
such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration. 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority
under applicable Law, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of
their applicable Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any of their applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so
withheld and paid over to an applicable Governmental Authority as required
by applicable Law shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of
their applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent.

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
assume any Company Option or substitute for any Company Option any similar
award for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto,
whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time a
cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the excess,
if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the per share exercise price
of such Company Option, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time

 



5  (the "Option Consideration"), _less_ (ii) any applicable withholding or
other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld. As of
the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price
payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock underlying a Company
Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall
be cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall assume any Company RSU Award or substitute for any Company RSU Award any
similar award for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the Effective Time,
each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU Award be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time
a cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Company RSU Award (the "RSU Consideration"), _less_ (ii) any applicable
withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be
withheld; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU Award
which immediately prior to such cancellation is "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable
settlement date(s) for such Company RSU Award if required in order to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) _Method of Payment_. Any Option Consideration or RSU Consideration to
which an employee or former employee of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries becomes entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 2.3(b)_ shall be paid through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days
after the Closing Date).

 

(d) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof
administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period in
effect as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering
Period shall terminate and each ESPP Option shall be exercised upon the
earlier to occur of (A) an earlier Exercise Date ("New Exercise Date") in
accordance with Section 5.2(c) of the Company ESPP that is no later than four
(4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which
the Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period
shall commence under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii)
no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A)
increase the amount of such participants rate of payroll contributions
thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement or (B)
except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement;
(iii) no individual who is not participating in the Offering Period in effect
as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in such Offering
Period following the

 



6  date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger,
the Company ESPP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Company shall notify each participant in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to any New Exercise Date that the Exercise Date for such
participants ESPP Option (including for purposes of determining the ESPP
Option Price of such ESPP Option) has been changed to the New Exercise Date
and that such participants ESPP Option will be exercised automatically on the
New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn
from the Offering Period.

 

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of any of
the Company Equity Plans, obtain any necessary consents, adopt applicable
resolutions, amend the terms of any of the Company Equity Plans or any
outstanding awards thereunder, and take all other appropriate actions to (i)
give effect to the transactions contemplated herein; (ii) terminate each of
the Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time; and (iii) ensure that after
the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity Award, any
beneficiary thereof nor any other participant in any of the Company Equity
Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any Securities of the Company
or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under any of the Company Equity Plans, except as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_. The Company shall provide Parent with documentation
evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of
such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no later
than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Oxford Warrants_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall assume any Oxford Warrants or
substitute for any Oxford Warrant any similar award for Parent Common Stock
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the Effective Time, each unexercised Oxford Warrant that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Oxford Warrant, no longer be exercisable and shall
have either (i) been exercised by the holder thereof in accordance with
Section 1.6(b)(i) of each Oxford Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) if not so exercised, expired immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide written notice in accordance with Section 1.6(c) of each
Oxford Warrant to the holder thereof (i) that the Merger shall constitute a
"Cash/Public Acquisition" as defined therein and (ii) of the treatment of
such Oxford Warrant pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_, and the Company shall
take all actions required to ensure compliance with the obligations of the
Company under each of the Oxford Warrants in accordance with the terms
thereof to consummate the treatment of the Oxford Warrants pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_. Prior to taking any such actions, including delivery
of the foregoing notice, the Company shall consult with Parent and provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any related notices, filings or other documents.

 

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such

 



7  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying
Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as the Paying Agent or Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
this _Article II_.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock
are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his, her
or its demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal (the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the
"fair value" of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his,
her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring
before, at or after the Effective Time), such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating
to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all discussions, negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to or settle or compromise or
offer to settle or compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery
of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in  _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

Section 2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and directors of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter expressly referenced therein (it being understood and
agreed that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section
and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably
apparent on its face from the text of the disclosure) or (ii) other than with
respect to _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ and _3.5_ , as disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by the Company
on or after December 31, 2016 and at least three (3) Business Days prior to

contained under the heading "Risk Factors" or in any "forward-
looking statements" legend or any similar non-specific, predictive,
precautionary or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly
available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval
System, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized and validly existing under the

operate its properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and
assets are currently operated. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and Amended and Restated
Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), each as amended as of the date of this Agreement, have
been made available to Parent and are in full force and effect, and the
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof. The
organizational or governing documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries

200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 25,478,820 of which were issued
and outstanding and none of which were held by the Company as treasury stock,
and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company, par value
$0.001 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"), no shares of which were
outstanding. There are no other classes of capital stock of the Company and no
bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness or Securities of the Company
having the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for Securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of capital stock of
the Company may vote authorized, issued or outstanding. As of the close
of business on the Capitalization Date, there were (i) outstanding Company
Options to

 



9  purchase 4,238,474 shares of Company Common Stock; (ii) outstanding Company

Company Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the Company Equity

of this Agreement, there have been no issuances of (i) any Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock or any other Securities of the Company other

exercise of any Oxford Warrants outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of such Oxford Warrants or (2) the exercise,
vesting or settlement, as applicable, of any Company Equity Awards outstanding
as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date in accordance with the

Oxford Warrants or the Company ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with
the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are, or
will be when issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.
The Company has made available to Parent or its counsel accurate and complete
copies of each of the Oxford Warrants, the Company ESPP, the Company Equity
Plans and the forms of stock option and restricted stock unit agreements
evidencing the Company Equity Awards, and in respect of the foregoing forms,
other than differences with respect to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock covered thereby, the grant date, the exercise price, regular vesting
schedule and expiration date applicable thereto, no such stock option or
restricted stock unit agreement contains material terms that are not
consistent with, or in addition to, such forms.  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth, as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, each outstanding Company Equity Award and to the extent

Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval
by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof
or other authorized designee) and any required stockholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents. The Company does not have any

exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a share of Company
Common Stock on the applicable Company Option Grant Date, and the Company has
not granted any Company Options that are subject to the provisions of Section
409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Equity Award and the Oxford Warrants
was made in all material respects in accordance with (i) the terms of
the applicable Company Equity Plan, (ii) all applicable securities Laws,
including the NASDAQ Listing Rules, (iii) the Code and (iv) all other
applicable Laws. The Company has the requisite authority under the terms of

the Oxford Warrants described in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and _Section_ __ _
2.4_, respectively, shall, as of the Effective Time, be binding on the
holders of Company Equity Awards and the Oxford Warrants purported to be
covered thereby. All of the outstanding Company Common Stock has been sold
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the federal
securities Laws or an appropriate exemption therefrom. No Subsidiary of the
Company owns any Securities of the Company.

or any of its Subsidiaries is party, in each case pursuant to which any Person

any of its Subsidiaries that have been declared or authorized have been paid
in full.

to) the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this

Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated

 



13  therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company
SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if

registration statement or amendment became effective prior to the date of this
Agreement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

all "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" (as such terms are

there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting, auditing or
revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction
of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief
accounting officer or general counsel of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company Board, any board of directors of any of its
Subsidiaries or any committee of the Company Board or any board of directors
of any of its Subsidiaries.

principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the

on the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the
result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or

and the Applicable Company Subsidiary included therein).

Section 401(a) of the Code has received a recent and currently effective
determination letter or can rely on an opinion letter for a prototype plan
from the Internal Revenue Service that such Pension Plan is so qualified and
exempt from taxation under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, and, to

exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) or breached any fiduciary duties with
respect to any Benefit Plan that reasonably would be expected to subject the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to any material
tax or penalty.

 

(f) With respect to any Benefit Plan, there is no Proceeding pending, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated with or by the
Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Authority, other than routine claims for benefits, in each case,
that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to any material liability.

 



19 (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations
to provide any health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured) to retired
or other former employees, directors or consultants, except as specifically
required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA") or, pursuant to an
applicable employment agreement or severance agreement, plan or policy listed
in _Section_ __ _ 3.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ requiring the
Company or any Subsidiary to pay or subsidize COBRA premiums for a terminated
employee following the employees termination.

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or any termination of employment or service (or other event or
occurrence) in connection therewith will (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any payment or benefit (or result in the funding of any such payment or
benefit) or result in any forgiveness of Indebtedness with respect to any such
persons; (ii) increase the amount of any compensation, equity award or other
benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any
compensation, equity award or other benefits except as required under Section
411(d)(3) of the Code.

(i) No amounts payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(j) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has
used the services or workers provided by third Person contract labor
suppliers, temporary employees, "leased employees" (as that term is defined in
Section 414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have provided services as
independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any of the Benefit Plans or the imposition
of material penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Benefit Plans by the
Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Labor or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and no such individuals are entitled to
any benefits under any Benefit Plan that they have been improperly denied by
reason of their misclassification as independent contractors.

 

(k) With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan: (i) such Foreign Benefit
Plan is in material compliance and has been administered at all times in
material compliance with the applicable provisions of the Laws of such
jurisdiction in which such Benefit Plan is established and the terms of the
applicable Foreign Benefit Plan; (ii) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable material reporting and notice
requirements, and such Foreign Benefit Plan has obtained from the Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Benefit Plan any
required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Benefit Plan is in
material compliance with the Laws of the relevant jurisdiction if such
determinations are required in order to give effect to such Foreign Benefit
Plan; (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending
investigations by any Governmental Authority involving any Foreign Benefit
Plan; and (iv) the consummation of the contemplated transactions will not by
itself create or together with another event result in any material liability
with respect to such Foreign Benefit Plan. If required under applicable laws
to be funded and/or book-reserved, such Foreign Benefit Plan is funded and/or
book-reserved, as appropriate, to the extent 

 



20  so required by applicable Laws. Each Foreign Benefit Plan that is intended
to qualify for tax-preferential treatment under applicable Laws so
qualifies, except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability.

(l) The Company has, for any relevant period, offered the requisite number
of "full-time employees" group health coverage which is "affordable" and of
"minimum value" (as such terms are defined by the employer shared
responsibility provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act).

(ii) as of the date hereof, is in violation of any common law nondisclosure
obligation or fiduciary duty relating to the ability of such individual to
work for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the use of trade secrets
and proprietary information.

 



21 (c) All employees, directors, independent contractors, consultants

inventions.

its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and pay the
Merger Consideration, or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a

quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
(ii) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure the
distribution of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by
Law within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or (iii) if there are insufficient affirmative votes
represented (either in person or by proxy) at the Company Stockholders
Meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that (A) unless agreed to in writing by Parent, (x) any such
adjournment or postponement under the preceding clause (i) or (iii) shall be
for a period of no more than ten (10) Business Days each, and (y) the Company
shall only be permitted to effect up to two (2) such adjournments or
postponements pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) and (iii) (in the

shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders
Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by the preceding clause (i) or
(iii) for a period of up to ten (10) Business Days each ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall only make up to two (2) such requests, and no
such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a
change in the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting). If the
Company Board has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_, the Company shall, through the
Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of

obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal).

 



51 (c) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in

Section 5.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties
hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause
the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to
avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and any
other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, upon a date to be mutually
agreed upon by the parties hereto (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, unless agreed otherwise by the
parties hereto), make its respective filings under the HSR Act, and thereafter
make any other applications and filings as reasonably determined by the
Company and Parent under other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than as required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to, and without the prior written consent of Parent, none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will, grant or offer
to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any
payment, to any third Person in connection with seeking or obtaining its
consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood that this sentence does not apply to the actions required by
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_).

(b) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
investigation or other inquiry from a Governmental Authority or in connection
with any

 



52  Proceeding initiated by a private party, in each case, under any applicable
Antitrust Laws, including (i) promptly informing the other party of such
inquiry or Proceeding, (ii) consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or in connection
with any such Proceeding, to any other Person, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either party and any Governmental Authority, or in connection with any such
Proceeding, between either party and any other Person with respect to this
Agreement and (iii) providing the other party with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon and consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with all written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals)
between either party and any Governmental Authority, or in connection with
any such Proceeding, between either party and any other Person with respect to
this Agreement. In addition, each of the parties hereto will give reasonable
notice to and consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority, or in connection with any such Proceeding,
with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental
Authority, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or conference.

(c) The parties shall consult with each other with respect to obtaining
all permits and Consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth below in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_,
Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries),
any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including by its
Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than the Termination Date, including,
without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Company, (y) creating, terminating, or
divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company and (z) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would
limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the Company, in each case as may be required in
order to obtain all expirations or terminations of waiting periods required
under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the commencement of any action by a
Governmental Authority to prohibit the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement under any Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the
Termination Date. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth
in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, the Company shall enter into one or more
agreements requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the
Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise
take any action that limits the Companys freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the 

 



53  Company (each, a "Divestiture Action"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
consummation of the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a
Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of
all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will occur
immediately following such Divestiture Action (and where Parent has
irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately following such
Divestiture Action).

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any Divestiture
Action or otherwise agree to or proffer to sell, divest, hold separate, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair or take any
other action with respect to Parents or any of its Affiliates ability to
own or operate any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, any assets, properties, businesses or
product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to
take any action contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ or this _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ in connection with any Proceeding by a Person other than a
Governmental Authority, and the Company shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, unless requested to do so by Parent, commit
to or effect any action contemplated in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ or this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_.

 

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Merger Sub, and their
respective Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice, to all of the officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, contracts and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided herein, the Company may restrict or prohibit such access to
such documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law
requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such access,
(b) granting such access would violate any Contract or material obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a third Person with respect to
confidentiality or otherwise breach, contravene or violate, constitute a
default under, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate any
obligations under, any then-effective Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or (c) access to such documents or information
would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege in respect
of such documents or information, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law,
Contract or material obligation or waive such privilege or work-product
doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will hold any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 



54 Section 5.5 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _
5.5(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_, (i) the Company shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
all existing activities, discussions, negotiations and communications, if any,
with any Persons (or any of their Representatives) with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (ii) the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (A)
initiate, seek, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage, or induce or take
any other action designed or intended to lead to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions with, or furnish or
cause to be furnished any information or data to, or furnish access to the
Companys (or any of its Subsidiaries) properties with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Person (other than Parent or any
of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal reasonably expected to lead to any Company
Acquisition Proposal, or grant any waiver or release under (or terminate,
amend or modify any provision of), or fail to enforce to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any confidentiality or standstill or similar
agreement (except that if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
grant any waiver or release would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such
standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third Person
to make a Company Acquisition Proposal), (C) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement
or understanding relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (D) submit to
the stockholders of the Company for their approval any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or (E) resolve to do, or agree or announce an intention to do, any
of the foregoing; (iii) the Company shall not provide (and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to not provide)
and shall promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of the
date of this Agreement, terminate access of any third Person (and its
Representatives) to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any of the
Companys (or any Subsidiary of the Companys) confidential information
granted in connection with, or with the intent of obtaining, any possible
Company Acquisition Proposal; and (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause any such third Person (and its
Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or its or its Subsidiaries businesses or
operations) to return or destroy all such information, and in connection
therewith the Company shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of the date of
this Agreement, demand the return or destruction of all confidential
information and materials provided to any third Persons (or their
Representatives) relating to a possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ by any of the Companys or the Companys Subsidiaries
Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and
whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company, a Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by the Company.

 



55 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations in  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company receives, after the date hereof, a bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal from a third Person that did not result from a breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, then the Company may (i) furnish information
concerning its business, properties or assets to such Person pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to
Parent promptly after execution) and (ii) negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning such Company
Acquisition Proposal, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), if and only if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x) such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
The Company (A) shall promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide Parent notice (1) of the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall include a complete, unredacted copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, and (2) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received
by, any requests for information from, or any discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal or proposal that is reasonably likely to constitute or
lead to or result in a Company Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the identity
of the other party (or parties) and the terms (including any amendments
thereto) of such inquiry, offer, proposal, request, discussion or negotiation
and, in the case of written materials, provide copies of such materials, (B)
shall substantially concurrently (and in any case within twenty-four (24)
hours) make available to Parent all information, including copies of
all written materials, provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
its or its Subsidiaries Representatives to such party but not previously made
available to Parent and (C) shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt
basis (and, in any case, within twenty-four (24) hours of any significant
development, discussions or negotiations) of the status and details (including
amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal
or other inquiry, offer, proposal, request, discussion or negotiation (which
shall include copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments
thereon) of agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to
any Company Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives in each case
thereof, on the one hand, and the Person (or any of its Representatives)
making such Company Acquisition Proposal, on the other hand).

(c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 5.5(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose
to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, authorize, declare advisable, endorse or
recommend (or publicly propose to approve, authorize, declare advisable,
endorse or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iii) adopt or approve, or propose to adopt
or approve, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding in
connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement permitted under, and in compliance with _Section_
__ _ 5.5(b)_).

 



56 (d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or Company Board receives a Company
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.5_, the Company Board may authorize and cause the Company to (x) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ and concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal
(subject to the satisfaction of its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_)
if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement; (iii)
the Company has provided Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreements
(and any related agreements) among the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and
the Person making such Company Superior Proposal (and the identity of the
Person making such Company Superior Proposal); (iv) for a period of four (4)
Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_, the Company and its Representatives shall have
discussed and negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any
material term or condition of any Company Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and a new four (4) Business Day negotiation period); and (v) no
earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), after considering and taking into account
the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement made by
Parent in writing, that (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the notice described in clause (ii) above still constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall
be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ and shall not be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may, in response to a Company Intervening Event, effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that it intends to effect such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_ (which notice
shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Company
Intervening Event and for the Company Boards determination to effect the
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in detail); (iii) for a period of four
(4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_, the Company and its Representatives shall have
discussed and negotiated with Parent in good faith any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new four (4)
Business Day negotiation period); and (iv) no earlier than the end of such
negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation

 



57  with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel), after
considering and taking into account the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement made by Parent in writing, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ affect the obligations specified in _Section_ __ _
5.5(d)_ or _5.5(e)_ (or to the consequences thereof in accordance with this
Agreement) or the definition of Company Adverse Recommendation Change herein
and (B) any such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that does not expressly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the text of any disclosure
proposed to be made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ at the earliest
practicable time in advance of such disclosure.

Section 5.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers of the Company (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and
the Company (in each case, as in effect on, and, in the case of any
indemnification Contracts, to the extent made available to Parent prior to,
the date of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
solely with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made
for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after the
Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of 

 



58  liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If the Company or
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably
be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ not to
be satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time; (b) any notice or other communication from any third Person alleging
that the consent of such third Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(c) any material regulatory notice, report or results of inspection from the
FDA or any similar Governmental Authority. Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be
expected to cause any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ not to be
satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time;
and (ii) any notice or other communication from any third Person alleging
that the consent of such third Person is or may be required in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or

 



59  agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto hereunder. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made
by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company shall mutually
agree on the initial press release or releases with respect to the execution
of this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue
any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), except as such press release or other announcement may be required
by Law or the rules of a national securities exchange or trading market on
which such partys Securities are listed, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to

shall not apply to any press release or other announcement (i) made by the
Company with respect to or in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change effected by the Company Board in accordance with this Agreement or (ii)
made by the Company or Parent concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a determination by
the Company or the Company Board in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to constitute, a Company Superior Proposal or any
dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of the preceding clause (i) or (ii), to the extent not prohibited by

Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
earlier of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time and (y) the date on which the employment of an employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who continues his or her employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") terminates, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall provide each
Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base salary, at least equal to the
annual base salary, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus or incentive opportunities that are no
less favorable than the cash bonus or incentive opportunities provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates, and (iii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable (in the aggregate) to the employee
benefits (including severance benefits but excluding for such purposes any
equity or equity-related awards, and any defined benefit pension benefits)
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.

 



60 (b) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, as of the
Effective Time, receive full credit for service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual under the employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee becomes a
participant (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
defined benefit pension plan); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein
shall result in the duplication of any benefits for the same period of
service. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates for
the benefit of Continuing Employees (including any medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans), Parent shall (i) cause to be waived
any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements
or required physical examinations, actively-at-work requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the
extent such were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare
benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid (or otherwise deemed paid)
by such Continuing Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for the plan year
that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parents obligations under this clause (ii) shall be subject
to its receipt of all necessary information, from either the Company or such
Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by such Continuing Employee.

 

(c) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take, or shall
cause the Applicable Company Subsidiary to take, all necessary actions to
cause the participation by the Applicable Company Subsidiary and its employees
in the 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by any professional employer
organization to terminate and cease effective prior to the Closing (the "ACS
401(k) Plan"). The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such actions
have been taken by the appropriate authority. The form and substance of any
such actions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The
Company will make (or cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the
contributions (i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status
of the ACS 401(k) Plan; and (ii) for elective deferrals and Company matching
contributions required to be made pursuant to the ACS 401(k) Plan for the
period prior to termination. Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in
the ACS 401(k) Plan will be allowed to participate, effective as of the
Effective Time, in a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code
that is sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (the "Parent 401(k)
Plan"). Parent will, or will cause an Affiliate to, take all actions necessary
so that the Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code, inclusive of loans to the extent administratively practicable) from
the ACS 401(k) Plan and Parent (or its Affiliate) will thereafter maintain
such loan under the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 



61 (d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing
herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to
continue any Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; or (iii) amend any Benefit Plans or other employee benefit
plans or arrangements.

 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Benefit
Plan, immediately prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay each Continuing Employee any and all accrued and unused
vacation and paid-time off as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,

days of PTO for use during the remainder of the calendar year in which the

resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent an executed copy of a
customary payoff letter from the agents under the Existing Credit Agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent relating to the
repayment in full of all obligations thereunder or secured thereby, the
termination of all commitments in connection therewith and the release of all
Liens securing the obligations thereunder (the "Payoff Letter"). The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver to Parent (or the agent
under the Existing Credit Agreement, in the case of prepayment and termination
notices) prior to the Closing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, all the documents, filings and notices required for the termination
of commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement and the release of all
Liens securing the obligations thereunder, including the filing of UCC
releases, termination of control agreements, and delivery of possessory
collateral, which shall in each case be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and the repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding under
the Existing Credit Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall pay or shall
cause to be paid, in full and in immediately available funds, any and all
amounts outstanding and then due and payable under the Existing Credit
Agreement in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

 



62 Section 5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable

rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of the
shares of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common
Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.
The Company shall not cause the Company Common Stock to be delisted from
NASDAQ prior to the Effective Time. If the Surviving Corporation is required
to file any quarterly or annual report by a filing deadline that is imposed
by the Exchange Act which falls on a date within the ten (10) days following
the Closing Date, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver
to Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing a
substantially final draft of any such annual or quarterly report reasonably
likely to be required to be filed during such period.

 

Section 5.14 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute becomes
or is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Merger, the Voting
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company Board shall take any and all actions necessary to render such statutes
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

Section 5.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
notice as soon as possible of, and the opportunity to participate in (subject
to a customary joint defense agreement), but not control, the defense or
settlement of, any litigation against the Company and/or its directors or

Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether

any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against
the Company or any of its directors or executive officers relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction

notice thereof shall be given by the terminating party to the other party,
specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect

subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any material and
intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud, in which case, the aggrieved
party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity; and
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement, this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and _Article VIII_ shall survive

Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) (A) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ on the basis of a
breach of a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (B) either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(iii)_ and in any such termination under clauses (A) or (B), (1) prior
to such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
disclosed and not publicly withdrawn at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting in the case of termination pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_ or is otherwise known to the Company Board and
not withdrawn (publicly, if publicly disclosed) in the case of termination
pursuant to either _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_,
and (2) within twelve (12) months after any such termination under clauses (A)
or (B), any Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
(regardless of when or whether such transaction is consummated) ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(i)_, the
references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)");

 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_;

 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

 

Any payments required to be made under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ shall be
made by wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated
by Parent, (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the same day as the earlier
of any consummation of, or entry into a definitive agreement with respect to,
the transaction contemplated therein, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above,
immediately prior to or simultaneously with such termination and (z) in the
case of clause (iii) above, promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay
Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, experts and consultants incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount not to exceed $6,600,000 (the "Parent Expenses");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any payment of the Parent Expenses shall not
affect Parents right to receive any Company Termination Fee otherwise due
under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, but shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, any Company Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_.

 



68 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(d) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the
Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such suit
(including reasonable attorneys fees), together with interest on such amount
at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 

(e) The payment, when due and paid, by the Company to Parent of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ and, to the extent
applicable, any amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in the event of the
termination of this Agreement under the circumstances requiring the payment
of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event Parent actually receives the Company
Termination Fee (and, to the extent applicable, any amounts payable under
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_), the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or
Merger Sub that Parent or Merger Sub may be otherwise entitled to pursue
under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, and in such case neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding or make any claim
against the Company or any of its Representatives arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as
set forth in the last proviso of the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company Termination Fee

Section 8.4 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 

(a) The parties hereto have participated collectively in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted collectively by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

(b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and

 



71  schedules are to the articles, sections and paragraphs of, and exhibits,
annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and the
table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without
limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be deemed to include
the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall be deemed to
include all genders, words denoting natural persons shall be deemed to
include business entities and vice versa, and references to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or
phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to December 7, 2017,
unless the context requires otherwise. References to any information or
document being "made available" or "furnished" and words of similar import

throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, and
all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. For the purposes of this Agreement, to the extent
any provision of this Agreement refers to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
or otherwise to any Subsidiary of the Company, such references shall include

period. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.

Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that any

 



72  Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Parent, or a combination thereof, so long as such assignment would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect and no such assignment shall release Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, from its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.6_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Voting
Agreement(s), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter,
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is
specifically intended that (a) the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ from and after the
Effective Time) are intended third-party beneficiaries hereof and (b) from and
after the Effective Time, the holders of other Company Common Stock and
Company Equity Awards are intended third-party beneficiaries of _Article II_.

 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware.

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that any party hereto does not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



73 Section 8.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in such courts and (iv) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and
nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
claim or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect hereof brought by any other party hereto made by mailing
copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, and such service of process shall be sufficient to
confer personal jurisdiction over such party in such claim or Proceeding and
shall otherwise constitute effective and binding service in every respect.

 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
BETWEEN ANY OF THEM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
