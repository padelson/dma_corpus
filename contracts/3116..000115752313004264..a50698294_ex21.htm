WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser, and the
Company have determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests
of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition, it is proposed that Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in such merger (the "Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are in the best interests of their respective
stockholders;

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting
Agreement (a "Voting Agreement") in connection with the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to
its stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants, and other terms contained in this Agreement, the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the Merger shall be effected and Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (as such, the "Surviving

Section 1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article
VIII, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the later of (i) the second Business
Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions, and (ii) the earlier of (A) a date during the Marketing Period to
be specified by Parent on no fewer than three Business Days' notice to the
Company and (B) the third Business Day following the final day of the

conditions set forth in Article VII as of the date determined pursuant to this
Section 1.2, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be

to be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a certificate of merger
and any other appropriate documents, executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL and other Applicable Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing, acceptance and
effectiveness of the certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State, or at such later time as is mutually agreed by the parties and set
forth therein (the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth

Time, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended as
a result of the Merger so as to read in its entirety as the certificate of
incorporation of Purchaser except that Article I thereof shall be amended to
properly reflect the name of the Surviving Corporation and with such
modifications as may be required by Section 6.10 and, as so amended, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and Applicable
Law and (ii) the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended as a result of the
Merger so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Purchaser and with
such modifications as may be required by Section 6.10 and, as so amended,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 1.6 Directors; Officers. From and after the Effective Time, (i) the
directors of the Purchaser shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their

shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
be deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive $43.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder
thereof, without any interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes,
upon surrender and exchange of a Certificate (defined below). All Shares that
have been so converted shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with
respect to the Shares formerly evidenced thereby except for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and until surrendered to the Paying Agent as set forth below, each
Certificate shall represent for all purposes with respect to each Share
formerly evidenced thereby only such right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of Shares or a different class by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, or exchange of Shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, or exchange of Shares.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to
the extent required by the DGCL, Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such
Shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto (the
"Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and, at the
Effective Time be cancelled and cease to exist, and holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after
the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws
or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2.1(d), if the Merger is not consummated then the right of any
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company will give Parent
(x) notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals and (y) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisals or compromise, or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.2 Company Stock Plans.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company's Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary, including obtaining the consent of the
individual holders, to provide for the cancellation, effective at the
Effective Time, of all the outstanding options, restricted stock grants,
restricted stock subject to vesting or similar rights to purchase or acquire
Shares ("Stock Rights"), whether or not vested, heretofore granted under any
stock option or similar plan of the Company or other agreement or arrangement
(the "Stock Plans"), without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided
for herein. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
accelerate the vesting of all unvested Stock Rights and each then vested Stock
Right shall thereafter no longer be exercisable but shall entitle each holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to a payment in cash by the
Company, at the Effective Time, equal to the Merger Consideration, less the
applicable exercise price of such Stock Right, if any (the "Stock Rights
Payment"). Any payment made hereunder shall be subject to all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding requirements and to the
extent that amounts are withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Stock
Right. Within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company an amount necessary to make
payment of the aggregate amounts of Merger Consideration due to holders of
Stock Rights pursuant to this Section 2.2, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall make payments to holders of Stock Rights as set forth
herein.

  

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Stock Plans shall terminate and all rights
under any provision of any other plan, program, or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company or any Subsidiary shall be cancelled. At and after the Effective
Time, no Person shall have any right under the Stock Rights, the Stock Plans,
or any other plan, program, or arrangement with respect to equity securities
of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, except the right to
receive the Stock Rights Payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.3 Payment for Shares.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with or for the account of a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon the conversion of Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) (the "Payment Fund"). For purposes of determining the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be made available, Parent shall assume that
there will be no Dissenting Shares. If for any reason the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Shares are entitled pursuant
to this Section 2.3, Parent shall be liable for the payment thereof. The
expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event, no later than the second Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent, Purchaser, or any other
Subsidiary of Parent) of a certificate or certificates that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, evidenced outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), (i)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate and (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on any cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or established to
the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

  

  

(c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this Agreement; provided that the Person to whom the Merger Consideration is
paid shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the
Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise
indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates.

  

  

(e) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, in
(i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements, or bankers' acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10,000,000,000.00. Any net earnings with respect to the
Payment Fund shall be the property of and paid over to Parent as and when
requested by Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates that have not
theretofore complied with the terms hereof shall thereafter look only to
Parent, and only as general creditors thereof, for payment of their claim for
any Merger Consideration.

  

  

(g) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any payments or distributions
payable from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law.

  

  

(h) Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to
be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Stock Rights, or Certificates such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

  

  

(i) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration on the records of the
Company of transfers of any shares of capital stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
Certificate (other than representing Shares described in Section 2.1(b)) is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) In the case of any outstanding Shares that are uncertificated, the parties
shall make such adjustments to this Section 2.3 as are necessary or
appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.3 has
with respect to Shares that are represented by Certificates.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except to the extent disclosed (i) in the Company's SEC Documents (defined
below) filed with the SEC since April 30, 2012 and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set
forth in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to
forward-looking statements and any other disclosures included in such SEC
Documents to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature), or
(ii) under the corresponding section in the letter dated the date of this
Agreement from the Company to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (it
being understood that any information set forth in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to qualify the representation and warranty
set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other
representation and warranty set forth in this Article III to the extent that
it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant to
such other representation and warranty), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

  

  

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to the Company means
any event, change, circumstance, effect or state of facts that (i) has, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, assets, or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than those arising out of (1)
general economic conditions, (2) conditions generally affecting industries in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operates, (3) the financial markets, (4)
the entering into, the public announcement or disclosure or the pendency of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than for
purposes of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.3), the
taking of any action explicitly required by this Agreement or at the written
request of, or with the written consent of, Parent or Purchaser or the
identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to, Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates, including the impact of any of the
foregoing on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with other Persons, including Governmental
Authorities, customers, suppliers, officer or employees, (5) any litigation
brought or threatened by stockholders of the Company (whether on behalf of the
Company or otherwise) in respect of the announcement of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby),
(6) any act of God or any natural disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage,
military action or war (whether or not declared) or any escalation or
worsening thereof, (7) any change in political or social conditions, (8) any
change or proposed change in Applicable Law (as defined herein) or
interpretations thereof, (9) any change in GAAP (or authoritative
interpretations thereof), (10) any failure by the Company to meet analysts'
revenue or earning projections or any change in or failure by the Company to
meet its internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or
other financial performance or results of operations (it being understood that
the exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any event, change, circumstance, effect or state of facts
underlying such failure has, or would reasonably be expected to have, resulted
in a Material Adverse Effect), (11) any change in the price or trading volume
of the Common Stock (it being understood that the exception in this clause
shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any event, change,
circumstance, effect or state of facts underlying such failure has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, resulted in a Material Adverse Effect), or
(12) except as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in Section 3.22, the
determination by, or the delay of a determination by, the US Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") or any other Governmental Authority, or any panel or
advisory body empowered or appointed thereby, in each case, after the date of
this Agreement, with respect to the approval or non-approval of any products
(except with respect to any supply interruption, discontinuance or product
recall of any products that are currently being marketed or commercialized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), new methods of delivery for existing
products or new dosages for existing products, in each case of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; provided that the events, changes, circumstances, effects or
state of facts set forth in the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7)
and (8) may be taken into account in determining whether a "Material Adverse
Effect" has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur, in each case to
the extent, and only to the extent, that such events, changes, circumstances,
effects or state of facts have a disproportionate adverse impact on the
Company Parties and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other
companies operating in the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries
operate, or (ii) prevents, materially impedes or materially delays, or would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
Company's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company,
in each case as amended to date, each of which is in full force and effect.

  

  

(c) Exhibit 21.1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2013 sets forth a true, correct, and complete list of all
subsidiaries of the Company required to be so reported (each a "Subsidiary"
and collectively "Subsidiaries"). Except as set forth in such Exhibit 21.1,
all Subsidiaries of the Company are wholly owned directly or indirectly by the
Company.

  

  

Section 3.2 Corporate Authorization. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized, and this Agreement has been
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no other corporate
proceeding on the part of the Company, other than the approval of the
Company's stockholders described in Section 3.18, is necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the
date hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly
adopted at a meeting duly called and held, which resolutions have not been
rescinded, modified or withdrawn as of the time of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, by unanimous vote of those directors present and voting (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and has
resolved, subject to Section 6.7, to recommend adoption of this Agreement to
the holders of Shares (the "Company Board Recommendation"), and (ii) directed
that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption
at a stockholders' meeting duly called and held for such purpose. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company
or the comparable governing documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, in
each case as amended to date, (ii) subject to the governmental filings and

breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,

acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result
(or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
result) in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any indenture, credit agreement,
or other agreement, contract, lease, note, permit, concession, franchise,
license, or other instrument or undertaking (each, a "Contract") to which the

of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets is bound or affected, or
(iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.3(b), conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, statute,
ordinance, guideline, code, order, ruling, judgment, injunction,
pronouncement, decree or other legally enforceable requirement (including
common law) of any Governmental Authority ("Applicable Law"), except, in the
case of clauses (ii) or (iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches,
defaults, violations, rights, losses or Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or materially delay or impair consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration,
registration or filing with, or notice to, any nation or government or

(c) Except as described above, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries has or

to or bound by, any outstanding Stock Right, warrant, call, subscription or
other right (including any preemptive or similar right and whether or not

Section 3.5 SEC Documents.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed or furnished on a timely basis all required reports,
schedules, forms, statements, and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated therein) with the SEC on or after April 30,
2011 (such reports, schedules, forms, statements, and other documents being
hereinafter referred to as the "SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates,
the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange
Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC
Documents, and none of the SEC Documents as of such dates contained any untrue
statements of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent amended or superseded by a later filing prior to the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved
written comments received from the SEC with respect to any of the SEC
Documents.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the SEC Documents (the "Financial
Statements") comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
otherwise be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-
end audit adjustments).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the SEC Documents is recorded and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of the SEC Documents. The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since April 30, 2011, the Company has disclosed to the
Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design

(c) With respect to the Company Plans, except to the extent that the

loss of such qualified status of such Company Plan;

  

  

(iii) there is no Claim (which includes any investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding) by the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit

rise to any such Claims;

liability for severance pay, unemployment compensation, termination pay or
withdrawal liability, or accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer,
director, stockholder or other service provider of the Company or its

Section 4.4 Certain Information. None of the information provided by Parent or
Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in, or which may be
deemed to be incorporated by reference in, the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto, will, at the time the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or published, sent or
given to the Company's stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a

other than in connection with its organization, the negotiation and execution

Section 4.7 Sufficient Funds; Financing.

  

  

(a) Without limiting the effect of Section 9.13(b), as of the Closing Date,
Parent shall have, or have immediately available to it, sufficient funds
necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Stock
Rights Payment and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of fees and expenses that are for its
account.

  

  

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and correct copy of the fully
executed debt commitment letter pursuant to which the financial institutions
party thereto (together with any Person that signs a joinder to the Commitment
Letter or otherwise provides or agrees to provide a portion of the Financing
or any financial institution that becomes party to any Financing Document, the
"Financing Sources") have committed to provide debt financing to Parent and/or
Purchaser (the "Financing") (such commitment letter, including all exhibits,
schedules and annexes thereto and a customarily redacted fee letter,
collectively, the "Commitment Letter"). As of the date of this Agreement, the
commitments represented by the Commitment Letter are in full force and effect
and constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (subject to the conditions
therein). The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the
date of this Agreement and the respective commitments contained therein have
not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Sources has
notified Parent of its intention to terminate the Commitment Letter or not to
provide the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in
default or breach under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter and no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach by Parent under any term or condition of the
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to
believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any of the conditions to the Financing to be satisfied pursuant
to the Commitment Letter on the Closing Date. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side Contracts relating to the Financing to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that impose conditions to the
funding of the Financing, other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter.
True and complete copies of any fee letters or engagement letters that include
"market flex" or other provisions affecting the terms or conditions of the
Financing have been provided to the Company, with only the fee amounts and
certain other terms (none of which would reduce the aggregate amount or affect
the conditionality of the Financing) redacted. Except as otherwise set forth
in or expressly contemplated by the Commitment Letter and except for the
payment of customary fees, there are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing.

Section 4.8 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, or other
Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's, or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.9 DGCL Section 203. Neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of their
"affiliates or associates" has been an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, as those terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, within the
prior three (3) years. As of the date hereof and at all times prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of their Affiliates,
beneficially owns (within the meaning of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder) any shares of Common Stock.

  

  

Section 4.10 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE IV or in the certificate
referenced in Section 7.2(c), neither Parent nor Purchaser makes any express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent, Purchaser or any
of their Affiliates or with respect to any other information provided, or made
available, to the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Purchaser
disclaim any and all other representations and warranties other than those
contained in this ARTICLE IV and in the certificate referenced in Section
7.2(c), whether express or implied.

practicable prepare and file (and in any event within 20 (twenty) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement) with the SEC a proxy statement or
information statement (together with any supplement or amendment thereto, the
"Proxy Statement") relating to the Stockholders Meeting in accordance and in
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included in the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of

information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of the Company's officers, employees, legal
advisors or agents, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other

respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, or to
participate in any meeting (telephonic or otherwise) with the SEC. The Company
shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed reasonably promptly
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

  

  

Section 6.2 Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, upon reasonable notice, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall afford

offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent with such financial,
operating, correspondence with the FDA and other data and information as
Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at Parent's expense, during
normal business hours, under the supervision of the Company's personnel, and
in such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required
to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such
disclosure would, in the Company's reasonable good faith judgment, (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii) contravene
any Applicable Laws, fiduciary duty, or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date hereof; and in any such event, the parties hereto will seek to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance, or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
of which it is aware that will, or is reasonably likely to, result in (a) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (b) any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations and
warranties of any of the parties or the conditions to the performance by the
parties hereunder.

the confidentiality agreement, dated June 20, 2013, by and between Parent and
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") remains in full force and effect
and shall survive the execution and, if any, termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any information
provided pursuant to Section 6.7 shall constitute confidential information
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that nothing contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall limit the rights of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.7.

  

  

Section 6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of the respective conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.6 Public Announcements. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, will consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release,
file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K, or make such public statement
as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the rules and
regulations of the SEC or any applicable securities exchange, if such party
has first used reasonable efforts to consult with the other party. The parties
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the

Confidentiality Agreement may permit the submission of Acquisition Proposals
to the Company's Board of Directors on a private and confidential basis.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.7, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease any encouragement, solicitation, discussion or negotiation
with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal and shall request that any
such Person promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.7, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its

not to (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage the making of
an Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts
that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), (ii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or
discussions concerning, or furnish to any Person any non-public information in
connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating,
an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of
the existence of this Section 6.7, (iii) enter into any letter of intent,
acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.7(b) to the contrary, but subject to
the last sentence of this Section 6.7(c), if at any time after the date of
this Agreement and until such time as the stockholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, which did not result from any breach of this Section 6.7, the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall be
permitted to (i) furnish, pursuant to (and only pursuant to) an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, information with respect to the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made the Acquisition Proposal; provided
that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is provided to any Person given such access and that was not previously
provided to Parent, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, in each case only if the Company's Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to lead to or constitute a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent if any
inquiries, proposals, or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by the Company or any of its Representatives and provide Parent with
a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal received (including any written
agreements, arrangements, understandings, forms of agreements supplied to
third parties, and any applicable financial statements and evidence of any
planned financing with respect to the Acquisition Proposal) and a written
statement with respect to any non-written Acquisition Proposal received, which
statement shall include the identity of the parties making the Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms thereof. The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and content of any
discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal with a third party. The Company
agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
Section 6.7 or otherwise prohibit the Company from complying with its
obligations under this Section 6.7.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Neither the Company's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt
or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal Documentation (or
in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D
under the Exchange Act, fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer); (B) withhold or
withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or
publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation; or (C) fail
to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, subject to
the immediately following sentence;(any action described in this clause
Section 6.7(d)(i) being referred to as a "Change of Recommendation," it being
understood that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company's Board
of Directors to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation) or (ii) authorize or execute (or cause or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is intended to or would

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to Section 6.7(c)) (any such
documentation, "Acquisition Proposal Documentation").

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the required stockholder
approval for the Merger, the Company's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof may:

  

  

(i) if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 6.7) that has not been
withdrawn and that the Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (A) effect a Change of Recommendation or (B) terminate this
Agreement to execute Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to such
Superior Proposal if and only if in the case of clause (A) or (B): (1) the
Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law; (2) the Company
then provides written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") that
the Company intends to take such action and describing the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for such action,
including with such Notice of Superior Proposal a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction document(s) related to the Superior Proposal (including
the identity of the Person making the proposal); (3) during the four (4)
Business Day period following Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
and other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (4) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the
Company's Board of Directors shall then have determined in good faith, taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent to the Company in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(i) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under Applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.7(e)(i); provided, that
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed
references to a two (2) Business Day period; and

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company's
Board of Directors or any committee thereof may effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, if and only if: (A) the
Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law; (B) the Company
then provides written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Intervening Event") that
the Company intends to take such action and describing the Intervening Event
that is the basis for such action in reasonable detail; (C) during the four
(4) Business Day period following Parent's receipt of the Notice of
Intervening Event, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors and other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Intervening Event would no longer
necessitate a Change of Recommendation; and (D) following the end of such four
(4) Business Day period, the Company's Board of Directors shall then have
determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent to the Company in response to the
Notice of Intervening Event or otherwise, that the failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law.
Any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 6.7(e)(ii); provided, that references to the four (4) Business Day
period above shall be deemed references to a two (2) Business Day period.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide
offer or proposal (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person (other
than Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliates thereof) relating to, or that is
reasonably expected to lead to, (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, or other business combination involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the acquisition or purchase of more
than 20% of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) any tender offer (including self-tenders) or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning more
than 20% of any class of equity securities of the Company, or (iv) the
acquisition or purchase (including by way of license) of more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of the Company or assets to which 20% or more of the
Company's revenues, net income or earnings before interest expense, taxes,
depreciation and amortization on a consolidated basis are attributable, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal not arising out of a breach of Section 6.7 to acquire directly or
indirectly more than 50% of the Shares then outstanding or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company that the Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, and
other aspects of the proposal, and the Person making such proposal, would, if
consummated, be more favorable to the Company's stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the Merger (in each case, taking into account any
revisions to this Agreement made or proposed by Parent). For purposes of this
Agreement, an "Intervening Event" means a material event, development or
change in circumstances with respect to the Company occurring, arising or
coming to the attention of the Company's Board of Directors after the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the required stockholder approval for
the Merger, and which was not known, and could not reasonably be expected to
have been known or foreseen, to or by the Company's Board of Directors as of
or prior to the date of this Agreement and was not known by the Company's
executive officers or reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall (1) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal, (2) any events, developments or
change in circumstances of Parent, (3) clearance of the Merger under the HSR
Act, (4) any pronouncements, approvals, issuances or regulations of the FDA or
other Healthcare Regulatory Authority (5) any events, developments or change
in circumstances relating to any products of any competitors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (6) any matter relating to the foregoing or
consequence of the foregoing, constitute an Intervening Event.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company, the Company's Board of Directors from taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any disclosure required by Applicable Law;
provided that making such disclosure under this Section 6.7(g) shall not in
any way limit or modify the effect, if any, that any such action has under
this Section 6.7.

  

  

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative of
the Company takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute
a breach of this Section 6.7, the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of
this Section 6.7.

  

  

Section 6.8 Consents; Approvals and Filings. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall (a) use reasonable best
efforts to make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the Exchange Act and any other Applicable Law,
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(b) subject to Section 6.13, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications, and orders of Governmental Entities
and cooperate to obtain all consents, approvals, and authorizations of parties
to contracts with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as are necessary for
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such
action. Immediately following execution of this Agreement by the parties
hereto, Parent shall act by written consent to approve this Agreement as sole
stockholder of Purchaser.

Section 6.9 Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees (the
"Affected Employees") of the Company and its Subsidiaries, for a period of one
(1) year following the Effective Time, compensation and employee benefits
(other than any equity based compensation, defined benefit plan benefits or
retiree medical benefits) that in the aggregate are at least comparable to
those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Affected
Employees under the Company Plans, and Parent shall cause to be provided to
any Affected Employee who is terminated during such one-year period following
the Effective Time severance benefits comparable or superior to those
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated
employees under any Company Plan set forth on Section 6.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
unused vacation, holiday, sickness, and personal days accrued by the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the policies and practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent such accruals are reflected in the
Financial Statements. In the event of any change in the welfare benefits
provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Company Plan during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Affected Employees and their covered dependents
under such plan (except to the extent that such conditions, exclusions, or
waiting periods would apply under the Company Plans) and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in coverage in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such
new or changed plan. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide each Affected Employee with credit for all service with the
Company and its Affiliates for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and with respect to determining benefit under any
vacation or severance policy, under each employee benefit plan, policy,
program, or arrangement (other than any equity based plan or defined benefit
plan) in which such Affected Employee is eligible to participate, to the same
extent such service was recognized under a corresponding Company Plan as of
the Effective Time or except to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of services.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The parties hereto agree that nothing herein expressed or implied (i) is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations
or liabilities under or by reason of this Section 6.9, (ii) shall create any
right to continued employment with the Parent, Company, Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary, (iii) shall interfere with Parent's right to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
agreement or to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any reason (or no reason) after the Effective Time, or (iv)
shall be construed to establish or amend any Company Plan, or benefit plan,
policy or arrangement of the Parent, its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 6.10 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against any and all
losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees, costs, and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending the foregoing and including
any liabilities, fees, costs or other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
enforcing rights under this Agreement) arising out of or related to any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation based
on, arising out of or related to, in whole or in part, any action or omission
taken or foregone in such DandO Indemnified Party's position as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (the "DandO Indemnified
Liabilities"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent
permitted under Applicable Law (and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party;
provided, that in connection with any such advancement of expenses, the
applicable DandO Indemnified Party shall execute an undertaking to repay to the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries any amount for which it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified
Party would not have been entitled to indemnification under applicable law or
the provisions of this Agreement). Subject to and without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising
before, on or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may
retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, pay all
fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received and (ii) the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, that none of the
Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or Parent shall be liable for
any settlement or consent decree effected without its prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any DandO Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10 shall notify Parent
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability
which it may have under this Section 6.10 except to the extent such failure
prejudices Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries). The parties
hereto agree that all rights to indemnification hereunder, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any such
action or suit, existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect
to matters occurring through the Closing Date shall continue in full force and
effect from and after the Closing Date; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made
in writing to the Surviving Corporation within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain, if available, and
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the premiums associated with, officers'
and directors' liability insurance covering the persons who are presently
covered by officers' and directors' liability insurance policies (copies of
which have heretofore been delivered to Parent) with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, providing coverage not less
favorable in the aggregate than provided by such insurance in effect on the
date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be obligated to expend in order to obtain or maintain insurance
coverage pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) any amount per annum in excess of
300% of the aggregate premiums currently paid or payable by the Company in
2013 (on an annualized basis) (which aggregate premiums currently paid or
payable by the Company in 2013 (on an annualized basis) are set forth on
Section 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) for such purpose (the
"Maximum Premium"); provided, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, at any time after the date hereof, the Company may, or Parent may
direct the Company to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy that
provides coverage no less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than the
coverage described in this Section 6.10(b); provided, further, that the cost
of such "tail" policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium.

  

  

(c) Parent covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that, after
the Effective Time, it and they shall not institute any action or proceeding
in any court or before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal
against any of the current directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
their capacity as such, with respect to any liabilities, actions, or causes of
actions, judgments, claims, or demands of any nature or description
(consequential, compensatory, punitive, or otherwise), in each case to the
extent resulting from their approval of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) During the six (6)-year period following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall not amend, restate or otherwise modify the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation or of its bylaws with respect to indemnification
of and expense advancement or reimbursement to DandO Indemnified Parties in a
manner that adversely affects any DandO Indemnified Party.

Section 6.11 Challenges. The Company shall give Parent reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of any stockholder litigation against the
Company or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent
the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be
made by the Company in connection with any such litigation, and the right to
consult on the settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company
will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably
and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, upon the request of Purchaser, take all
reasonable steps to assist in any challenge by Purchaser to the validity or
applicability of any state takeover law to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.12 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter. In
the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent and Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a
whole) to Parent and Purchaser than the terms and conditions (taken as a
whole) set forth in the Commitment Letter ("Alternative Committed Financing"),
including from alternative sources, following the occurrence of such event.
Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company prompt written notice upon
becoming aware of any breach by any party of the Commitment Letters or any
termination of the Commitment Letters. Parent and Purchaser shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing or the Alternative Committed
Financing, as the case may be, and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
any Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to receive the Financing or the Alternative Committed Financing, as
the case may be, at or before the Closing or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and Purchaser shall provide written notice to the
Company promptly upon receiving the Financing or the Alternative Committed
Financing, as the case may be.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46

Parent and Purchaser, in each case at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser that is customary in connection
with the arrangement of the type of Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (provided in all cases that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), which reasonable best efforts shall include (i) (A) furnishing
Parent and Purchaser and their Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following Parent's or Purchaser's request, with such pertinent and

Affiliates shall be required, in connection with the matters covered by this
Section 6.13, to (i) waive any of the conditions to this Agreement set forth
in Article VII, or (ii) to agree to any restrictions on the conduct of their
existing or future business activities (including the Business) or to divest
or agree to divest or surrender control of any of their current or future
assets or businesses in order to obtain any consents or approvals of any
Governmental Authority or to otherwise remove any impediments to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if so doing
would result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

  

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall consider in good faith the views of the
Company, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Laws. The Company shall, subject to Applicable Law, consult and
cooperate with Parent as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and consider
in good faith the views of Parent, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws.

(c) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company, subject to any restrictions
under Applicable Law, will promptly notify the other parties hereto of any
communication made to or received by it from any applicable Governmental
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and, if
practicable, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the
other parties' reasonable comments, not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend, and furnish the other parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one hand and any such
Governmental Authority or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the parties agree that, except as otherwise provided
by Applicable Law, any and all proceedings, hearings and other dealings with
Governmental Authorities relating to antitrust matters shall be led by Parent
and its Representatives; provided, that Parent may make all final strategic
decisions after consulting in good faith with the Company.

  

  

(d) Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under the
any Antitrust Law.

the Company's Board of Directors shall take all steps necessary to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any disposition of
Common Stock in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is or
will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Closing Date, the Company shall make available to Parent complete and correct
copies of title evidencing the Company or its Subsidiaries ownership of the

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company (with any termination by Parent also
being an effective termination by Purchaser):

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either of Parent or the Company if (i) a statute, rule, executive order
or other Applicable Law shall have been enacted, entered, or promulgated by
any Governmental Authority prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement or making the consummation of the
Merger illegal or (ii) any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action, in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree,

Section 8.1(b) shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under Section 6.5, Section 6.8 and Section 6.13;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by either of Parent or the Company if the consummation of the Merger shall
not have occurred on or before February 26, 2014 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(c) shall not have breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement; provided further, however, that if the
failure to consummate the Merger by the Termination Date is due solely to a
delay in (i) satisfying the condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) and/or (ii)
clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement, the date referred to in this
Section 8.1(c) as the "Termination Date" shall be the earlier of (1) April 26,
2014 (provided that Parent may extend such date to May 26, 2014 upon notice to
the Company given on or before April 26, 2014 if the failure to consummate the
Merger by April 26, 2014 is due solely to a delay in satisfying the condition
set forth in Section 7.1(c)) or (2) five (5) Business Days after both of the
following have occurred: (A) the satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(c) and (B) this Agreement shall have been adopted by the
affirmative vote of the holders of the requisite number of shares of capital
stock of the Company in accordance with the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation, the DGCL, and other Applicable Law.

  

  

(d) by either Parent or the Company if the required approval of the
stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained at the Stockholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to the Company where
the failure to obtain the approval of the stockholders of the Company shall
have been caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such
action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Company of this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if, prior to such time as the stockholders of the Company adopt this
Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company's Board of Directors shall
have entered into any definitive Acquisition Proposal Documentation with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.7; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(i) unless (x) the Company has complied with
the requirements of Section 6.7 that the Company is required to satisfy before
taking action pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and (y) prior to or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays the fee due under Section 8.3; or

  

  

(ii) if (A) there shall be a breach of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Purchaser in this Agreement, or (B) there shall be a breach by
Parent or Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach, in the case of clause (A)or (B), (x) would give rise
to the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (y)
either is not capable of being cured or, if it is capable of being cured, has
not been cured by the twentieth (20th) Business Day following written notice
to Parent from the Company of such breach; provided, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(ii) if Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, is using reasonable best efforts to cure such breach
and such breach could reasonably be expected to be cured by the Termination
Date (as determined in accordance with Section 8.1(c)); provided further, that
the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e)(ii) if the Company is in material breach of this Agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if the Marketing Period has been completed and the conditions to closing
set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 are satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied) and Parent and Purchaser
are unable to satisfy their obligation to effect the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 because of a
Financing Failure; provided, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(iii) if the Company is in material breach of
this Agreement; or

  

  

(iv) if the Termination Date has lapsed and the conditions to closing set
forth in Sections 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(c)) and 7.3 are satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied) and Parent and Purchaser are unable to satisfy their obligation to
effect the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2 because of a failure to satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(c); provided, that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(iv) if the Company is in material
breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) by Parent or Purchaser:

  

  

(i) if the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A)
effected a Change of Recommendation, (B) entered into any Acquisition Proposal
Documentation, or (C) failed to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation upon the reasonable written request therefor by Parent by the
earlier of ten (10) Business Days following a reasonable written request by
Parent and two (2) Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting;

  

  

(ii) if (A) there shall be a breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company in this Agreement or (B) there shall be a breach by the Company of any
of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach, in
the case of clause (A) or (B), (x) would give rise to the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and (y) either is not capable
of being cured or, if it is capable of being cured, has not been cured by the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following written notice to the Company from
Parent or Purchaser of such breach; provided, that Parent or Purchaser may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f)(ii) if the Company is
using reasonable best efforts to cure such breach and such breach could
reasonably be expected to be cured by the Termination Date (as determined in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)); provided further, that Parent or Purchaser
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f)(ii) if Parent
or Purchaser is in material breach of this Agreement; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if the Company shall have committed a willful and material breach of its
obligations or agreements contained in Section 6.7.

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent or Purchaser as provided in Section
8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Purchaser, or the Company,
other than the provisions of Section 6.4, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, and
Article IX; provided that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
8.4, nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any
willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to termination.

  

  

Section 8.3 Termination Fee. In the event that (a) Parent or Purchaser
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) (other than as a
result of a Change of Recommendation related to an Intervening Event), (b) the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) or (c) (i)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f)(ii),
(ii) any Person shall have publicly disclosed or shall have made known to the
Company's Board of Directors a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof and prior to such termination, and (iii) within twelve (12) months of
such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummated an Acquisition Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this clause (iii) the references to "20%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%"), then in each case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent, concurrently with the time of termination in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i), as promptly as is reasonably practicable (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days) in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) or concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (c)(iii) of this Section 8.3, an
amount (the "Termination Fee") equal to $20,819,000. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section
8.1(f)(i)(A) as a result of a Change of Recommendation related to an
Intervening Event pursuant to Section 6.7(e)(ii) or (ii) the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and prior to the Stockholders Meeting the Company's
Board of Directors has made a Change of Recommendation related to an
Intervening Event pursuant to Section 6.7(e)(ii), then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent as promptly as is reasonably practicable (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days) an amount (the "Intervening
Event Termination Fee") equal to $32,030,000. Except with respect to any fraud
or willful and material breach of this Agreement by the Company, Parent's
receipt of full payment of the Termination Fee or Intervening Event
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be the exclusive remedy of
Parent or Purchaser against the Company or any of its stockholders, partners,
members, affiliates, directors, officers or agents for any loss suffered as a
result of breach of this Agreement by the Company or the failure of the Merger
to be consummated upon termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 8.3 shall limit the rights of Parent and Purchaser
under Section 9.11. Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 and in Section 8.4 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to
Section 8.3 or 8.4, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the amounts
set forth in Section 8.3 or 8.4, as applicable, such party shall pay other
party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
due pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 8.3 or 8.4, as
applicable, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.4 Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(iii), (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(iv) or (iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) due to
a final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling enjoining or prohibiting or
otherwise making illegal consummation of the Merger, in each case, under any
Antitrust Law, then within two (2) Business Days following such termination
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company an aggregate amount equal
to $41,639,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"); provided, however, that in the
event that this Agreement is so terminated after April 26, 2014, the "Parent
Termination Fee" shall be an aggregate amount equal to $48,045,000. The
parties understand and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement, if Parent
and Purchaser fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 or fail to perform hereunder as a
result of a Financing Failure or a failure to satisfy the condition set forth
in Section 7.1(c), then the Company's and its Affiliates' sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
Parent, Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Financing Sources and their
respective Representatives and assignees for any breach, loss or damage shall
be to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Parent Termination
Fee only to the extent provided by Section 8.4(a), and none of Parent,
Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Financing Sources or their respective
Representatives or assignees will have any liability or obligation to the
Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The
Financing Sources (and such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
Representatives) are express third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.4(b).

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

Section 9.1 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in this Agreement,
or in any agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights
arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Effective Time, except for
those covenants, agreements, and other provisions contained herein that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.2 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. In the event of
termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its own
expenses will be subject to any rights of such party arising from a breach of
this Agreement by another party and any rights of such party to receive a
Termination Fee, Intervening Event Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee,
as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.3 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, and supplemented by the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Closing Date (notwithstanding any stockholder approval); provided, however,
that after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment shall be made that, under Applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, Sections
8.4(b), 9.5, 9.10 and 9.13(b) may not be amended or modified in a manner that
would be adverse to the Financing Sources (or such Financing Source's
Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and Representatives) without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources.

  

  

Section 9.4 Extension. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party.

  

  

Section 9.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent permitted pursuant to Applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or
(b) subject to Applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other parties contained herein, except that there shall be
no waiver to Section 8.4(b), 9.3, 9.5, 9.10, or 9.13 (or any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a waiver such provision would modify the substance of
Section 8.4(b), 9.3, 9.5, 9.10, or 9.13) in a manner that would be adverse to
the Financing Sources (or such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
Representatives) without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of such party. Neither the failure nor any delay
by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power or privilege. A waiver with reference to one event
shall not be construed as continuing or as a bar to or waiver of any right,
power, privilege or remedy as to a subsequent event. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereto are neither cumulative nor alternative.

Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of such notice
unless the Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not

and, within four (4) Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the

contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact, in each case with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
necessary in order to make the statement contained in such Required

case the Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence until all such
Required Information has been corrected or disclosed; and provided, further,

Section 9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits or
Schedules, if any, and other agreements and instruments delivered in
connection herewith) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto, and supersedes all prior written
agreements, arrangements, communications, and understandings, and all prior
and contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications, and
understandings, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person (including any current or former employees of the Company) any right,
benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the DandO
Indemnified Parties are express third party beneficiaries of Section 6.10 and
(b) each Financing Source (and such Financing Source's Affiliates,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and Representatives) is an express third party beneficiaries of each
provision of this Agreement expressly intended for its benefit, including
Sections 8.4(b), 9.3, 9.5, and 9.13 and this Section 9.10.

  

  

Section 9.11 Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including by failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or anticipated breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, including, without limitation, (i) to enforce
the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, Section 6.8
by Parent or Purchaser, and (ii) to cause Parent and Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, if and as required pursuant to the terms
and conditions hereof, including to effect the Closing on or prior to the date
the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
as provided herein on the basis that (i) any party hereto has an adequate
remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such injunction or order. The parties
further agree that (A) by seeking the remedies provided for in Section
9.11(a), a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other
form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement and (B)
nothing contained in this Section 9.11 shall require any party to initiate any
Claim for (or limit any party's right to institute any Claim for) specific
performance under this Section 9.11 before exercising any initiate right under
Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the
commencement of any Claim pursuant to this Section 9.11 or anything contained
in this Section 9.11 restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parent's and Purchaser's obligations to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the
Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
and 7.3 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), (ii) Parent and
Purchaser fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (iii) there has not been a Financing
Failure, and (iv) the Company has confirmed in a written notice delivered to
Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded,
then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Section 9.11 and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 8.4), under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both
such grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

Section 9.12 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied
because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware.

  

  

Section 9.13 Submission to Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or related to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect hereof brought by any other party hereto or its
successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery

irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure lawfully to serve
process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties to this Agreement: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support
any Person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Financing Source (or such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
Representatives) for any portion of the Financing in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii)
agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, all
claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources (or such Financing Source's
Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and Representatives) in any way relating to the Commitment
Letter, any of the agreements or documents relating to or entered into in
connection with the Financing or the Commitment Letter or the performance of
any services thereunder (the "Financing Documents") or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment
Letter or the Financing Documents or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (A) neither the Company nor any of its employees, officers,
directors, stockholders or Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source (or such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
Representatives) in respect of any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or Financing Documents or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise; provided, however, that this clause (A) shall not affect
the rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under the Commitment Letter or
any of the Financing Documents and (B) no Financing Source (or such Financing
Source's Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and Representatives) shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of the Company or any of
its employees, officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
Financing Documents or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
provided, however, that this clause (A) shall not affect the rights of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries under the Commitment Letter or any of the Financing
Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources (and such Financing Source's Affiliates,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and Representatives) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and
shall be entitled to the protections of this Section 9.13(b) and this Section
9.13(b) shall not be amended, modified or changed without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources. For the avoidance of any doubt, this Section
9.13(b) does not alter, modify, supplement or change, in any respect, the
rights and obligations of any Financing Source to Parent and its Subsidiaries
as set forth in the Commitment Letter.

Section 9.14 Assignment, Successors. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without

assignment shall be effective only after (a) an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement to effectuate such assignment shall have been executed by the
parties hereto and any such Assignee and (b) such amendment, or this Agreement
as so amended, shall have received all approvals required by the DGCL. Subject
to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed, and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein.
