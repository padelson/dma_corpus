Closing Date as if it were the last day of the plan year (a Pro-Rata Matching
Contribution); _provided_ that, if the Company DC Plan is not to be terminated
in accordance with this Section 6.8(d), prior to the date of making such
contribution, the Company DC Plan and any employee communications with

the matching contribution with respect to the portion of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs that elapses following the Closing Date shall be
reduced by the Pro-Rata Matching Contribution for the period between the
Closing Date and the end of the plan year. If the Sellers elect to cause the
Company to make a Pro-Rata Matching Contribution, the Company shall

action as is necessary to implement the Pro-Rata Matching Contribution. The

connection with the Pro Rata Matching Contribution shall be subject to the
reasonable review and approval of the Buyer. If the Sellers do not elect to

resolve such items. If the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to reach such
agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Buyer of such notice, the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm and any determination
by the Accounting Firm shall be final. The Accounting Firm shall resolve any
disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Accounting Firm is

days prior to the due date for filing the relevant Pre-Closing/Straddle Tax
Return (taking into account extensions) or (y) ten (10) days after demand

taxable year of the Company and Company Subsidiaries beginning after the
Closing Date.

Sellers shall inform the Buyer of such change prior to undertaking such
transfer. To the extent that any transfer contemplated by this _Section

Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, thereafter hold such Excluded Assets
in trust for the use and benefit of the Sellers (at the expense of the

shall be construed as (i) creating any obligation on the Sellers and their
Affiliates to bring or prosecute actions against third parties for
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Company-Required IP,
(ii) creating any obligation on the Sellers and their Affiliates to secure
and/or maintain any Company-Required IP, or (iii) preventing the Company and

   6.14 | Estimated Closing Working Capital

or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) shall have been satisfied or
waived by the party entitled to waive the same, but no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause
the Company to deliver to the Buyer a statement (the Working Capital

of the Company, setting forth the Companys good-faith estimate of the Net
Working Capital as of the anticipated Closing Date in the same form as the
Reference Working Capital Statement (the Estimated Closing Working Capital),
which may be a positive or negative number, and its good-faith estimate of
Closing Cash as of the anticipated Closing Date (the Estimated Closing Cash).
The Working Capital Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Closing
Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash shall be prepared in accordance
with Accounting Principles and shall take into account any cash dividend or
cash distribution described in _Section 6.14(b)_. Between the delivery of the
Working Capital Statement and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the
Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries books, records and work papers relating to the Working
Capital Statement for the purpose of evaluating the Working Capital Statement,
the calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital and the calculation of

comments with respect to the Working Capital Statement and, to the extent
necessary to conform to the Accounting Principles, to modify the
Working Capital Statement and calculation of the Estimated Closing Working
Capital and Estimated Closing Cash prior to the Closing, which revised
statement and calculation shall be deemed to be the Working Capital Statement,
the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Cash for all
purposes under this Agreement. 
---|---

Cash shall be greater than $4,000,000, then, at the Closing, the Buyer shall

completed prior to the Closing Date, the parties agree that the term sheets
attached to this Agreement shall be binding with respect to the parties hereto

_7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ , _7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ (as applicable) not to be

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | by the Buyer (if it is not in breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ not to
be satisfied), upon written notice to the Sellers, if there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ to be incapable of being satisfied
prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , however, if such breach is
curable, then the Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if,

---|---|--- 
 



34 representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so

 not to be satisfied), upon written notice to the Buyer, if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause any of the conditions
set forth in  _Sections 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ to be incapable of being
satisfied prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , however, if such breach
is curable, then the Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement

   8.2 | Effect of Termination 
---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect; _provided_ ,

from any liability for such partys Willful Breach of the provisions of this
Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement.



   8.3 | Termination Fee 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event this

event that one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)_ has not been satisfied (and, in the case of _Section
7.1(b)_, only if the failure to satisfy such condition is a result of an Order
or injunction pursuant to an Antitrust Law) or _Section 8.1(e)_ if such Order
or Law is, or is pursuant to, an Antitrust Law and (ii) at the time of such
termination, all other conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and
_7.3_ shall have been satisfied or waived (as if the date of termination were
the Closing Date), then the Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay the Sellers a
termination fee of $70,000,000 (the Termination Fee) in cash by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and that, without this right, the Sellers
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Buyer fails
to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and in order
to obtain such payment the Sellers commence an Action that results in a
judgment against the Buyer for the fee set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or any
portion of such fee, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers their costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such Action, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the Interest Rate in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms and such termination gives rise to
the obligation of the Buyer to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 8.3 and the Buyer shall have paid the Termination Fee, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers and its Affiliates against the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates for any
Losses resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this
Agreement (including termination thereof) shall be the Termination Fee, and no
Person shall have any rights or claims against the Buyer and its 

 



35  Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates under
this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and none of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation
resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this
Agreement.

nor the Seller Indemnified Persons (in respect of  _Section 9.3(i)_) shall
be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2(i)_ or
_Section 9.3(i)_, as the case may be, with respect to a single course of

reduction of Taxes otherwise payable by the Indemnified Person arising from
the circumstances giving rise to the claim for such Losses or Taxes, in each
case, in or prior to the taxable year in which the relevant indemnification
payment is made and (ii) increased by any Taxes actually paid (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Tax required to be deducted or withheld by the
payor of such payment) or any Tax benefit actually lost in respect of or
attributable to such indemnity payment. 
---|--- 



   (e) |

In no event shall any Indemnified Person have any Liability for (i) Losses

special, speculative, indirect or consequential Losses or lost 

---|--- 
 



37 foreseeable consequence of the relevant breach or (iii) punitive damages,
except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent awarded against an
Indemnified Person in connection with a Third-Party Claim. In no event shall
any party be indemnified against any Loss arising out of a breach of any
representation and warranty or covenant or agreement of the other party, if
the first party had knowledge at or before the date hereof of such breach or
the facts underlying such breach. 
---|--- 



   (f) | In order to avoid double recovery, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any
amount to the extent such person or its Affiliate has been indemnified or
reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (g) | Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. Upon making any payment to the
Indemnified Person for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article 9_
, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to any rights which the Indemnified Person may have against any third parties
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and
the Indemnified Person shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party. 
---|--- 
 



   (h) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a)
neither the Sellers nor any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agent, partners, managers, members
or stockholders (other than, to the extent applicable, the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries) shall have any rights or claims against the entities that have
committed to provide, arrange or otherwise entered into agreements in
connection with the Financing (together with their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agent, partners, managers, members or
stockholders, collectively the financing sources), in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith arising out of or relating in any way to any
agreements relating to any Financing or the performance thereof, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) and (b) such financing
sources shall not have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to the Sellers or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agent, partners, managers, members or
stockholders (other than, to the extent applicable, the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries) for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith arising out of or relating in any way to any financing commitment
letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. 
---|--- 



   9.5 | Notice of Claims 
---|--- 

If any third party (i.e., any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or
an Affiliate thereof) provides notice to an Indemnified Person of any action,
suit, proceedings, claim or demand (a Third-Party Claim) with respect to any
matter for which such Indemnified Person is indemnified under this  _Article
9_ that has or may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder against
an Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Person will promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty (20) days of receipt of such Third-Party Claim)
give written notice thereof (a Claim Notice) to the Indemnifying Party, which
Claim Notice shall describe all material facts and circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Person giving rise to such Third-Party Claim and the claimed
items and amounts of Losses with respect thereto, to the

 



38  extent then known by the Indemnified Person, as well as the provisions of
this Agreement that are the bases for the indemnification claim with respect
to such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that, subject to _Section 9.1_, no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying
Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this
_Article 9_ , except to the extent such delay actually and materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party.



   9.6 | Assumption of Defense 
---|--- 



   (a) |

The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim
Notice to elect, at its option, to assume and control the defense of, at its
own expense and by its own counsel, any such Third-Party Claim and shall be
entitled to assert any and all defenses available to the Indemnified Person to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; _provided_ that, prior to
the Indemnifying Party assuming and controlling such defense, it shall first
confirm to the Indemnified Person in writing that, assuming the facts then
presented to the Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Person being true, the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Person for any such Losses
to the extent resulting from, or arising out of, such Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense
and, in the course of defending such Third-Party Claim, (x) the Indemnifying
Party discovers that the facts presented at the time the Indemnifying Party
acknowledged its indemnification obligation in respect of such Third-Party
Claim were not true and (y) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for
asserting that the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be bound by such acknowledgment, (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly thereafter provide the Indemnified Person written notice of its
assertion that it does not have an indemnification obligation in respect of
such Third-Party Claim and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim (it being agreed that all costs
and expenses in conducting such defense prior to the date that the Indemnified
Person shall have the ability to assume the defense, including costs and
expenses of counsel, shall be the responsibility of the Indemnifying Party
and not the Indemnified Person). If the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to
compromise or defend any such Third-Party Claim, it shall promptly notify the
Indemnified Person of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Person
agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense against, any such
Third-Party Claim, including by furnishing nonprivileged books and records,
personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the relief
consists solely of money damages and includes a provision whereby
the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Buyer Indemnified
Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, from all liability with
respect thereto. Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such
action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the Indemnified Person shall
have determined in good faith after consultation with counsel that an actual
or potential conflict of interest makes representation by the same counsel or
the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have authorized in writing the Indemnified Person to
employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys expense. In any event, the
Indemnified Person and Indemnifying Party and their counsel shall cooperate
in the defense of any Third-Party Claim subject to this _Article 9_ and keep
such Persons informed of all developments relating to any such Third-Party
Claims, and provide copies of all relevant correspondence and
documentation relating thereto. All costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the Indemnified Persons cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. In any event, the Indemnified Person shall have the right at its own
expense to participate in the defense of such asserted liability. If the
Indemnifying Party receiving such notice of Third-Party Claim does not elect
to defend, 

---|--- 
 



39 Person shall have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may
have hereunder, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, to defend such Third-
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Indemnified Persons
defense of or participation in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim shall
not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this _Article 9_ ; and (ii) the Indemnified Person shall not settle,
compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such
Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the case of a
Third-Party Claim related to both (x) Taxes for which the Sellers have an
indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_ and (y) Taxes for
which Buyer is responsible (a Joint Tax Claim) (and the portion of such Joint
Tax Claim related to Taxes described in clause (x) is not separable from the
portion of such Joint Tax Claim related to Taxes described in clause (y)),
the Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its
own expense, such Joint Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Joint Tax Claim, (B) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Joint Tax Claim, (C) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the
Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Joint Tax Claim, (D)
the Controlling Party shall defend such Joint Tax Claim diligently and in good
faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Joint
Tax Claim, (E) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Joint Tax Claim and attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant
Taxing Authority, and (F) the Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Joint Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written
consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. For purposes of this Agreement, Controlling
Party shall mean the Sellers, if the Sellers and their Affiliates
are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with
such Joint Tax Claim, or the Buyer, if Buyer and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Joint Tax
Claim (taking into account any potential liability in subsequent Tax
periods); and Non-Controlling Party shall mean whichever of the Sellers or the
Buyer is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Joint Tax Claim. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | As promptly as is reasonably practicable (but in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days) after becoming aware of a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement not involving a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party of
such claim. Each party hereto also agrees that any direct claim which such
party may bring against any other party hereto under the provisions of this
Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this _Article 9_
, other than _Section 9.6(a)_. 
---|--- 



   9.7 | Exclusive Remedy 
---|--- 

The parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the remedies provided for
in this _Article 9_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for all
Losses that any Indemnified Person may suffer or incur arising from or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any other rights or remedies
(whether at law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort, statute or
otherwise) that they may otherwise have had, now have or may in the future
have against any of the other parties hereto or any of the respective direct
or indirect Affiliates, officers, managers, directors, employees, advisors,
stockholders, members, consultants, investment bankers, brokers, controlling
persons, partners, managers or other representatives or agents thereof (each
of whom shall be an express third-party beneficiary hereof) arising from or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
covenant not to sue or otherwise assert any claim encompassed by the
foregoing covenant, agreement and waiver; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the parties rights to specific performance as
contemplated by _Section 10.14 _with respect to covenants to be performed
after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and shall not limit any remedy
for fraud or Willful Breach.

 



40 ---|--- 

The parties will treat any payment received pursuant to  _Section 6.10_ or
this _Article 9_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
