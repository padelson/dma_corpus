in the other appellate courts therefrom or other courts of Bermuda. Each party irrevocably and

proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Chosen
Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim

court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent legally effective, over the
subject matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
