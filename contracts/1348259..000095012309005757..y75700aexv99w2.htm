ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF IPC SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 2.1 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder of any common shares in IPC, each having a par value of $0.01 (each, an " _IPC Common Share_ "), as evidenced by way of entry in the register of shareholders of IPC (the " _IPC Share Register_ ") or by share 

    ##### 

  

    

certificates registered in the name of a shareholder and representing
outstanding IPC Common Shares (each, a " _IPC Certificate_ "): 

    

 (a) _Conversion of IPC Common Shares_. Each IPC Common Share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive shares in the share capital of Validus, each having a par value of $0.175 (each, a " _Validus Common Share_ ") equal to 1.2037 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") (the Exchange Ratio, together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), the " _Amalgamation Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, each IPC Common Share shall be cancelled and each holder of shares registered in the IPC Share Register or holding a valid IPC Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration. The Amalgamation Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Validus Common Shares or IPC Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Validus Common Shares or IPC Common Shares having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Validus-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all IPC Common Shares that are owned by Validus or by any subsidiary of Validus immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

   

 (c) _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding IPC Common Shares held by a person who did not vote in favor of the Amalgamation and who complies with all the provisions of the Companies Act concerning the right of holders of IPC Common Shares to require appraisal of their IPC Common Shares pursuant to Bermuda Law (such shareholder, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ", and such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall, at the Effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), and the right to receive the excess thereof, if any, as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106 of the Companies Act. In the event that a Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal, its IPC Common Shares shall be cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration for each such Dissenting Share. IPC shall give Validus ( _i_ ) prompt notice of ( _A_ ) any written demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands received by IPC and ( _B_ ) to the extent that IPC has actual knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares, and ( _ii_ ) the opportunity to participate with IPC in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Neither IPC nor Validus shall, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Validus shall designate an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to IPC (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging IPC Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Validus shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this 

   ##### 

  

   

ARTICLE II, certificates, or at Validuss option, shares in book entry form
representing the Validus Common Shares to be exchanged in the Amalgamation,
cash in an amount sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions to which
the shareholders of IPC may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
Such Amalgamation Consideration and cash so deposited are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the IPC Certificates on cash amounts payable
upon the surrender of such certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Validus or the Amalgamated Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, to each shareholder of IPC, ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify) and ( _ii_ ) where applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of IPC Certificates, to the extent available and in issue, in exchange for the Amalgamation Consideration. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the IPC Common Shares previously held by a shareholder of IPC in accordance with this Section 2.2, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed if such shareholder holds IPC Certificates, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, a holder of IPC Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or book-entry representing that number of whole Validus Common Shares and any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II, and any IPC Certificate surrendered in respect thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of IPC Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of IPC, a certificate or book-entry representing the proper number of Validus Common Shares may be issued to a transferee if the IPC Certificate representing such IPC Common Shares (if any) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Validus Common Shares with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to any shareholder of IPC holding any unsurrendered IPC Certificate with respect to the Validus Common Shares represented thereby, nor shall the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid to any such shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until such shareholder shall surrender such IPC Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE II. Following the surrender of any such IPC Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE II, such shareholder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(a), without interest, ( _i_ ) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole Validus Common Shares which a shareholder of IPC holding such IPC Certificate is entitled to receive hereunder, and ( _ii_ ) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Validus Common Shares which such shareholder is entitled to receive hereunder. 

   

 (d) _No Further Rights in IPC Common Shares_. All Amalgamation Consideration paid or issued upon the surrender of title to IPC Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II (including any cash paid pursuant to this ARTICLE II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of IPC, in their capacity as shareholders of IPC prior to the Effective Time. There shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Amalgamated Company of the IPC Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, IPC Certificates are presented to Validus or to the Amalgamated Company or to the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be marked as cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this ARTICLE II, except as otherwise required by Law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no fraction of a Validus Common Share will be issued in connection with the Amalgamation, and in lieu thereof any shareholder of IPC who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Validus Common Share, shall be paid upon surrender of title to IPC Common Shares for exchange (and after taking into account and aggregating IPC Common Shares represented by all IPC Certificates surrendered by such holder, or as set out in the IPC Share Register, as applicable) cash in an amount (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying ( _i_ ) the fractional share interest to which such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating all IPC Common Shares represented by all IPC Certificates surrendered by such shareholder or as set out in the IPC Share Register, as applicable) would otherwise be entitled by ( _ii_ ) the Average Validus Share Price (as defined in Section 8.13(a)). 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any IPC Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this ARTICLE II in respect of the IPC Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates; _provided_ that Validus may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Validus or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by applicable Law or Validuss agreement with the Exchange Agent, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of IPC for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Validus, upon demand, and any shareholders of IPC who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Validus for payment of their claim for the Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Validus Common Shares. 

   

 (h) _No Liability_. To the extent allowed under applicable Law, any Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Validus Common Shares comprising the Amalgamation Consideration that remain undistributed to the shareholders of IPC shall be delivered to and become the property of Validus on the day immediately prior to the day that such property is required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. None of Validus, Amalgamation Sub, Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of IPC for any such property delivered to Validus or to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, Validus and the Amalgamated Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any shareholder of IPC such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Validus or the Amalgamated Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the IPC Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The parties agree to cooperate with each other for purposes of determining whether any taxes are required to be withheld with respect to the Amalgamation. 

   

 2.3 _IPC Equity Awards_. 

   

 (a) _IPC Stock Options_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on 

   ##### 

  

   

the part of any holder of any outstanding option to purchase IPC Common Shares
under any IPC Share Plan (as defined in Section 3.2(a)), whether vested or
unvested, exercisable or unexercisable (each, an " _IPC Share Option_ "),
each IPC Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire IPC Common Shares and
shall be converted into an option (a " _New Option_ ") to purchase, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the terms of the IPC Share
Plan under which the IPC Share Option was granted and the applicable award
agreement thereunder (taking into account any accelerated
vesting thereunder), such number of Validus Common Shares and at an exercise
price per share determined as follows: 

    

 (1) _Number of Shares_. The number of IPC Common Shares subject to a New Option shall be equal to the product of ( _A_ ) the number of IPC Common Shares subject to such IPC Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and ( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (2) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per Validus Common Share purchasable upon exercise of a New Option shall be equal to ( _A_ ) the per share exercise price of the IPC Share Option divided by ( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the quotient being rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent. 

  

 The foregoing adjustments shall ( _i_ ) in the case of any IPC Share Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and ( _ii_ ) in the case of any IPC Share Option that is not intended to be an "incentive stock option," be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (b) _IPC Other Awards_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement: 

    

 (1) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive IPC Common Shares or benefits measured by the value of IPC Common Shares, each outstanding award of any kind consisting of IPC Common Shares or benefits measured by the value of IPC Common Shares (including performance share units where the performance period has ended prior to the Effective Date), in each case that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any IPC Share Plan and any other IPC Benefit Plan (as defined in Section 8.13(a)), but excluding IPC Share Options and IPC performance share units for which the performance period expires on or after the Effective Time (the " _IPC Non-Performance Awards_ "), shall be deemed to be converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value of (as the case may be) the number of Validus Common Shares equal to the product (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of IPC Common Shares subject to such IPC Non-Performance Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such right shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the rights under the relevant IPC Share Plan or other IPC Benefit Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder (taking into account any accelerated vesting thereunder) immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

   

 (2) immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on the part of any holder of any IPC performance share unit for which the performance period expires on or after the Effective Time (each a " _Non-Vested PSU_ "), the number of IPC Common Shares to which each Non-Vested PSU relates shall be calculated based on the original grant date target value of the Non-Vested PSU, as 

   ##### 

  

    

pro-rated on a daily basis to each year of the original vesting period (the "
_IPC Performance Awards_ ") and, at the Effective Time, each IPC Performance
Award shall be deemed to be converted into the right to acquire or receive
benefits measured by the value of (as the case may be) the number of Validus
Common Shares equal to the product (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of IPC Common Shares to which each IPC
Performance Award relates immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such right shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the rights under the relevant IPC Share
Plan or other IPC Benefit Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder
(taking into account any accelerated vesting thereunder) immediately prior to
the Effective Time. IPC Performance Awards and IPC Non-Performance Awards
shall be, collectively, referred to as the " _IPC Other Awards_." 

  

 (c) _Corporate Actions_. Before the Effective Time, IPC, or its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, shall take all action necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions of Sections 2.3(a) and (b) and shall take such other actions reasonably requested by Validus to give effect to the foregoing (including obtaining the consent of the holder of or amending the terms of any IPC Share Options, IPC Other Awards or any IPC Share Plan). IPC shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, none of IPC, Validus, the Amalgamated Company or any of their respective subsidiaries will be required to deliver IPC Common Shares or other capital stock of IPC to any person pursuant to or in settlement of IPC Share Options or IPC Other Awards at or after the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the IPC Share Plans or any other IPC Benefit Plan or the Validus Common Shares issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act, Validus shall file with the SEC within five business days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to such interests of Validus Common Shares, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or the prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the relevant IPC Share Plans or other IPC Benefit Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the Validus Common Shares issuable thereunder continues to be required. 

   

 (e) _Notice to Equity Award Holders_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Validus shall deliver to the holders of IPC Share Options and IPC Other Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to any IPC Share Plan or IPC Benefit Plan and agreements evidencing such IPC Share Options and IPC Other Awards and stating that the IPC Share Plans or IPC Benefit Plans and such IPC Share Options and IPC Other Awards and agreements have been assumed by Validus and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Amalgamation and the terms of the IPC Share Plans or IPC Benefit Plans).

 (b) The parties will hold any such information in confidence and neither of the parties nor any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, "Representatives") will disclose any of the information in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of assisting the parties in effecting the Amalgamation (it being understood that such Representatives shall be informed by the party hereto that they represent of your obligations under this Section 5.2(b) and shall be required by you to comply with all such obligations)), (ii) any of such information may be disclosed as required by applicable law or the rules of a national securities exchange and (iii) any other disclosure of such information may be made only with the other partys prior written consent. Each party hereto agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Section 5.2(b) by any of its Representatives and, at its sole expense, to take all commercially reasonable measures (including, but not limited to, court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from breaching this Section 5.2(b). 

   

 5.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will cooperate and consult with the other party with respect to, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Requisite Regulatory Approvals and all other consents, waivers, licenses, registrations, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, requests, authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Amalgamation or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 5.3(a), to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, each party shall, in connection with the above referenced efforts to obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals and any other requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Laws or any approval of a Governmental Entity, use its commercially reasonable efforts to ( _i_ ) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to applicable Laws or by any Governmental Entity and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods and the receipt of all such consents, waivers, licenses, registrations, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, requests, authorizations and clearances under applicable Laws or from such Governmental Entities as soon as practicable, ( _ii_ ) cooperate in all respects with the other party in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by any private party, ( _iii_ ) keep the other party apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and promptly inform the other party of (and upon reasonable request provide copies of) any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by any private party, in each case regarding any other transactions contemplated hereby, ( _iv_ ) permit the other parties, or the other parties legal counsel, to review prior to its submission any 

    ##### 

  

 

communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by any private party, with any other person, ( _v_ ) consult
with the other party in advance of any meeting, conference, conference call,
discussion or communication with, any such Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by any private party, with any other person
and ( _vi_ ) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings, conferences, conference calls, discussions and
communications. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of IPC (and its subsidiaries) or Validus (and its subsidiaries) may, without the prior written consent of the other party, (i) consent to, take or agree or commit to take, any action for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or (ii) consent to or agree to any restriction or limitation for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (including with respect to divesting, selling, licensing, transferring, holding separate or otherwise disposing of any business or assets or conducting its (or its subsidiaries) business in any specified manner), in each case, which would be effective prior to the Effective Time or which would, after the Effective Time, not be immaterial to Validus and its subsidiaries taken together (after giving effect to the Amalgamation). 

   

 (d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Validus and IPC shall ( _i_ ) take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Amalgamation, this Agreement, or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and ( _ii_ ) if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Amalgamation, this Agreement, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Subject to receipt of the Required IPC Vote, IPC shall take such actions as are necessary to amend its bye-laws to reflect the IPC Bye-Law Amendment. 

   

 5.4 _No Change in Recommendation_. 

   

 (a) The board of directors of Validus shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (including by amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), in any manner adverse to IPC, the Validus Recommendation, or publicly propose to, or publicly announce that its board of directors has resolved to take any such action (any of the foregoing, with respect to the Validus Recommendation, a " _Change in Validus Recommendation_ "). The board of directors of IPC shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (including by amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), in any manner adverse to Validus, the IPC Recommendation, or publicly propose to, or publicly announce that its board of directors has resolved to take any such action (any of the foregoing, with respect to the IPC Recommendation, a " _Change in IPC Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Validus Vote, in the case of Validus, or the Required IPC Vote, in the case of IPC, the board of directors of Validus or IPC, as the case may be, may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly announce that its board of directors has resolved to take any such action) the Validus Recommendation, in the case of Validus, or the IPC Recommendation, in the case of IPC, other than, with respect to IPC only, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.5(a)) (for the avoidance of doubt, the conditions under which IPC may make a Change of IPC Recommendation as a result of an Acquisition Proposal are as set forth in Section 5.5), if the board of directors of Validus or IPC, as the case may be, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, concludes in 

    ##### 

  

 

good faith that such action is reasonably likely to be required in order for
the relevant directors to comply with such directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_  that no Change in Validus Recommendation or
Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, may be made unless the
party seeking to make such Change in Validus Recommendation or Change in
IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, ( _i_ ) has not breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Section 5.4, and ( _ii_ ) has
provided a written notice to the other party advising it of its intention to
make a Change in Validus Recommendation or a Change in IPC Recommendation, as
the case may be, and such other party does not, within five business
days following its receipt of such notice, agree to make adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement which obviate the need for the Change
in Validus Recommendation or the Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case
may be, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of Validus or
IPC, as the case may be, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors ( _provided_ that, during such five business day period,
the party seeking to make such Change in Validus Recommendation or Change in
IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors to, negotiate in good faith with the
other party (to the extent the other party desires to negotiate) with respect
to any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either of Validus or IPC of its obligation(s) under Section 5.1 to
submit matters to obtain the Required Validus Vote at the Validus
Shareholders Meeting or the Required IPC Vote at the IPC Shareholders Meeting,
as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the board of directors
of Validus (in the case of a Change in Validus Recommendation) or IPC (in the
case of a Change in IPC Recommendation) shall have effected a Change in
Validus Recommendation or a Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be,
then in submitting such matters to the applicable shareholders meeting, the
applicable board of directors may submit such matters without recommendation,
in which event the applicable board of directors shall communicate the basis
for its lack of a recommendation to the applicable shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
to the extent it determines after consultation with its legal counsel, that
such action is compelled by applicable Law. 

   

 5.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) IPC agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause (and use commercially reasonable efforts to instruct) its and its subsidiaries employees, agents, representatives and advisors (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly: 

    

 (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate (including by providing information) any effort or attempt to make or implement any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, an amalgamation, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 10% or more of the consolidated assets (including, without limitation, stock of its subsidiaries) of it and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the shareholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 10% or more of its total voting power (or of the surviving Validus entity in such transaction) or the voting power of any of its subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by Validus) being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); 

   

 (ii) have, participate or otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement; or 

   

 (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, amalgamation agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) IPC agrees that ( _i_ ) it shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and ( _ii_ ) it shall not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. IPC agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly inform its and its subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and advisors of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.5. 

   

 (c) IPC shall promptly notify Validus of any (i) Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request for information that could reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal received by it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors (including any investment bankers, attorneys or accountants), and (iii) request that could reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal for discussions with or negotiations by, it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors (including any investment bankers, attorneys or accountants), indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy thereof and any related available documentation and correspondence), and in any event IPC shall provide written notice to Validus of any Acquisition Proposal, request for information or request for such discussions or negotiations within 24 hours of such event. IPC will (A) inform the person making such Acquisition Proposal, request for information or request for discussions or negotiations of its obligations under this Agreement and (B) keep Validus reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or request for information or request for discussions or negotiations (including whether such Acquisition Proposal or request for information or request for discussions or negotiations is withdrawn and any material change to the terms thereof). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Required IPC Vote, in the case of IPC (after the expiration of the Notice Period (as hereinafter defined)), the board of directors of IPC concludes that an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5 could be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all the adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by Validus prior to or during the Notice Period), the board of directors of IPC may make a Change in IPC Recommendation; _provided_ that the board of directors of IPC may not make a Change in IPC Recommendation unless ( _i_ ) IPC has provided a written notice to Validus (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Validus that it has received an Acquisition Proposal that could be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and specifying the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof (including a copy thereof and any related available documentation and correspondence) and ( _ii_ ) Validus does not, within five business days following its receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make an offer that, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of IPC after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that, during the Notice Period, IPC shall, and shall cause its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors to, negotiate in good faith with 

    ##### 

  

 

Validus (to the extent Validus desires to negotiate) with respect to such
proposal). The parties understand and agree that to comply with this Section
5.5(d) any revisions to the terms of such Superior Proposal which,
individually or in the aggregate would be material when considering such
Superior Proposal in its totality, shall require IPC to deliver to Validus a
new Notice of Superior Proposal and the commencement of a new Notice
Period. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit IPC, from ( _i_ ) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent applicable with regard to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer, any failure by IPC or its board of directors to recommend that the shareholders of IPC reject such offer within the time period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in IPC Recommendation), or making any legally required disclosure to its shareholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in IPC Recommendation unless the board of directors of IPC expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) or ( _ii_ ) informing any person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.5. 

   

 (f) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any person (other than Validus or its subsidiaries) that did not result from a breach by IPC of this Section 5.5, which the board of directors of IPC concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the person making the Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) is in the long-term best interests of IPC including its shareholders, employees, communities and other stakeholders, taking into account the long-term strategic prospects and other benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and ( _i_ ) is more favorable to IPC, its shareholders and other constituencies than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to all adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by Validus under Section 5.5(d) in response to such Acquisition Proposal), ( _ii_ ) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and ( _iii_ ) that could be reasonably likely to require the board of directors of IPC to make a Change in IPC Recommendation in order to comply with its directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.5(a)(i), except that the reference to "10% or more of its voting power or the voting power of any of its subsidiaries" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more of its total voting power or the voting power of any of its subsidiaries" and the reference to "10% or more of the consolidated assets" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "all or substantially all of the consolidated assets." 

   

 5.6 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Validus and IPC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b -3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of IPC Common Shares or acquisitions of Validus Common Shares (including, in each case, derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of IPC who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to IPC. 

   

 5.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Amalgamation is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except as otherwise provided herein, and except that  

    ##### 

  

 

expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by IPC
and Validus. 

   

 5.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Validus shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (and, in the case of former officers and directors, to the extent permitted by the bye-laws of IPC and the Amalgamated Company prior to the Closing), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of IPC (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of IPC or any of its respective subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by IPC or any of its respective subsidiaries pursuant to the relevant entitys memorandum of association, bye-laws and indemnification agreements and resolutions, if any, in existence on the date hereof. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Validus shall purchase as of the Effective Time, a tail policy to the existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained by IPC with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than the coverage provided by the existing policy of IPC as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Validus be required to expend for the entire tail policy, in excess of 350% of the annual premium currently provided by IPC for its existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance; and _provided_ _further_ that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Validus shall be obliged to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not to exceed such amount. At the request of Validus, IPC shall cooperate with Validus to obtain such a tail policy effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) In the event that Validus or the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or amalgamation or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Validus shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Validus or the Amalgamated Company assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. 

   

 (d) [Reserved]. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.8: ( _i_ ) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and legal representatives and ( _ii_ ) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The press release to be issued after the execution of this Agreement by all parties regarding the Amalgamation shall be a joint press release and thereafter each of Validus and IPC shall, except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any 

    ##### 

  

 

listing agreement with or rules of NASDAQ or the NYSE, as applicable, or by
request of any Governmental Entity, consult with the other party before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
, _however_ , that this consultation obligation shall not apply to any press
release or other public statement relating to any actual or contemplated
litigation between the parties to this Agreement. 

   

 5.10 _Additional Agreements_. In case any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Amalgamated Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, permits, authorizations, immunities and franchises of IPC and its subsidiaries, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers and directors to take all such necessary action. 

   

 5.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. IPC shall give Validus the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any shareholder litigation against IPC or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.12 _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) [Reserved]. 

   

 (b) As of the Closing Date, Validus shall, or shall cause one of its subsidiaries to, continue to employ each person employed by Validus or IPC or any of their respective subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (such employees, collectively, the " _Employees_ "). Except as expressly provided below, nothing contained herein shall restrict Validus in the future in the exercise of its independent, good-faith business judgment as to the terms and conditions under which such employment shall continue, the duration of such employment, the basis on which such employment is terminated or the benefits provided to any Employee. 

   

 (c) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, Validus shall (or shall cause its subsidiaries to) make available to the Employees that immediately prior to the Closing were employed by IPC, employee benefits and compensation opportunities (including salary, wages and bonus opportunity) substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities in effect for IPC employees immediately prior to the Closing. 

   

 (d) Validus and its subsidiaries shall ensure that any Compensation and Benefit Plan in which the Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date shall take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by the Employees with IPC and any of its subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent such service was credited prior to the Closing Date under a comparable Compensation and Benefit Plan of IPC. 

   

 (e) From and after the Closing Date, Validus shall honor all IPC Benefit Plans, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Closing Date; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of Validus to amend or terminate any such plan in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.12. 

   

 5.13 _Listing and Delisting; Reservation for Issuance_. Validus shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the following shares to be approved for listing and quotation on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, no later than the Closing Date: ( _i_ ) all Validus 

    

-38- 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, no later than the Closing Date:
( _i_ ) all Validus Common Shares to be issued in the Amalgamation to IPC
shareholders and ( _ii_ ) all Validus Common Shares to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise or vesting of the IPC Share Options or IPC Other
Awards (collectively, the " _Listed Validus Common Shares_ "). Validus shall
take all action necessary to reserve for issuance, prior to the Closing Date,
any Listed Validus Common Shares that, by their terms and in accordance with
this Agreement, will not be issued until after the Effective Time. Validus
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the IPC Common Shares
to no longer be listed or quoted on NASDAQ and to be deregistered under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. 

   

 5.14 _Dividends_. IPC and Validus shall coordinate the declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends of IPC Common Shares and Validus Common Shares so that holders of IPC Common Shares do not receive dividends on both IPC Common Shares and the Validus Common Shares received in the Amalgamation in respect of any calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on either the IPC Common Shares or the Validus Common Shares received in the Amalgamation in respect of any calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of this Section 5.14 is to ensure that the holders of the Validus Common Shares and IPC Common Shares each receive the same number of quarterly dividends after execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time with respect to such shares. 

   

 5.15 _Tax Treatment_. 

   

 (a) The parties intend the Amalgamation to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the opinions described in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(e) of this Agreement. Each of IPC, Amalgamation Sub and Validus and each of their respective affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Amalgamation to so qualify and to obtain such opinions, and unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by any other provision of this Agreement, shall not take any actions, or cause any actions to be taken, which would reasonably be expected to cause the Amalgamation to fail so to qualify or the opinions to fail to be delivered. 

   

 (b) Validus shall cause (i) Amalgamation Sub to file with the United States Internal Revenue Service a properly completed Form 8832, so as to elect to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes effective at least one day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the Amalgamated Company to file, after the Closing Date, with the United States Internal Revenue Service a properly completed Form 8832, so as to cause it to be treated for U.S. federal tax purposes as a disregarded entity effective as of the Closing Date. 

   

 5.16 _Book Value Calculations_. 

   

 (a) On the first business day after the date of its shareholder meeting held pursuant to Section 5.1, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, either Validus or IPC (the " _Requesting Party_ ") may request, by providing notice in writing delivered to the other party (the " _Non-Requesting Party_ "), that the Non-Requesting Party prepare an estimate of the Non-Requesting Partys book value as of the date that is one (1) business day prior to such shareholder meeting (such date, the " _Measurement Date_ ," and such estimate of book value, a " _Book Value Estimate_ "). 

   

 (b) If a Requesting Party makes a request pursuant to Section 5.16(a), then both the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall each promptly, and in any event within five (5) calendar days, prepare Book Value Estimates and provide such Book Value Estimates, together with reasonable supporting analysis, to each other. If the Requesting Party fails to provide such Book Value Estimate within such five (5) calendar day period, then the Requesting Party shall have no further rights under this 

   ##### 

  

   

Section 5.16 or Sections 7.1(h) or 7.1(i), as the case may be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby agree that, if either party requests a
Book Value Estimate, the Closing Date shall not occur until the agreements
and covenants set forth in this Section 5.16 have been satisfied or waived. 

   

 (c) From and after the time that the Book Value Estimates have both been delivered, each party shall have five (5) calendar days to review the other partys Book Value Estimate and supporting analysis and such other information as the party may reasonably request in connection with its review of the other partys Book Value Estimate. The parties understand and agree that no reserve development occurring from and after the Measurement Date shall increase or reduce either partys Book Value Estimate. 

   

 (d) If either partys Book Value Estimate indicates that such party has experienced a decline in book value of more than 50% from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date (a " _50% Book Value Decline_ "), then the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h) or Section 7.1(i), as appropriate. 

   

 (e) If the parties Book Value Estimates indicate that the percentage decline in either partys book value from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date is more than 20 percentage points greater than the percentage decline of the other partys book value from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date (a " _20% Differential Book Value Decline_ "), then the party with the lesser decline in book value over such period shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h) or Section 7.1(i), as appropriate; _provided_ that, for purposes of measuring the 20% Differential Book Value Decline, if any, the book value of any party that has experienced an increase in book value from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date shall be deemed to have experienced no change in its book value. 

   

 (f) If, after complying with this Section 5.16, neither party has experienced a 50% Book Value Decline or a 20% Differential Book Value Decline, then (i) in accordance with the terms this Agreement, each party shall cooperate and consult with the other party with respect to, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and (ii) if all other conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived as of the third business day after the condition in Section 6.1(a) was satisfied, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a) (as the case may be) or any other provision of this Agreement, no representations or warranties of the Non-Requesting Party set forth in this Agreement need be true and correct as of any date after the third business day after the date on which the condition in Section 6.1(a) was satisfied and any certificate of the Non-Requesting Party delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.3(c) (as the case may be) shall reflect the foregoing.

Each party further irrevocably consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent legally effective, over the subject matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
