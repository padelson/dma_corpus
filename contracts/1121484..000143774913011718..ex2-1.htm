Company has provided a correct and complete copy of each Company Benefit
Plan's plan document (to the extent such plan document is required by law to

Company, nor any Subsidiary has any liability with respect to an Employee
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, or an Employee Benefit Plan
that is described in Section 413(c) of the Code or Section 3(40) of ERISA. The
terms of each Company Benefit Plan as currently in effect that purports to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and any trust which is a part of
any such Company Benefit Plan are subject to a favorable determination letter
or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and each such plan
has been operated and administered in accordance with all Laws (including,
ERISA and the Code). The terms of each other Company Benefit Plan satisfy the
requirements of Laws (including, ERISA and the Code), and each such plan has
been operated and administered in accordance with all Laws (including, ERISA
and the Code). All reporting and disclosure obligations under Laws (including,
ERISA and the Code) with respect to the Company Benefit Plans have been timely
satisfied. Neither the Company nor a Subsidiary has any liability (directly or
indirectly, contingent or otherwise) under any Employee Benefit Plan other
than a Company Benefit Plan. There have been no prohibited transactions (as
described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan which have not been corrected in full with respect to
which any Tax or penalty is due or which are not otherwise exempt under
Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA. If the benefits under a
Company Benefit Plan are funded through a trust, the fair market value of the
assets of such trust equal or exceed the liabilities of such plan. If the
benefits under a Company Benefit Plan are funded through insurance contracts,
such contracts are in full force and effect and all premiums have been paid
when due. If benefits under a Company Benefit Plan are funded from the general
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the liability for funding
such benefits is shown on the books and records of the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with GAAP and any
applicable standards of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The
Shareholder, its Affiliates, the Company and the Subsidiaries have made full
and timely payment of all amounts which are required to be paid as
contributions to each Company Benefit Plan. Except as disclosed on Schedule
4.17, no Company Benefit Plan provides for benefits described in Section 3(1)
of ERISA following a termination of employment except as required under Part 6
of Title I of ERISA, and the Company and the Subsidiaries have complied in all
respects with the healthcare continuation coverage requirements of Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA. Except as set forth on Schedule , there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement with any Person which provides for any payment
to any employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which payment would
fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or which would
exceed the deduction limits under Section 404 of the Code. Except as set forth
on Schedule , neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
contractual obligation to maintain any Company Benefit Plan for any period of
time or to make contributions from its general assets to such plan (other than
premium payments for an insurance contract which are set on a year-to-year
basis and matching contributions as provided in a Company Benefit Plan which
is described in Section 401(k) of the Code), and the Company's participation
in any Company Benefit Plan may be terminated at any time, including a Company
Benefit Plan which is described in Section 401(k) of the Code, without any
early termination fee or penalty becoming due under the terms of any group
annuity or other insurance contract. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) has been operated and administered in compliance with Section
409A of the Code.

which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date within fifteen (15) days after filing the applicable Tax Return
and providing proof of payment by the Purchaser or the Company or any
Subsidiary of such Taxes, except to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a
liability on the Balance Sheet. For purposes of this __, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
shall (y) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days

of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date. Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after

such amount among the assets of the Company (the " _Allocation_ ") in a manner
consistent with Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. The Allocation shall be binding upon Purchaser, Company and
Shareholder unless Shareholder shall, within 30 days of delivery of the
Allocation to Shareholder, provide to Purchaser written notice of its

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to

Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own any interest in, manage,
operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or
control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership
form or otherwise, engaged in the manufacture, sale, distribution or marketing
of any Competing Products in the Territory or the provision of a Competing
Service in the Territory (each, a " _Restricted Business_ "); provided,
however, that the restrictions contained in this Section 7.6 shall not
restrict (i) the acquisition by the Shareholder and its Affiliates, directly
or indirectly, of less than five (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any
publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business or (ii) the
acquisition and operation by the Shareholder and its Affiliates of businesses
engaged in a Restricted Business so long as (x) the revenues from such
Restricted Business constitute less than ten (10) percent of the total
revenues of any business acquired by the Shareholder and its Affiliates
(measured for the four calendar quarters prior to the execution of the
purchase agreement) and (y) the Shareholder and its Affiliates divest such
Restricted Business within twelve (12) months of the closing of the

(b) From the Closing until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Shareholder shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, cause,

disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order.

 



 

 

 

   

 

 



 

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 7.6 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and a
violation of any of the terms of this will cause irreparable injury to the
Purchaser, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and
which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any
breach of this will be inadequate. Therefore, the Purchaser will be entitled
to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights
and remedies provided by this are cumulative and in addition to any other
rights and remedies which the Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in
equity.

 

 



 

(e) The Parties agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final,
nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant
feature of this is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a
lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant
feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and
not against public policy, may be enforced against the applicable Party.

 



 

 

Section 7.7 _Consents_. With respect to each of the Contracts listed on
Schedule 7.7, after the Closing Date, and until such time as such assignment
has become effective, the Shareholder shall use its best efforts (which shall

counterparties to such Contracts) to obtain the consent of all required
parties thereto to the assignment of such Contract and to deliver such
consents to the Purchaser on or prior to October 31, 2013. With respect to the

Steel Corporation, U.S. Steel Tubular Products and/or United States Steel

indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Purchaser Losses_."

The claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, costs, expenses,
penalties, fines and judgments of the Shareholder Indemnified Parties
described in this as to which the Shareholder Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Shareholder Losses_."

 



 

 

 

   

 

 



 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

 



 

(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third
party (including any Governmental Entity) of any complaint or the commencement
of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Party for
any Purchaser Loss or the Shareholder Loss (as the case may be), such
Indemnified Party shall notify the Purchaser or the Shareholder, as the case
may be (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), promptly following the Indemnified
Party's receipt of such complaint or notice of the commencement of such audit,
investigation, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability hereunder with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results in the
forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days thereafter assuming full
responsibility for any Purchaser Losses or Shareholder Losses (as the case may
be) resulting from such audit, investigation, action or proceeding, to assume
the defense of such audit, investigation, action or proceeding, to the extent
such audit, investigation, action or proceeding involves solely monetary
damages, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to
assume the defense of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding if (i)
such claim could result in criminal liability of, or equitable remedies
against, the Indemnified Party; or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes that the interests of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with respect to the such claim are in conflict with one another, and as
a result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests
of the Indemnified Party in such claim. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume, or is not permitted to assume,
the defense of the audit, investigation, action or proceeding on the terms
provided above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, in either case within such twenty (20) day period, or if the
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of the audit,
investigation, action or proceeding in accordance with the preceding sentence,
then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in
any such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel for the
Indemnified Party as incurred; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single audit,
investigation, action or proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or
proceeding for which indemnification is being sought hereunder the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such
action, shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its
own counsel at such Party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all times use reasonable
efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case
may be) reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the
defense of which it is maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each
other with respect to the defense of any such matter.

 



 

 

 

   

 

 



 

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any audit, investigation,
action or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume, or is not permitted to assume, and maintain the defense of such claim
pursuant to Section 9.3(a) or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers,
directors, managers, employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out
of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors,
managers, employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of such
claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not
contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of
the Indemnified Party's Affiliates.

 

 



 

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to
this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim
to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify the basis for
such claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made pursuant to this
. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this
Article IX or the amount thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party
in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party under this , and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on
such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim)
becomes finally determined. In the event the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided above, as
promptly as possible, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying
Party shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual
agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business
Days following the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party in immediately
available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

 

 



 

Section 9.4 _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the
date hereof and terminate as follows:

 



 

 

 

   

 

 



 

(a) (i) with respect to Purchaser Losses arising under (A) with respect to any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in (Organization),
Section 4.2 (Authorization), (Capital Stock), (Absence of Restrictions and
Conflicts), and Section 4.7(c) (Title to Assets), and (Representations
Regarding the Shareholder) or (B) , the Claims Period shall continue
indefinitely (all Purchaser Loses described in this (i), the " _Surviving
Obligations_ "); (ii) with respect to Purchaser Losses arising under with
respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in
(Compliance with Laws), (Tax Returns; Taxes), or (Environmental, Health and
Safety Matters), or under or 0, 0, 0 or 0, the Claims Period shall terminate
on the date that is sixty (60) days following the termination of the
applicable statute of limitations or, if there is no applicable statute of
limitations, the Claims Period shall terminate on the date that is five (5)
years following the Closing Date; and (iii) with respect to all other
Purchaser Losses arising hereunder, the Claims Period shall terminate on the
date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; and

 

 



 

(b) with respect to Shareholder Losses arising under , the Claims Period shall
continue indefinitely.

 



 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last
day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been
properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not
have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 

 



 

Section 9.5 _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against
the Company or the Shareholder for indemnification under this Article IX for
Purchaser Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Purchaser
Losses exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ ") and
then only to the extent that Purchaser Losses exceed the Deductible; provided,
however, the Surviving Obligations and the Shareholder's obligations pursuant
to __ with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty in (Absence of Certain Changes) or (Tax Returns; Taxes) or pursuant
to , , or shall not be subject to the Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt,
payments made by Purchaser pursuant to the Environmental Agreement shall not
be considered Purchaser Losses and shall not be counted towards the
Deductible. The total aggregate amount of the liability of the Shareholder for
Purchaser Losses shall be limited to fifteen (15) percent of the Purchase
Price (the " _Purchaser Cap_ ") provided, however, the Surviving Obligations
and the Shareholder's obligations pursuant to __ with respect to any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in (Absence of Certain Changes),
(Tax Returns; Taxes), (Compliance with Laws), or (Environmental, Health and
Safety Matters), or pursuant to , , Section 9.1(e), , or shall not be subject
to the Purchaser Cap. For purposes of determining the amount of any such
Purchaser Losses (but not for the purpose of determining the existence of any
breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy) with respect to any representation or
warranty of the Shareholder, any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.

 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, excluding (a) any
claim for injunctive or other equitable relief, (b) any claim related to fraud
by the Shareholder, the Company or the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions related to this Agreement, or (c) for matters related to the
Post-Closing Employment Agreements, the indemnification provisions of this are
intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims either the
Shareholder, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, may incur
arising under, from, out of or relating to this Agreement or to the purchase
and sale of the Company. Neither Party nor any other Person will have any
other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract or tort, by law or
equity, it being agreed that all such other entitlements, remedies and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties, to the fullest
extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise set out in the first sentence in
this , the Parties hereby agree that neither Party shall have any remedies or
cause of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any statements,
communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or
warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 

 

   

 

 



 

Section 9.7 _Tax Characterization_.

 



 

 

Indemnification payments under this shall to the extent allowable under
applicable law, be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

Section 10.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

 



 

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any Legal Dispute
shall be brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of Texas or the federal courts located in the State of Texas, and each Party
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,

proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each Party waives any objection to service of process
effected in accordance with or any means allowable under Texas law or
procedure. During the period a Legal Dispute is pending before a court, all
actions, suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other

OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR

ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY AND IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
(I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER

or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of
the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
