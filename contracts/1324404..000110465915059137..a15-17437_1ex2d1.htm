 **ARTICLE I**

 

 **CONTRIBUTION, DISTRIBUTION AND STOCK SALE**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Contribution of the Holdco-Purchased Equity Interests_. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at or prior to the Closing and
prior to the Effective Time, Oxford shall contribute, transfer, convey, assign
and deliver or cause to be contributed, transferred, conveyed, assigned and
delivered to Holdco, and Holdco shall acquire, the Holdco-Purchased Equity
Interests, in each case, free and clear of any Liens.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Consideration for Holdco-Purchased Equity Interests_. The
aggregate consideration payable by Holdco to Oxford for the Holdco-Purchased
Equity Interests shall consist of:

 



 

(a) a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock in an amount equal to (i) the
product of (A) (1) the number of shares of Cambridge Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (2) the
number of shares of Cambridge Common Stock subject to, underlying or issuable
in connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of all Cambridge Equity
Rights as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined using the
treasury stock method) _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is two hundred fifty-six (256) and the denominator of which is seven hundred
forty-four (744) _less_ (ii) the Convertible Bond Share Reduction Amount (the
" _Base Share Consideration_ "); and

 



 

(b) an amount in cash equal to seven hundred million dollars ($700,000,000)
_minus_ the Estimated Net Intercompany Payable and the Estimated Target
Company Excess Net Debt (the " _Election Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at the written election of Holdco (the " _Stock Election_ ")
delivered to Oxford prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that the
Parties will consult in good faith regarding the delivery of any notice of
Stock Election), Holdco may elect to pay in the form of Holdco Common Stock
such portion of the Election Consideration (the " _Election Amount_ ") as
Holdco shall determine in good faith, after prior consultation with Oxford, to
be reasonably necessary to be paid in the form of Holdco Common Stock in order
to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in Article X and maintain the
investment grade rating of Holdcos outstanding Indebtedness, in which case,
the Election Consideration shall consist of:

 



 

(i) an amount in cash equal to seven hundred million dollars ($700,000,000)
_minus_ (A) the Estimated Net Intercompany Payable _minus_ (B) the Estimated
Target Company Excess Net Debt _minus_ (C) the Election Amount (the cash
contemplated by this clause (i), the " _Holdco Cash Consideration_ "); and

 



 

(ii) a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock in an amount equal to (A) the
Election Amount _divided by_ (B) the Cambridge Average Price (the shares of
Holdco Common Stock contemplated by this clause (ii), the " _Additional Share
Consideration_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.3 _Distribution of Distributable Consideration_. As soon as
practicable following its receipt of the Base Share Consideration and prior to
the Effective Time, Oxford shall distribute some or all of the Base Share
Consideration, as determined in the reasonable discretion of Oxford (such
portion, the " _Distributable Consideration_ ") by way of a reduction of the
nominal value of the ordinary shares in the capital of Oxford pro rata to its
stockholders; _provided_ that the Distributable Consideration shall not be
less than the amount sufficient to constitute control of Holdco within the
meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Consideration Notices_. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, (a) Oxford shall deliver to Cambridge a written
notice setting forth (i) its good faith estimate of the Net Intercompany
Payable (the " _Estimated Net Intercompany Payable_ "), (ii) its good faith
estimate of the Target Company Excess Net Debt (the " _Estimated Target
Company Excess Net Debt_ ") and (ii) the amount of Distributable Consideration
and (b) Cambridge shall deliver to Oxford a written notice setting forth (i)
the number of shares of Cambridge Common Stock estimated to be issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the number
of shares of Cambridge Common Stock estimated to be subject to, underlying or
issuable in connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of all
Cambridge Equity Rights as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(determined using the treasury stock method).

 



 

Section 1.5 _No Fractional Shares in Distribution_. No fractional shares of
Holdco Common Stock shall be distributed in connection with the Distribution.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of ordinary
shares of Oxford who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Holdco Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by
certificates (or, if applicable, book-entry shares) of such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of Cambridge
Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
of a cent by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Holdco Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled (the "Fractional Share Cash
Amount"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Tax Treatment of the Contribution and Distribution_. The
Contribution of the Holdco-Purchased Equity Interests by Oxford to Holdco
pursuant to Section 1.1 of this Agreement in exchange for the Base Share
Consideration and the Election Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2 of this
Agreement and the subsequent Distribution of the Distributable Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.3 along with the transactions described in the
Restructuring Steps Plan (collectively, the " _Separation_ ") is intended, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, to be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and a distribution qualifying under Section
355 of the Code. The Restructuring Steps Plan and Section 1.1, Section 1.2,
Section 1.3 and this Section 1.6 are intended to constitute, and are hereby
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of section 368 of
the Code.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Stock Sale of Cambridge-Purchased Equity Interests_. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing and immediately
before the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, Oxford shall cause Oxford Chem 2 to transfer, convey, assign
and deliver to Cambridge (or its designee), and Cambridge (or such designee)
shall acquire, the Cambridge-Purchased Equity Interests, in each case, free
and clear of any Liens.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Consideration for Cambridge-Purchased Equity Interests_. The
aggregate consideration payable by Cambridge (or its designee) to Oxford Chem
2 for the Cambridge-Purchased Equity Interests shall consist of an amount in
cash equal to five hundred seventeen million five hundred thousand dollars
($517,500,000) (the " _Firewater One Consideration_ ").

 



 

Section 1.9 _Repayment of Net Intercompany Balance_.

 



 

(a) At Closing, Holdco shall cause the relevant Target Companies to pay to the
Oxford Companies an amount of cash equal to the Estimated Net Intercompany
Payable in satisfaction thereof, as set forth in the Restructuring Steps Plan.

 



 

(b) No more than 30 days following the Closing, Oxford shall deliver to Holdco
notice of Oxfords determination of the Net Intercompany Payable as of the
Closing Date. To the extent that the Net Intercompany Payable is greater than
the Estimated Net Intercompany Payable, the Parties shall treat Oxford as
having paid an amount of cash equal to the difference to Holdco as an
adjustment to the cash portion of the Election Consideration (to the extent
thereof, and thereafter as an adjustment to the share portion of the Election
Consideration), and Holdco as having then used that cash to repay the amounts
owed by Target Companies to Oxford Companies that comprise the excess of the
Net Intercompany Payable over the Estimated Net Intercompany Payable. To the
extent that the Net Intercompany Payable is less than the Estimated Net
Intercompany Payable, the Parties shall treat Oxford as having paid an amount
of cash equal to such difference as a refund of a portion of the payment
described in Section 1.9(a), and Holdco as having paid an equivalent amount to
Oxford as an adjustment to the Election Consideration. To the extent that the
Net Intercompany Payable would be less than zero if the second sentence of the
definition thereof were ignored, such amount shall be deemed to have been
distributed by the Target Companies to Oxford immediately prior to the Closing
pursuant to the Restructuring Steps Plan.

Section 2.4 _Effect of the Merger on the Cambridge Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the holder of any Cambridge Common Stock, any MergerCo common stock or
any Holdco Common Stock:

 



 

(a) Each issued share of Cambridge Common Stock that is owned by Cambridge (as
a treasury share or otherwise), or by any Subsidiaries of Cambridge
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and

outstanding and automatically cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and
each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (each, a "
_Book Entry Share_ ") previously representing any such Cambridge Common Stock
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Cambridge shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Cambridge Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Book Entry Shares and Certificates
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any dividend or distribution
payable in accordance with Section 2.5(f), in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.5.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Surrender and Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the
Effective Time, Cambridge shall select an exchange agent in connection with
the Merger (together with any agent also selected, the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of
Cambridge Common Stock the shares of Holdco Common Stock that such holder
shall become entitled to receive with respect to such holders shares of
Cambridge Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4. The Exchange Agent shall act
as agent for each holder of shares of Cambridge Common Stock in connection
therewith.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each holder of record of Cambridge Common Stock that are
represented by Book Entry Shares or Certificates, a letter of transmittal in
customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Book Entry Shares or Certificates held by such holder
representing such shares of Cambridge Common Stock shall pass, only upon
actual and proper delivery of Book Entry Shares or Certificates to the
Exchange Agent.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall procure the deposit with,
or otherwise make or cause to be made available to, the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Cambridge Common Stock, that number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock that is sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4. In addition, Holdco shall make
available by depositing (or causing to be deposited) cash, shares or other

 



      
 

 



 

property with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time, sufficient to pay any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.5(f) (the Holdco Common Stock to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent, together with any cash, shares or other property necessary to
pay any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(f) the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(d) Each holder of shares of Cambridge Common Stock that are represented by
Book Entry Shares or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
such holders shares of Cambridge Common Stock that are represented by Book
Entry Shares or Certificates, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Book
Entry Share or Certificate, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions (i)
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such holders shares of
Cambridge Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Book
Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with Section 2.4 and (ii) any cash
dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.5(f), and Book Entry Shares or Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled, and Holdcos register of members
shall be updated accordingly. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of shares of Cambridge Common Stock.

 



 

(e) If delivery of shares of Holdco Common Stock in respect of shares of
Cambridge Common Stock represented by a Book Entry Share or Certificate is
directed by the Person in whose name the surrendered Book Entry Share or
Certificate is registered to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Book Entry Share or Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of delivery that the Book Entry Share or Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer. Until so surrendered, each Book Entry Share and Certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.5 but shall not entitle
its holder or any other Person to any rights as a stockholder of Holdco or
Cambridge.

 



 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco Common Stock
deliverable with respect to the shares of Cambridge Common Stock shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Book Entry Shares or Certificates until
after those Book Entry Shares or Certificates are surrendered as provided in
this Section 2.5. After surrender, there shall be delivered and/or paid to the
holder of the Holdco Common Stock delivered in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to those shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date
on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
those shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable shares of Holdco Common Stock deliverable, and the
dividends or other distributions payable, in respect of the shares of
Cambridge Common Stock represented by the Certificate pursuant to Section 2.4.

 



 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited by Cambridge and/or
Holdco in the Exchange Fund for the purpose of paying dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(f), pending its disbursement to the
relevant shareholders, in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest. Holdco shall be responsible for any losses of such
cash and shall deposit additional cash with the Exchange Agent as may be
required from time to time in order for the Exchange Agent to make the
payments required by this Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Cambridge Common Stock on the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (including all interest
and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect to all funds made
available to it) shall be delivered to Holdco upon demand. Any holders of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.5 shall thereafter look only to Holdco (subject to abandoned
property, escheat, unclaimed money or similar Laws) with respect to the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.5(f). None of Holdco, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Holdco Common Stock, cash
or other property delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

Section 2.6 _No Appraisal Rights_. There are no appraisal rights available to
holders of Cambridge Common Stock under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Effect of the Merger on Cambridge Stock Options and Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each option to purchase Cambridge Common Stock (a " _Cambridge Stock
Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of Cambridge
(the " _Cambridge Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a current or former employee, director or
consultant of Cambridge shall become vested in accordance with the terms of
the Cambridge Stock Plans, the award agreement pursuant to which each such
Cambridge Stock Option was granted and any other agreement between the holder
of any such Cambridge Stock Option and Cambridge and at the Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right to acquire Cambridge Common Stock and shall
be converted, at the Effective Time, into a stock option to acquire shares of
Holdco Common Stock (a " _Holdco Stock Option_ ") on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Cambridge Stock Option. The
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to each such Holdco Stock
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Cambridge Common Stock
subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
Holdco Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of Cambridge Common
Stock of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each award of restricted Cambridge Common Stock granted under a Cambridge
Stock Plan that is outstanding and unvested or otherwise subject to forfeiture
or other restrictions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Cambridge Restricted Shares_ ") shall become vested in accordance with the
terms of the Cambridge Stock Plans, the award agreement pursuant to which each
such Cambridge Restricted Share was granted and any other agreement between
the holder of any such Cambridge Restricted Shares and Cambridge at the
Effective Time and shall be treated in a manner consistent with Section 2.4.

 



 

(c) Each award of restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units,
performance shares, phantom shares or other similar rights or awards (an "
_Equity Right_ ") granted under a Cambridge Stock Plan and relating to shares
of Cambridge Common Stock (any such award a " _Cambridge Equity Right_ " and
such awards together with the Cambridge Stock Options and the Cambridge
Restricted Shares, the " _Cambridge Stock Awards_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested in accordance with
the terms of the Cambridge Stock Plans, the award agreement pursuant to which
each such Cambridge Equity Right was granted and any other agreement between
the holder of any such Cambridge Equity Right and Cambridge and shall be
settled immediately prior to the Effective Time and the shares delivered shall
be exchanged as provided in Section 2.4(c); _provided_ that any shares of
Holdco Common Stock issuable in connection with the vesting of any Cambridge
Equity Rights that are restricted stock units will be issued in accordance
with the terms of the award agreements pursuant to which such restricted stock
units were granted or at such time or times as necessary to ensure that no
additional Tax will be imposed under Section 409A of the Code, and at the
Effective Time each Cambridge Equity Right shall cease to relate to or
represent a right to receive shares of Cambridge Common Stock and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into an Equity Right relating to Holdco
Common Stock (a " _Holdco Equity Right_ ") of the same type and on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Cambridge Equity
Right, except as adjusted hereby. The number of shares of Holdco Common Stock
covered by each such Holdco Equity Right shall be equal to the number of
shares of Cambridge Common Stock subject to the Cambridge Equity Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time. All dividend equivalents credited to
the account of each holder of a Cambridge Equity Right as of the Effective
Time shall remain credited to such holders account immediately following the
Effective Time, subject to adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.

 



 

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver to
the holders of Cambridge Stock Awards appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the respective Cambridge Stock Awards and stating
that such Cambridge Stock Awards and the agreements relating thereto have been
assumed by Holdco and shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.7 after
giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Cambridge Stock Plans).

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Cambridge shall take all necessary action for
the adjustment of Cambridge Stock Awards under this Section 2.7; _provided_
that such actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions and shall be of no effect if this Agreement
is terminated; and, _provided further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.7 or otherwise in this Agreement, any assumption,
adjustment or other treatment of the Cambridge Stock Awards, as contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

under this Section 2.7 shall be performed in a manner that is in compliance
with the adjustment requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and
in compliance with all other applicable requirements of Section 409A of the
Code such that no Tax or penalty under Section 409A shall result from such
assumption, adjustment or other treatment contemplated under this Section 2.7.
Holdco shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock at
least equal to the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock that will be
subject to Holdco Stock Options and Holdco Equity Rights as a result of the
actions contemplated by this Section 2.7.

 



 

(f) At the Effective Time, if Holdco determines that it desires to do so,
Holdco may assume any or all of the Cambridge Stock Plans. If Holdco elects to
so assume any Cambridge Stock Plan, then under such Cambridge Stock Plan
Holdco will be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under
applicable Laws, using the share reserves of such Cambridge Stock Plan as of
the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a
result of the termination or forfeiture of a Holdco Equity Right that is
issued or granted in substitution of a Cambridge Stock Award pursuant to this
Section 2.7), except that, following the Effective Time: (i) shares covered by
such Cambridge Stock Plan will be shares of Holdco Common Stock; (ii) all
references in such Cambridge Stock Plan to a number of shares will be deemed
amended to refer instead to that number of shares of Holdco Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share); and (iii) the Holdco Board or a
committee thereof will succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Cambridge Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of
such Cambridge Stock Plan.

 



 

(g) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Holdco shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to the Holdco Common Stock subject to Holdco Equity Rights
held by individuals who are employees or consultants of Holdco and its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) If, as a result of the Transactions, an excise Tax is imposed under
section 4985 of the Code on any equity awards granted prior to the date hereof
to the officers or directors of any of the parties hereto, Holdco, or one of
its Affiliates, shall indemnify such Persons for any such excise Tax
obligation with respect to such equity awards (including any such excise Tax
on such indemnification amounts) so that, with respect to such equity awards,
they would be in the same position as if no such excise Tax had been applied,
on a net after tax basis.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Holdco, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash, Holdco Common Stock or other
property otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (other than pursuant to
Article VIII or Article IX) any amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of any payment under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Holdco, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 **RESTRUCTURING; HOLDCO MATTERS; CLOSING**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Restructuring_. To facilitate the Transactions, from the date of
this Agreement until and including the Closing Date, the Parties shall

Letter (such steps plan, the " _Restructuring Steps Plan_ " and the steps
outlined therein, the " _Restructuring_ ") prior to the Closing, with such
changes to the Restructuring Steps Plan as may be approved by each of Oxford

delayed.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Holdco Matters_.

 



 

(a) Within twenty-seven (27) days prior to the Effective Time, Holdco will re-
register as a public company limited by shares named "CF plc" (or such other
name as Cambridge may select at its sole discretion) (the date of such re-
registration, the " _Re-Registration Date_ "). From the Re-Registration Date
until the Effective Time, the Holdco Board shall consist of three (3)
directors, each of which shall be designated by Oxford. On the Closing Date,
immediately following the Effective Time, the articles of association of
Holdco shall be amended and restated in their entirety and adopted

pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as Additional Share Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.2(b), Distributable Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3 or as
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4 and any other Holdco Common Stock
the issuance of which is contemplated by this Agreement and/or to place any
such Holdco Common Stock into one or more clearance systems or any combination
of the above. In this Agreement, any reference to Base Share Consideration,
Additional Share Consideration, Merger Consideration, Share Consideration or
Holdco Common Stock shall be treated as including, where the context requires,
any interest in any such custodian or clearance system which represents any
Holdco Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Holdco
shall be entitled to deliver such book-entry or other interests as Base Share
Consideration, Additional Share Consideration, Election Consideration,
Election Shares, Distributable Consideration, Merger Consideration and Share
Consideration. Cambridge shall use commercially reasonable efforts such that
the foregoing arrangements implemented with respect to the Merger
Consideration shall also be implemented with respect to the Distributable

Closing to facilitate the transfer of any Retained Shares into the foregoing
arrangements as, if and when such shares may be so transferred.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Closing_.

Section 4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_.

 



 

(a) Oxford and each Oxford Company party to any Oxford Transaction Agreement
is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar
concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and any other jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or, where relevant, in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate (i) has not had an Oxford Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Transactions. Oxford and each Oxford Company party to any
Oxford Transaction Agreement has all requisite corporate or similar
organizational power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business, except where the failure to have such
power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, (i) has not had an
Oxford Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Each of the Target Companies is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and duly qualified to do business and, to the
extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction,
is in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and any
other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by
it therein or in which the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or, where relevant,
in good standing, individually or in

the Oxford Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution
and delivery of, and the performance of each of their respective obligations
under, the Oxford Transaction Agreements entered into by such Person, and the
consummation by Oxford and each Oxford Company party to any Oxford Transaction
Agreement of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate or similar organizational action on behalf of Oxford or the
applicable Oxford Company, other than the receipt of the Oxford Stockholder
Approval. Assuming each Oxford Transaction Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of the other parties thereto, each Oxford
Transaction Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
Oxford and each Oxford Company party to such Oxford Transaction Agreement,

action or event would be required to cause such payment or benefit to be
triggered and (ii) the execution of, and performance of the Transactions as

severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of Indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligations to fund benefits

renewals have been timely applied for, except as has not had, individually or
in the aggregate, an Oxford Material Adverse Effect. No Governmental Body has

clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens, (ii) each Oxford Real Property
Lease is in full force and effect, (iii) each Oxford Real Property Lease is a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the applicable Target Company
and, to the knowledge of Oxford, the other parties thereto, subject in each
instance to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to creditors rights
and general principles of equity, except as has not had an Oxford Material
Adverse Effect and (iv) no Target Company has received or given any written
notice of any material default or is in material breach of any Oxford Real
Property Lease and, to the knowledge of Oxford, no counterparty to any Oxford
Real Property Lease is in material breach thereof.

 



 

(e) Section 4.21(e) of the Oxford Disclosure Letter lists and correctly
describes all real property with respect to which a Target Company holds a
right of first option, right to purchase or other similar right as of the date
hereof (each, an " _Oxford Purchase Option_ ") and lists the counterparty to
such agreement and the address of such property. A true, correct and complete
copy of each Oxford Purchase Option has been made available to Cambridge.

 



 

(f) To the knowledge of Oxford, the Oxford Owned Real Property (i) has access
to and from public highways, streets and roads and there is no proceeding
pending or, to

case, such failure, has not had, individually or in the aggregate, an Oxford
Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending proceeding of which Oxford has

to take all or any portion of the Oxford Owned Real Property or any interest
therein or portion thereof by eminent domain or any condemnation proceeding

disposition in lieu thereof. The use or occupancy of the Oxford Owned Real
Property (or any portion thereof) or the conduct of the Business thereon is
not dependent on a "permitted non-conforming use" or "permitted non-conforming
structure" or similar variance, exemption or approval from any Governmental
Body.

employees who have a significant role in Oxfords internal controls or those
of the Target Companies.

 



 

Section 4.23 _Solvency_. Oxford is not insolvent and will not be rendered
insolvent as a result of the Transactions. For purposes hereof, the term
"Oxford" refers to Oxford and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, and

is in excess of the total amount of Oxfords liabilities (including for
purposes of this definition a reasonable estimate of contingent liabilities);
(b) Oxford is able to pay its debts and obligations in the ordinary course as

Section 4.24 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Oxford expressly for inclusion in (i) the Proxy Statement or Form
S-4 (including any amendments thereto), at the date first mailed to each of
Cambridges stockholders or at the time of the Cambridge Stockholder Meeting
or, in the case of the Form S-4, when the Form S-4 goes effective under the
Securities Act, and (ii) any other document (including any amendments thereto)

any material fact required to be stated therein or

 



      
 

 



 

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Oxford makes no representation or warranty with respect to
information or statements provided by or on behalf of Cambridge, Holdco, or
their Representatives for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, Form S-4 or any
other document (including any amendments thereto) filed by Cambridge with the
SEC (or included in any financing document).

any Oxford Transaction Agreement or as otherwise contemplated by or provided
in this Agreement, the Firewater One Shareholder Agreement or the Holdco
Shareholder Agreement:

(excluding any interest created solely by the record or beneficial ownership

Section 4.26 _Investment Intent_. Oxford is an "accredited investor" within
the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act. Oxford is
acquiring the Retained Shares solely for its own account for investment
purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Oxford acknowledges that the Retained Shares are not
registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and that
the Retained Shares may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the
registration provisions of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom and subject to state securities laws and regulations, as
applicable. Oxford is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Retained
Shares for an indefinite period (including total loss of its investment) in
violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

of the Transactions shall not give rise to, an Event of Default (as defined in
the Conditions) or material breach of the Conditions or the Convertible Bond
Trust Deed or any event or circumstance that, with notice or the passage of
time, would constitute such an Event of Default or material breach of the
Conditions or the Convertible Bond Trust Deed.

 



 

Section 4.29 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV or in any certificates delivered by
Oxford in connection with the Closing, Cambridge and Holdco acknowledge that
neither Oxford nor any Person on behalf of Oxford makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Oxford, the Business or the
Target Companies or with respect to any other information provided or made
available to Cambridge in connection with the Transactions, including
information conveyed at management presentations, in the Data Room, or in due
diligence sessions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CAMBRIDGE**

 



 

Except (i) other than with respect to Section 5.1, Section 5.2, Section 5.3,
Section 5.5 and Section 5.6, as disclosed in the publicly available Cambridge
Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (but, in each
case, excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) and any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer)
or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Oxford by Cambridge
at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Cambridge Disclosure
Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular section or subsection of
this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ that any
information set forth in one section or subsection of the Cambridge Disclosure
Letter shall also be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face), Cambridge
represents and warrants to Oxford that:

 



 

Section 5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Cambridge is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the Laws of Delaware and any other
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified or, where relevant, in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate (i) has not had a Cambridge
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Cambridge
has all requisite corporate or similar organizational power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) has not had a Cambridge Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Cambridge has
the requisite corporate or similar organizational power and authority to
execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, each of the Cambridge
Transaction Agreements entered into by Cambridge and, upon receipt of the
Cambridge Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution
and delivery of, and the performance by Cambridge of obligations under, the
Cambridge Transaction Agreements, and the consummation by Cambridge of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate or similar
organizational action on behalf of Cambridge, other than the receipt of the
Cambridge Stockholder Approval. Assuming each Cambridge Transaction Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the other parties
thereto, each Cambridge Transaction Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of Cambridge, enforceable against Cambridge in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally and general principles of equity.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized Capital Stock of Cambridge consists of five hundred million
(500,000,000) shares of Cambridge Common Stock and fifty million (50,000,000)
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Cambridge Preferred
Stock_ "). As of July 31, 2015 (the " _Cut-Off Time_ "), there were (i) two
hundred thirty three million forty seven thousand seven hundred eighty five

including shares held in treasury), (ii) thirteen million one hundred forty
four thousand four hundred eighty six (13,144,486) shares of Cambridge Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon either the exercise of outstanding Cambridge
Stock Options or the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of

nine hundred thirty (2,393,930) shares of Cambridge Common Stock were held in

outstanding. From the Cut-Off Time to the date of this Agreement, no
additional shares of Cambridge Common Stock have been issued (other than
pursuant to Cambridge Stock Options and Cambridge Equity Rights which were
outstanding as of the Cut-Off Time and are included in the number of shares of
Cambridge Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding
Cambridge Stock Options or the vesting of Cambridge Equity Rights in (ii)
above), no additional Cambridge Stock Options or Cambridge Equity Rights have
been issued or granted, and there has been no increase in the number of shares
of Cambridge Common Stock subject to the Cambridge Stock Options or the
Cambridge Equity Rights from those subject to Cambridge Stock Options and
Cambridge Equity Rights as of the Cut-Off Time. All such issued and
outstanding shares of Cambridge Common Stock are, and all shares that may be
issued pursuant to the Cambridge Stock Plans will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding shares of
Capital Stock which, and there are no options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock units, phantom awards, performance awards, other compensatory
equity-based awards, warrants, conversion rights, calls, subscriptions,
convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments which, in
either case, obligate Cambridge to issue transfer, sell or register any

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Capital Stock of Cambridge or any of its Subsidiaries. Cambridge has
no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations, the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Cambridge on any
matter.

 



 

Section 5.4 _No Conflict_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by Cambridge of the Cambridge
Transaction Agreements, the compliance by Cambridge with all of the provisions
of and the performance by Cambridge of its obligations under the Cambridge
Transaction Agreements nor, subject to the filings and other matters referred
to in Section 5.4(b) the consummation of the Transactions by Cambridge in
accordance with the terms thereof will: (i) subject to receipt of the
Cambridge Stockholder Approval, conflict with or result in a breach of any
provisions of the Charter Documents of Cambridge; (ii) violate, or conflict
with, or result in a breach of any provision of, result in any acceleration of
any rights or obligations under, constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or
otherwise result in creation of a Lien or other detriment to Cambridge under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit,
lease, Contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which Cambridge or any Cambridge Subsidiary is a party, or by which Cambridge
or any Cambridge Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound or affected; or (iii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a
violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to Cambridge
or any of their respective properties or assets, except as, in the case of
matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate,
(i) has not had a Cambridge Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by Cambridge of the Cambridge
Transaction Agreements, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and
the performance by Cambridge of its obligations under the Cambridge
Transaction Agreements to which Cambridge is a party, nor the consummation of
the Transactions by Cambridge in accordance with the terms thereof, will
require any Governmental Approvals other than the Regulatory Filings and (i)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger and any other related subsequent
filings with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the DGCL and the DLLCA; (ii) the filings with the SEC of (A) the Proxy
Statement in accordance with Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, (B) the Form S-4 and (C) such reports under and such other compliance
with the Exchange Act and the Securities Act as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions; and (iii) any registration, filing
or notification required pursuant to state securities or "blue sky" laws
except where the failure to make or obtain such Governmental Approvals,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) has not had a Cambridge Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Except for the consents,
approvals and notices listed in Section 5.4(b) of the Cambridge Disclosure
Letter and the Governmental Approvals set forth in the preceding sentence,
neither the execution and delivery by Cambridge of the Cambridge Transaction
Agreements, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and the
performance by its obligations under the Cambridge Transaction Agreements, nor
the consummation of the Transactions by Cambridge in accordance with the terms
thereof will

 



      
 

 



 

require any consent or approval of or notice to any Governmental Body, except
where the failure to obtain any such consent or approval or provide any such
notice, individually or in the aggregate, (i) has not had an Oxford Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Board Approval_. The Cambridge Board, at a meeting duly called
and held, (a) determined that the Cambridge Transaction Agreements and the
Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of
Cambridge, (b) approved the Cambridge Transaction Agreements and the
Transactions and (c) resolved to recommend that its stockholders approve the
Merger and adopt the Agreement (the " _Cambridge Board Recommendation_ "). The
Cambridge Board has received the opinions of Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC and
Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the " _Cambridge Financial Advisors_ "), dated August 5,
2015, substantially to the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations set forth therein, the
Consideration (as defined in such opinions) to be paid for the Purchased
Equity Interests is fair, from a financial point of view, to Cambridge.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Vote Required_. The only votes of the holders of any class or
series of Capital Stock of Cambridge necessary to approve the Transactions are
(a) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Cambridge Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and (b) the occurrence of the stockholder advisory vote contemplated
by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, regardless of the outcome of such
vote, in each case in accordance with the Cambridge Certificate, the Cambridge
Bylaws, the DGCL, the NYSE Listed Company Manual and other Laws, as applicable
(the " _Cambridge Stockholder Approval_ ").

 



 

Section 5.7 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Cambridge and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all documents
(including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required to be so filed by
them since January 1, 2013, pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Cambridge Reports_ "). As of its respective
date, each Cambridge Report (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except for any statements in any Cambridge Report that have been
modified by an amendment to such report filed with the SEC prior to the date
of this Agreement. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Cambridge Reports (including related notes
and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Cambridge and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the Cambridge Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may
be, of Cambridge and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (the " _Cambridge Financial Statements_ ") (subject, in

 



      
 

 



 

the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal, year-end audit adjustments and to any
other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto), in each
case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.

 



 

(b) Cambridge has heretofore furnished to Oxford true and correct copies of
all comment letters from the SEC since January 1, 2013, through the date of
this Agreement with respect to any of the Cambridge Reports, together with all
written responses thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to the Cambridge Reports, and, to the knowledge of
Cambridge, none of the Cambridge Reports are subject to ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) Cambridge maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed to provide
reasonable assurance to Cambridge regarding the reliability of Cambridges
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in conformity with GAAP. Cambridge has evaluated the effectiveness of
Cambridges internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Cambridge Report that
is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Cambridge has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
to Cambridges auditors and the audit committee (A) all "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Cambridges ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Cambridges internal control over financial reporting, and each such
deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Oxford prior to the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standard No.
5, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Cambridge maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Cambridge in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Cambridges
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Cambridge required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. To the knowledge of
Cambridge, as of the date of this Agreement, Cambridge and Cambridges
Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations (whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be reflected on the
consolidated balance sheet of Cambridge and Cambridges Subsidiaries, except

in all material respects. All Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return)
required to be paid by Cambridge and the Cambridge Subsidiaries have been
timely paid.

respects with all applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and

in writing as a result of any examinations by any Tax Authority of Tax Returns
of Cambridge and the Cambridge Subsidiaries have been fully paid, and no other

any Tax Returns of Cambridge or any Cambridge Subsidiary are in progress with
respect to which Cambridge or any Cambridge Subsidiary has received written
notice from a Tax Authority.

 



 

(d) There are no Liens for Taxes on the equity interests in any Cambridge
Subsidiary or any of the assets of Cambridge and the Cambridge Subsidiaries,
other than Permitted Liens.

 



 

(e) Cambridge and the Cambridge Subsidiaries have not engaged in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

Oxfords stockholders or at the time of the Oxford Stockholder Meeting, (ii)

such filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cambridge makes no
representation or warranty with respect to information or statements provided
by or on behalf of Oxford or its Representatives for inclusion in the Oxford
Notice (including any amendments thereto).

 



 

Section 5.12 _Financing_. Cambridge has delivered to Oxford (i) a correct and
complete fully executed copy of the commitment letter, dated as of August 6,
2015, between Cambridge and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Goldman
Sachs Bank USA, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to
such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Commitment
Letter_ ") and (ii) a correct and complete fully executed copy of the fee
letter referenced in the Commitment Letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ") (it being
understood that such letter has been redacted to omit the fee amounts and
market flex provisions therein and that the provisions redacted would not
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the principal amount or
availability of the debt financing being made available by the Financing
Sources under the Commitment Letter for the purpose of financing the
Transactions). Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the
Commitment Letter, each of the parties thereto (other than Cambridge) has
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of certain of
such funds designated in the Commitment Letter for the purpose of financing
the Transactions, but subject to the provisions of Sections 7.16 (a) and (b),
the " _Debt Financing_ ," and collectively with all other commitments under
the Commitment Letter, and any private or capital markets debt financing
undertaken in replacement of all or any portion of any of the foregoing, the "
_Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Commitment Letter. Neither
the Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter has been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in
any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Cambridge, and to the
knowledge of Cambridge, each of the other parties thereto, and enforceable
against Cambridge, and, to the knowledge of Cambridge, each of the other
parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of
equity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing pursuant to
the Commitment Letter, and there are no, and there are not contemplated to be
any, agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to (x) the conditions
precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing or (y) any
reduction of the amount of the Debt Financing, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default) or prevent a condition precedent from being satisfied, in each case
on the part of Cambridge, or, to its knowledge, any other parties thereto,
under the Commitment Letter (assuming, for such purpose, the accuracy of
Oxfords Acquisition Agreement Representations (as defined in the Commitment
Letter on the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof) and the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent under
Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 (other than those that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions)). As of the date of this Agreement, assuming, for such purpose,
the accuracy of Oxfords Acquisition Agreement Representations (as defined in
the Commitment Letter on the date hereof) and the satisfaction or waiver of
all conditions precedent under Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 (other than those
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), Cambridge does not have any
reason to believe that (I) any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will
not be satisfied, or (II) the Debt Financing will not be available to
Cambridge on the Closing Date. Cambridge has fully paid all commitment fees or
other fees to the extent required to be paid on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Solvency_. Cambridge is not insolvent and will not be rendered
insolvent as a result of the Transactions (giving effect to the Financing and
payment of all related fees and expenses). For purposes hereof, the term
"Cambridge" refers to Cambridge and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
and the term "solvency" means that: (a) the fair salable value of Cambridges
assets is in excess of the total amount of Cambridges liabilities (including
for purposes of this definition a reasonable estimate of contingent
liabilities); (b) Cambridge is able to pay its debts and obligations in the
ordinary course as they mature; and (c) immediately after the Closing,
Cambridge will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on
its business.

with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Cambridge.

action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the

involving any Cambridge Benefit Plan and no suit, action or other litigation
(excluding routine claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of
Cambridge Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to
any Cambridge Benefit Plans, in each case, except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability; and all contributions, premiums
and other payments required to have been made with respect to the Cambridge
Benefit Plans have been timely made or provided for or accrued in accordance
with GAAP.

 



 

(b) (i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions shall cause any payments or benefits to any current or former
employee, officer or director of Cambridge to either be subject to an excise
Tax or to be non-deductible under Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code,
respectively, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be
required to cause such payment or benefit to be triggered; and (ii) the
execution of and performance of the Transactions as contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
subsequent event) constitute an event under any Benefit Plan, policy,
arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan (in connection therewith) that
will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligations to fund benefits with respect to any Cambridge
Affected Employee.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and the

respective Representatives, receives a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal for Oxford from any Person that did not result from
Oxfords, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives
knowing or intentional breach of this Section 7.4, and if the Oxford Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal for Oxford and that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then Oxford, its Subsidiaries and its

shall not (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize

adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of Oxford, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of Oxford, an Acquisition Proposal
for Oxford (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Oxford Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
Oxford or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal

accordance with Section 7.4(c(). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Oxford Stockholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, the Oxford Board may make an Oxford Adverse
Recommendation Change under clause (A) of such definition if and only if, both
(1) solely in response to an Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal for
Oxford and (2) prior to taking such action, the Oxford Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Oxford Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making
such Oxford Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) Oxford has given Cambridge at
least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, (y)
Oxford has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Cambridge during such notice period, to the extent Cambridge
wishes to negotiate, to enable Cambridge to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement such that it would permit the Oxford Board not to make an
Oxford Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 7.4(e) and (z)
upon the end of such notice period, the Oxford Board shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Cambridge, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Oxford Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Section 7.6 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form S-4; Provision of
Oxford Financial Statements; Cambridge and Oxford Stockholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) Cambridge shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file,
subject to receipt of all financial statements and other information required
to be provided by Oxford hereunder, with the SEC (i) a proxy statement
(together with any supplement or amendment thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_
"), which Cambridge shall file with the SEC, relating to the meeting of
Cambridges stockholders to be held for the purpose of obtaining the Cambridge
Stockholder Approval (such meeting, the " _Cambridge Stockholder Meeting_ ")
in accordance and in compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) the Form S-4, which Holdco shall file with the
SEC, and in which the Proxy Statement and Oxford Notice will be included as
prospectuses. Each of the Parties will cooperate in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and Form S-4. Oxford shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable furnish to Cambridge and Holdco in writing, for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement and Form S-4, all information concerning Oxford required under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, to be included in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, as may be
reasonably requested by Cambridge. Cambridge, Holdco and Oxford shall notify
one another promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or for additional information related to the
Proxy Statement or Form S-4 and will promptly supply one another with copies
of all correspondence between Cambridge, Holdco, Oxford or any of their
respective officers, employees, legal advisors or agents, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff or any state securities commission, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or the Transactions. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect

 



      
 

 



 

thereto, Cambridge shall provide Oxford with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or proposed response or compliance with
any such request. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement or Form S-4 shall be made by Cambridge or Holdco without first
providing Oxford a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and
considering in good faith any such comments from Oxford. If at any time prior
to the Closing, any information relating to Cambridge or Oxford or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
Cambridge or Oxford which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or Form S-4, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly prepared, filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Cambridge, in each case to the extent
required by applicable Laws. Each of the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after its filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions. The applicable Party shall advise the other Parties promptly
after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of the
shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction. After all the comments received from the
SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all information required to be
contained in the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 has been included therein by
Cambridge and Holdco, if applicable, Cambridge shall promptly file the
definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as
practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of the record date established
by the Cambridge Board pursuant to Section 7.6(d) and set forth in the Proxy
Statement. In addition to the foregoing, the Parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in a jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required
to be taken under any applicable state or provincial securities Laws in
connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of Holdco Common Stock
in the Merger. Cambridge shall be solely responsible for all filing fees and
printing and mailing expenses incurred by or on behalf of Cambridge and Holdco
in connection with the Proxy Statement, Form S-4 and the Cambridge Stockholder
Meeting.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6(c) or Section 7.14(b), Oxford
shall furnish to Cambridge and Holdco all information concerning it, the
Business, its Affiliates and the Target Companies (including a description of
the Business, customary managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations, a discussion of quantitative and
qualitative disclosures of market risk and the information necessary for
Cambridge and Holdco to prepare any required pro forma financial statements)
as may be reasonably requested and as required by the applicable rules of the
SEC and other Laws, and such other information as the SEC or any other
Governmental Body may reasonably request or require, in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form S-4. All information supplied by
or on behalf of Oxford for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement and Form S-4 will

 



      
 

 



 

comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Oxford shall deliver to Cambridge and Holdco:

 



 

(i) on or before November 30, 2015 or, if available prior to such date, when
they become available, audited combined balance sheets of the Target Companies
as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013;

 



 

(ii) on or before November 30, 2015 or, if available prior to such date, when
they become available, audited combined statements of income and cash flows of
the Target Companies for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31,
2013 and unaudited combined statements of income and cash flows of the Target
Companies for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the audited financial
statements in this Section 7.6(c)(i)-(ii), the " _Business Audited Financial
Statements_ ");

 



 

(iii) such interim unaudited financial statements of the Target Companies
required to be included in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include providing interim unaudited financial
statements of the Target Companies as of and for the nine months ending
September 30, 2015 no later than November 30, 2015 or, if available prior to
such date, when they become available (the interim financial statements in
this Section 7.6(c)(iii), the " _Business Interim Financial Statements_ ");
and

 



 

(iv) such other audited and unaudited financial statements of and information
regarding the Business and the Target Companies, to the extent required for
the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, and any reports, attestations or similar
documents by Oxfords auditor to be included in the Proxy Statement and Form
S-4.

 



 

The Business Audited Financial Statements, Business Interim Financial
Statements and the other information provided pursuant to this Section 7.6(c)
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the Form
S-4 is declared effective, subject to Oxfords timely performance of its
obligations set forth in Section 7.6(a) , but subject to Section 7.6(g),
Cambridge shall take all action in accordance with the federal securities
Laws, the DGCL, the Cambridge Certificate and the Cambridge Bylaws necessary
to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Cambridge Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practical for purposes
of seeking the Cambridge Stockholder Approval. Cambridge may adjourn or
postpone the Cambridge

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder Meeting only (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that it determines in good
faith is required by applicable Laws to be disseminated to its stockholders is
so disseminated or (ii) if there are insufficient shares of Cambridge Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Cambridge Stockholder Meeting. Except
as expressly permitted by Section 7.5, Cambridge shall include the Cambridge
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Cambridge Stockholder Approval at the Cambridge
Stockholder Meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, Cambridge shall not be
required to hold the Cambridge Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Article XI.

 



 

(e) Oxford shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare a notice
together with a shareholders circular (together with any supplement or
amendment thereto, the " _Oxford Notice_ ") relating to the meeting of
Oxfords stockholders to be held for the purpose of obtaining the Oxford
Stockholder Approval (such meeting, the " _Oxford Stockholder Meeting_ ") in
accordance and in compliance with Dutch Laws and the Oxford Articles of
Association (including the rules of Euronext Amsterdam). Each of the Parties
will cooperate in the preparation of the Oxford Notice. Prior to mailing the
Oxford Notice (or any amendment or supplement thereto), Oxford shall provide
Cambridge with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Oxford
Notice and all documents attached thereto. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 is declared effective,
but subject to Section 7.6(g), Oxford shall take all action in accordance with
Dutch Laws and the Oxford Articles of Association necessary to establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Oxford
Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practical for purposes of seeking
the Oxford Stockholder Approval. Oxford may postpone the Oxford Stockholder
Meeting only to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or
amendment to the Oxford Notice that it determines in good faith is required by
applicable Laws to be disseminated to its stockholders is so disseminated (it
being understood that, pursuant to Dutch Law, any such postponement may
require Oxford to cancel, establish a new record date for, duly call, give
notice anew of, convene and hold the Oxford Stockholder Meeting). Except as
expressly permitted by Section 7.4, Oxford shall include the Oxford Board
Recommendation in the Oxford Notice and solicit and use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Oxford Stockholder Approval at the Oxford Stockholder
Meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, Oxford shall not be required to hold the
Oxford Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article XI. Oxford shall be solely responsible for all filing
fees and printing and mailing expenses incurred by or on behalf of Oxford in
connection with the Oxford Notice.

 



 

(f) The Parties shall cooperate with and keep one another informed on a
current basis regarding their respective solicitation efforts and voting
results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement or Oxford Notice to
their respective stockholders.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.6, the Parties
will use their respective reasonable best efforts to hold the Oxford
Stockholder Meeting and the Cambridge Stockholder Meeting on the same date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Notification_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the date
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, (i) Cambridge
shall give prompt notice to Oxford of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
change, development, event, occurrence, effect or state of facts whose
occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Section 10.3(a), Section 10.3(b) or
Section 10.3(c) not to be satisfied at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, and (ii) Oxford shall give prompt notice to
Cambridge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any change, development,
event, occurrence, effect or state of facts whose occurrence or non-
occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition set forth in Section 10.2(a), Section 10.2(b) or Section 10.2(c) not
to be satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not in and of itself constitute a violation of this Agreement
(including this Section 7.7) or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the date
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, each Party
shall make available to the other a copy of (i) any written notice or other
written communication received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries from
any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if there is
a reasonable likelihood that the failure to obtain such consent would have a
material impact on such Party or on the timing of the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions, (ii) any written notice or other written
communication between any Governmental Body and such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions and (iii)
any material suits, actions, proceedings or investigations commenced or, to
such Partys knowledge, threatened that relate to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other Transactions. Any Party making available a copy of any document
pursuant to this Section 7.7(b) may redact therefrom such information as
would, in such Partys and its outside legal counsels reasonable judgment,
(i) cause significant competitive harm to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated or disclose references
concerning the valuation of the Transactions, (ii) jeopardize the attorney-
client or other legal privilege of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iii) conflict with any (A) Law applicable to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the business, of such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the its or their assets or
properties are bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such instances such
Party shall when providing the redacted copy of such document
contemporaneously inform the other Party of the general nature of the
information being redacted and, upon the other Partys request, reasonably
cooperate with the other Party to provide such redacted information, in whole
or in part, in a manner that would not cause any such competitive harm
(including by entering in to a "clean team" or similar agreement), jeopardize
any such privilege (including by entering into a common interest or joint
defense agreement) or conflict with any such Law or Contract.

 



 

(c) No notification or making available of information contemplated by this
Section 7.7 shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties,

 



       
 

 



 

the conditions to the obligations of the Parties or the other remedies
available to the Party receiving such notification.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Employee Matters_

 



 

(a) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any individual who is employed
as of the Effective Time by Cambridge and its Subsidiaries or by the Target
Companies and who remains employed by Cambridge and its Subsidiaries or by the
Target Companies (such employees collectively the " _Affected Employees_ ")
first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in
which such Affected Employee did not participate prior to the Effective Time
(the " _New Plans_ "), Holdco shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (subject
to applicable Laws and applicable tax qualification requirements) to: (i)
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such
Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would apply under the analogous Cambridge Benefit Plan or Oxford
Benefit Plan, as the case may be; (ii) provide each Affected Employee and his
or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time under a Cambridge Benefit Plan or Oxford
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Cambridge Benefit Plan or Oxford Benefit Plan, as applicable, prior
to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any New Plans in which such Affected Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time for the same plan year; and
(iii) recognize all service of the Affected Employees with Cambridge and
Oxford and their respective Affiliates for all purposes (including, purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits) in any
New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, including any severance plan, to the extent such service is
taken into account under the applicable New Plan (to the extent recognized
under the corresponding Cambridge Benefit Plan or Oxford Benefit Plan);
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual
under defined benefit plans or to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Effective Time, the terms and conditions of employment for any Affected
Employee whose employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement that
binds Holdco or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall be governed by
such Collective Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or
termination in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 



 

(c) With respect to any individual who is employed as of the Effective Time by
Cambridge and its Subsidiaries or the Target Companies and who becomes an
employee of Holdco or its Subsidiaries or remains an employee of the Target
Companies following the Effective Time, Holdco shall assume in its entirety or
cause its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under, any change in control
severance agreement between such individuals and Cambridge or a Cambridge
Subsidiary.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 7.8(a), no provision of this Section 7.8 shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of Holdco and its Subsidiaries to amend
or terminate any specific Cambridge Benefit Plan or Target Benefit Plan that
Cambridge or Oxford would otherwise have under the terms of such Cambridge
Benefit Plan or Target Benefit Plan, or shall any provision of this Section
7.8 be construed to require the continuation of the employment of any
particular Affected Employee. The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely
for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor or any other Person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 7.8 of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any Oxford Benefit Plan, Cambridge Benefit Plan
or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 



 

(e) Oxford and Cambridge shall consult each other in good faith and in a
reasonably timely manner in advance of any material communications with
Affected Employees or their Representatives regarding the impact of the
Transactions on the Affected Employees, including the impact on Oxford Benefit
Plans or Cambridge Benefit Plans.

 



 

(f) Oxford and Cambridge have taken and/or shall take all steps necessary to
comply with any information or consultation requirements with any labor union,
works council, labor organization or employee representative body regarding
the Transactions prior to the Closing, whether pursuant to any Collective
Bargaining Agreement to which Oxford, Cambridge, any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by or pursuant to applicable Law,
including for the avoidance of doubt the Social and Economic Council Merger
Regulation for the protection of employees ( _SER-Besluit fusiegedragsregels
2000 ter bescherming van de belangen van werknemers_ ) and the Dutch Works
Council Act ( _Wet op de Ondernemingsraden_ ), which require Oxford to inform
and invite certain trade unions for consultation prior to entering into this
agreement and to inform and consult with the Oxford Nitrogen works council
prior to the Closing. If any of the employee representative bodies wishes to
discuss or make their consultation or opinion conditional upon any commitment,
forward-looking statement, condition, obligation, requirement, undertaking or
modification, Oxford and Cambridge shall discuss in good faith whether to
accommodate this. Oxford and Cambridge shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any outstanding issues in this respect and to address any
concerns or conditions of such employee representative bodies, without any
binding obligation to address any concerns or agree on any conditions.

 



 

(g) For a period of one (1) year from and after the Closing Date, Oxford shall
not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates or any of its and
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) cause, induce
or attempt to cause or induce any employee of Holdco and its Subsidiaries or a
Target Company to terminate such relationship; (ii) in any way interfere with
the relationship between Holdco and its Subsidiaries and the Target Companies
and any of their respective employees; or (iii) hire, retain, employ or
otherwise engage or attempt to hire, retain, employ or otherwise engage as an
employee, independent contractor or otherwise, any employee of Holdco and its
Subsidiaries or the Target Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that Oxford
shall not be precluded from hiring, retaining, employing or otherwise engaging
any Person who responds to general or public solicitation not targeted at
employees of Holdco and its Subsidiaries or the Target Companies.

Companies and, during such period, Oxford shall, and shall cause the Target
Companies to, furnish promptly to the other all information concerning the
Business, the Target Companies and their properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested by Cambridge; _provided_ that such access shall not
include any right to conduct environmental sampling or testing at any of the

of information contemplated by this Section 7.9 shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of Oxford
or the Target Companies.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the date
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, Cambridge
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to applicable Laws
relating to the sharing of information and upon reasonable advance notice,
afford Oxfords Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to its personnel, properties, books and records and Contracts and,
during such period, Cambridge shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its and their
businesses, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Oxford;

(c) All information exchanged pursuant to Section 7.9(a) or Section 7.9(b)
shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.9, no
Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any access, or
furnish any information, if doing so would, in such Partys and its outside
legal counsels reasonable judgment, (i) cause significant competitive harm to
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated
or disclose references concerning the valuation of the Transactions, (ii)
jeopardize the attorney-client or other legal privilege of such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with any (A) Law applicable to such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the business,
of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the its or their
assets or properties are bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such
instances such Party shall promptly inform the other Party of the general
nature of the information being withheld and, upon the other Partys request,
reasonably cooperate with the other Party to provide such access or furnish
such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not cause any
such competitive harm (including by entering in to a "clean team" or similar
agreement), jeopardize any such privilege (including by entering into a common
interest or joint defense agreement) or conflict with any such Law or
Contract. No access provided or information furnished pursuant to Section
7.9(a) or Section 7.9(b) shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Parties, the conditions to the

 



      
 

 



 

obligations of the Parties or the other remedies available to the other Party
to which such access was provided or such information was furnished.

 



 

(d) Cambridge and Oxford agree that their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue and remain in effect until the
Closing, upon which such obligations shall expire. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms or, if later, for one (1) years from the date of such
termination.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing, Oxford shall not, and Oxford shall cause the
Oxford Companies and its and their respective Representatives not to, divulge
or convey to any third party or use any Target Confidential Information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Person may furnish such portion (and
only such portion) of Target Confidential Information as such Person
reasonably determines they are legally obligated to disclose if: (i) they
receive a request to disclose all or any part of the Target Confidential
Information under the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order
issued by or for the benefit of a Governmental Body; (ii) to the extent not

recipient notifies Holdco of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such request and consults with Holdco on the advisability of
taking steps available under applicable Laws to resist or narrow such request;
(iii) the recipient discloses only that portion of the Target Confidential
Information as it reasonably determines it is legally obligated to disclose;
and (iv) if so requested by Holdco, the recipient cooperates with Holdco and
otherwise exercises its reasonable best efforts to obtain an order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Target
Confidential Information required to be disclosed pursuant to a subpoena,
civil investigative demand or order. Any cooperation or other exercise of
efforts pursuant to the foregoing clause (iv) shall be undertaken at Holdcos
sole cost and expense.

 



 

(f) From and after the Closing, Holdco shall not, and Holdco shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies and Cambridge) and its and their
respective Representatives not to, divulge or convey to any third party or use
any Oxford Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
Person may furnish such portion (and only such portion) of Oxford Confidential
Information as such Person reasonably determines they are legally obligated to
disclose if: (i) they receive a request to disclose all or any part of the
Oxford Confidential Information under the terms of a subpoena, civil
investigative demand or order issued by or for the benefit of a Governmental
Body; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request and permissible
under applicable Law, the recipient notifies Oxford of the existence, terms
and circumstances surrounding such request and consults with Oxford on the
advisability of taking steps available under applicable Laws to resist or
narrow such request; (iii) the recipient discloses only that portion of the
Oxford Confidential Information as it reasonably determines it is legally
obligated to disclose; and (iv) if so requested by Oxford, the recipient
cooperates with Oxford and otherwise exercises its reasonable best efforts to

be accorded to the Oxford Confidential Information required to be disclosed
pursuant to a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order. Any cooperation
or other exercise of efforts pursuant to the foregoing clause (iv) shall be
undertaken at Oxfords sole cost and expense.

prior to the Closing Date and (ii) afford to Oxford and Oxfords accountants,
counsel and other Representatives reasonable access to inspect and copy during

dispose of or allow the destruction or disposition of any Target Record,
without first having offered in writing to deliver such Target Records to
Oxford. Holdco and the Target Companies (or their respective successors and

corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other books and

Section 7.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions set forth in Section
10.1 and (in the case of Oxford) Section 10.2 or (in the case of Cambridge)
Section 10.3 to be satisfied and to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other Transactions as soon as practicable, including using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of all
Governmental Bodies and officials and parties to Contracts with Cambridge,
Oxford or any of their respective Subsidiaries that may be or become necessary
for the performance of obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the
consummation

 



      
 

 



 

of the Merger and the other Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Oxford, any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates shall have any obligation
to agree to amend or modify any Contract or pay any fees, costs or expenses to
any third party in connection with obtaining any such waivers, permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders. Each Party
shall cooperate and assist one another in good faith (i) in connection with
all actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 7.10(a), including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to herein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information hereunder, and (ii) in seeking,
as promptly as practicable, to obtain all such waivers, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including Section
7.10(b)), each Party agrees to make any filings required to be made pursuant
to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions as promptly as
practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Bodies any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested by such Governmental Bodies pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU
Merger Regulation or such other applicable Antitrust Laws. All such antitrust
filings to be made shall be made in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation and such other
applicable Antitrust Laws, as applicable. All filing fees payable to
Governmental Bodies in connection with the foregoing shall be borne
exclusively by Cambridge, and Cambridge shall promptly reimburse Oxford and
its Affiliates for any such fees paid by such Persons in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

(b) In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the foregoing, the
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with and
assist each other in good faith to (A) determine, as promptly as practicable,
which filings are required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger
Regulation or other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger and
the other Transactions, (B) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
practicable to the other Parties all necessary information and assistance as
any Governmental Body may from time to time require of such Party in
connection with obtaining the relevant waivers, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications, orders or expiration of waiting periods in
relation to such filings or in connection with any other review or
investigation of the Merger and the other Transactions by a Governmental Body
pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable
Antitrust Laws and (C) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
practicable all assistance and cooperation to allow the other Parties to
prepare and submit any such filings or submissions required to be submitted
under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, including providing to the other Parties any information that the other
Parties may from time to time require for the purpose of any filing with,
notification to, application with, or request for further information made by,
any Governmental Body in respect of any such filing and (ii) (A) cooperate
with and assist each other in good faith to devise and implement a joint
strategy for making such filings, including the timing thereof, and for
obtaining any related antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances, (B) consult in advance with the other Parties and in good faith
take the other Parties views into account regarding the overall strategic
direction of obtaining such antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances and (C) consult with the other Parties prior to taking any material
substantive position in any written submissions or, to the extent practicable,
in any discussions with Governmental Bodies with respect to such antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar clearances. Cambridge shall be permitted to
take the lead in all joint meetings and communications with any Governmental
Body in connection with obtaining any necessary

 



      
 

 



 

antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances; _provided_ that
Cambridge shall have complied with its obligations under the other provisions
of this Section 7.10. Each Party shall permit the other Parties to review and
discuss in advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
written arguments, opinions, written proposals or other materials to be
submitted to the Governmental Bodies. Each Party shall keep the other apprised
of the material content and status of any material communications with, and
material communications from, any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and the other Transactions, including promptly notifying the other of any
material communication it receives from any Governmental Body relating to any
review or investigation of the Merger and the other Transactions under the HSR
Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable Antitrust Laws. The Parties
shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide each other with copies of all material, substantive
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Body or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may
be redacted (1) to remove references concerning the valuation of Oxford and
its Subsidiaries or Cambridge and its Subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) as
necessary to comply with any Contract or applicable Laws or orders; and (3) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(c) Cambridge and Oxford shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to obtain approval of the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions by any Antitrust
Authority, including taking all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every legal impediment under any applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted
by any Antitrust Authority or any other Person so as to enable the Parties to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as
practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including proposing,
negotiating, accepting, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of their
Subsidiaries, assets, properties, leases or businesses, the entrance into, or
the amendment, modification or termination of, any Contracts, ownership
rights, supply agreements, tolling agreements or other arrangements, and other
remedies (each a " _Divestiture_ ") in order to obtain such approvals and to
avoid the entry of, and to avoid the commencement of litigation or other legal
proceedings seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other applicable Law in any suit or
other legal proceeding, which could otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions. In addition, Cambridge and Oxford shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, defend through litigation on the merits so
as to enable the Parties to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event prior to the End
Date) any claim asserted in court or an administrative or other tribunal by
any Antitrust Authority or other Person under applicable Antitrust Laws in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other applicable
Law that could prevent or materially delay the Closing from occurring as soon
as practicable; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
litigation shall in no way limit the obligations of the Parties to comply with
their obligations under the terms of this Section 7.10. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, neither Cambridge nor
Oxford nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
required to

 



      
 

 



 

agree to Divestiture if (i) such Divestiture is not conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions or (ii) such Divestiture
would constitute a Burdensome Condition. In the event of any conflict between
Section 7.10(a), Section 7.10(b) or Section 7.10(c), the provisions of this
Section 7.10(c) shall, which respect to the matters addressed in this Section
7.10(c), supersede the provisions of Section 7.10(a) and Section 7.10(b). For
purposes of this Agreement, one or more Divestitures shall constitute a "
_Burdensome Condition_ " if and to the extent such Divestitures would,
individually or in the aggregate with all other Divestitures taken together,
either (i) reasonably be expected to result (after giving effect to any net
after-tax proceeds or other benefits reasonably expected to result from any
such Divestiture) in adverse valuation effects (measured on a net present
value basis) to (A) the business, results of operations or financial condition
of (x) the Target Companies, (y) Cambridge or its Subsidiaries either before
or after giving effect to the Merger and the other Transactions or (z) Holdco
or its Subsidiaries after giving effect to the Merger and the other
Transactions or (B) any anticipated benefits (net of any costs associated with
or relating to such anticipated benefits so affected) reasonably expected to
result to Holdco, Cambridge, the Target Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries from the Merger or the other Transactions, that, in the case of
(A) and (B), individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000,000 or (ii)
require Cambridge, Oxford or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to divest, sell, dispose, assign, license any rights with respect
any property, plant or equipment having a Fair Market Value in excess of
$100,000,000; provided, further, that for purposes of this Agreement, "Fair
Market Value" is based on the value that a willing buyer would pay a willing
seller independent of the Merger or any of the other Transactions.

 



 

(d) Each Party shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to respond as promptly

Section 7.16 _Cambridge Financing_.

 



 

(a) Cambridge shall use its reasonable best efforts (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (except for
replacements thereof not prohibited by this Section 7.16(a) or Section
7.16(b)); (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions in respect thereof) or on other terms
not prohibited by this Section 7.16(a) or Section 7.16(b) or not materially
less favorable, in the aggregate, to Cambridge (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Cambridge) than the terms and conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter, to the extent such definitive agreements are executed
and delivered prior to the Closing, maintain in effect such definitive
agreements; (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Cambridge, seek a waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements within the control of Cambridge and required to be
satisfied by it and otherwise comply in all material respects with all terms
applicable to Cambridge in such definitive agreements; (iv) upon satisfaction
or waiver (by the applicable party that is the beneficiary of such condition
precedent in the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements, as
applicable) of all of the conditions precedent under Section 10.1 and Section
10.2 (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), draw
a sufficient amount of the Debt Financing or any other financing to enable
Cambridge to consummate the Merger, it being understood that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the receipt of the Debt Financing or any other financing by
Cambridge is not a condition to Cambridges obligation to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth herein (subject to the terms of
Article X); and (v) upon satisfaction or waiver (by the applicable party that
is the beneficiary of such condition precedent in the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements, as applicable), of all the conditions precedent under
Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 (other than those that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), enforce the funding obligations rights under the Commitment
Letter or such definitive agreements in the event of a failure to fund by the
Financing Sources that would impede or delay the Closing.

 



 

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter and such portion is
reasonably required to consummate the Transactions, Cambridge shall promptly
notify Oxford and shall use

 



       
 

 



 

its reasonable best efforts to arrange and to obtain from alternative sources
upon terms and conditions (including any market flex provisions) not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Cambridge (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Cambridge) than those contained in the Commitment
Letter (" _Alternative Financing_ "), an amount sufficient, when taken
together with (x) amounts of financing otherwise obtained and available at the
Closing and (y) other financial resources of Cambridge (including its cash on
hand and marketable securities readily convertible into cash, in each case,
that are available at the Closing), to consummate the Merger, it being
understood and agreed that if Cambridge proceeds with any Alternative
Financing, Cambridge shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to
such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term " _Debt
Financing_ " shall be deemed to include any Alternative Financing, and (2) the
term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter
as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in a manner not
prohibited by Section 7.16(a) or this Section 7.16(b), and any commitment
letter with respect to the Alternative Financing. Cambridge shall promptly
deliver to Oxford correct and complete copies of all agreements (redacted to
omit the fee amounts and market flex provisions therein in the event such
agreement is a fee letter) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Cambridge with any portion of such Alternative
Financing. Cambridge shall give Oxford prompt notice of any material breach
(of which Cambridge becomes aware) by any party to the Commitment Letter or of
any termination, waiver, amendment, restatement or other modification of the
Commitment Letter. Cambridge shall keep Oxford reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. Cambridge shall not amend,
restate, waive, or modify, or agree to amend, restate, waive or modify, the
Commitment Letter in any manner that would (A) impose new or additional
conditions precedent, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions
precedent, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (B) reduce the aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing if such
changes would reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing),
below the amount required, taken together with (x) amounts of financing
otherwise obtained and available at the Closing, and (y) other financial
resources of Cambridge (including its cash on hand and marketable securities
readily convertible into cash, in each case, that are available at the
Closing), to consummate the Merger or (C) individually or in the aggregate
with all other such amendments, modifications or waivers, reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the ability of Cambridge to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, or would reasonably be expected
to prevent or impair or delay the ability of Cambridge to consummate the
Transactions, in each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and
(C) without the prior written consent of Oxford; provided, that no consent
from Oxford shall be required for any amendment, restatement, waiver or
modification of the Commitment Letter that (v) is limited to adding or
replacing lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement, (w) implements or exercises any "market flex" or other similar
provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (x) increases the commitments or the amount of indebtedness
thereunder, (y) reduces the commitments or the amount of indebtedness
thereunder not constituting part of the Debt Financing or (z) reduces the
commitments or the amount of indebtedness thereunder by the amount of proceeds
actually received from any private or capital markets debt financing in
replacement thereof and available at the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article XI, Oxford shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including
Holdco if it is a Controlled Affiliate at such time) and the Target Companies
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, provide, on a timely basis, in each case subject to
Cambridges reimbursement and indemnification obligations in this Section
7.16(c) and Section 7.16(d), such reasonable assistance and cooperation as is

in connection with Cambridges obtaining, marketing and arrangement of the

the Commitment Letter (in each case as in effect on the date hereof, or any
similar provisions pursuant to any amendments to the Commitment Letter in a
manner not prohibited by Section 7.16(a) or Section 7.16(b) or pursuant to any
Alternative Financing) (provided that Oxford shall not be required to provide
any audited financial statements for fiscal years prior to 2013), and (B) such
other information regarding the Business, Oxford and the Target Companies as
may be reasonably requested by Cambridge, the Financing Sources or their
respective agents to prepare customary bank information memoranda, lender and

being referred to collectively as the " _Required Information_ ");

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) furnishing Cambridge with documentation and other information reasonably

of documents for Closing, to the extent such information pertains to Oxford,
the Business or the Target Companies;

 



 

(ix) to the extent that Holdco or its Subsidiaries, in each case when a

simultaneously with the Closing, Holdco to Oxford or the applicable borrower;

 



      
 

 



 

(xi) providing authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the

or its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or securities;

 



 

(xii) informing Cambridge if the Oxford Board or a committee thereof, Oxfords

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Oxford, its
controlled Affiliates and the Target Companies (i) shall not be required to
take any action that would require them to incur any other cost or expense
that is not reimbursed promptly by Cambridge pay any commitment or similar
fee, incur any actual or potential liability, or provide or agree to provide

and conditioned on the occurrence of, the Closing. Oxford hereby consents to
the reasonable use of Oxfords, its controlled Affiliates and the Target
Companies trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with the

in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
Oxford or its controlled Affiliates and the Target Companies or the reputation
or goodwill of Oxford or its Affiliates and the Target Companies, and on such
other customary terms and conditions as shall be mutually agreed.

 



 

(d) Cambridge shall from time to time, promptly upon request by Oxford,
reimburse Oxford for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable professional fees and expenses) incurred by Oxford, its

in connection with the Financing, including in connection with this
cooperation of Oxford, its controlled Affiliates and their respective
Representatives contemplated by Section 7.16(c) (other than any cost and

Financing who enter into confidentiality arrangements customary for financing
transactions of the same type as the applicable Financing and (y) on a
confidential basis with rating agencies; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
information may be included in bank information memoranda, lender and investor
presentations, offering memoranda and private placement memoranda (including
under Rule 144A under the Securities Act).

 



 

Section 7.17 _Intercompany Obligations_. Other than pursuant to this Agreement
(including the Restructuring Steps Plan), the Ancillary Agreements and the
intercompany obligations described in Section 7.17 of the Oxford Disclosure
Letter, Oxford shall take such actions as may be necessary so that, as of the
Closing Date, all liabilities, Indebtedness or other obligations owed between
the Business or the Target Companies, on the one hand, and Oxford or any
Related Person, on the other hand, shall be settled, discharged or released in
accordance with the Restructuring Steps Plan, without any remaining liability
of any kind on the part of any Target Company, except to the extent of any
liability that shall be settled pursuant to Section 1.9 of this Agreement and
the Restructuring Steps Plan. Oxford and Cambridge acknowledge and agree (on
behalf of themselves and on behalf of each of their Affiliates) that all
Contracts between the Business or the Target Companies, on the one hand, and
Oxford or any Related Person, on the other hand, other than pursuant to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the intercompany obligations described
in Section 7.17 of the Oxford Disclosure Letter, shall be deemed terminated as

liability of any kind on the part of any Target Company as result of or in
connection with such termination or otherwise, and Oxford and Cambridge shall
cause each of their Affiliates not to take any action or assert any claim that
is inconsistent with such deemed termination.

shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in good faith with Cambridge
with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to the actions set forth on Section 7.18 of the Oxford Disclosure Letter;
_provided_ that neither the failure to complete such actions prior to the

failure of any condition to the Closing set forth in Article X to be
satisfied.

 



 

Section 7.19 _Oxford Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) At Cambridges request, Oxford shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Holdco to permit Holdco to cause IFCO to issue not earlier than the

(b) At the written request of Cambridge at least ten (10) days prior to the

no amounts are then outstanding and, if applicable, that all commitments have
been terminated under such credit facility) from the agents under such credit
facilities in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Cambridge;
_provided that_ the effectiveness of any such documents shall be subject to
delivery of sufficient funds by Cambridge to Oxford or the applicable borrower
to the extent delivery of such funds is required pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.20 _Convertible Bonds_.

 



 

(a) Oxford and Cambridge agree that the Transactions constitute a sale or

terms of Condition 6(m) of the Convertible Bonds and, accordingly, the
provisions of Condition 6(m) of the Convertible Bonds shall be applicable.

 



 

(b) Oxford, Cambridge and Holdco shall take such action as may be necessary to
ensure that at or around the Effective Time: (i) Holdco shall be substituted
in place of Oxford as the issuer of the Convertible Bonds in accordance with
Clause 15.2 of the Convertible Bond Trust Deed; and (ii) the Convertible Bonds
shall become convertible into shares and other securities and property of
Holdco on such basis and with such Conversion Price as may be determined in
good faith by the Convertible Bond Independent Adviser in accordance with
Condition 6(m)(ii) of the Convertible Bonds.

 



 

(c) Oxford, Cambridge and Holdco agree to: (i) comply fully with the terms of
the Convertible Bonds and the Convertible Bond Trust Deed, including giving

relation thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Oxford shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in compliance with applicable Law to make an offer to the
holders of the Convertible Bonds designed to incentivize such holders of
Convertible Bonds to exercise their conversion rights with respect to the
Convertible Bonds prior to the time of the Distribution; _provided_ that such
offer need not be commenced prior to the time that is reasonably proximate to
the anticipated Closing Date. Oxford shall determine the terms of the offer in
good faith, after prior consultation with Cambridge. Oxford shall keep
Cambridge informed in a timely manner of the status of any such offers to
holders of the Convertible Bonds.

 



 

(e) Oxford shall use commercially reasonable efforts to list the Convertible
Bonds prior to the Closing Date on a "recognised stock exchange" within the

(f) Unless Oxford and Cambridge agree in writing on the Convertible Bond
Premium to Parity Value at least 10 day prior to the Closing Date, at least 5
days prior to the Closing Date, each of Oxford and Cambridge shall appoint a
recognized international investment banking firm with experience valuing
convertible bonds, such as the Convertible Bonds (a " _Recognized Investment
Banking Firm_ "), to determine the Convertible Bond Premium to Parity Value.
The Recognized Investment Banking Firms selected by Cambridge and Oxford shall
appoint a third Recognized Investment Banking Firm. If the two Recognized
Investment Banking Firms appointed by Oxford and Cambridge are unable to agree
on a third Recognized Investment Banking Firm, the third Recognized Investment
Banking Firm to be appointed hereunder shall be determined by lot on the 3rd
day prior to Closing from one proposed Recognized Investment Banking Firm
submitted by Oxford (who shall not be the Recognized Investment Banking Firm
selected by Oxford in accordance with this Section 7.20(f)) and one proposed
Recognized Investment Banking Firms submitted by Cambridge (who shall not be
the Recognized Investment Banking Firm selected by Oxford in accordance with
this Section 7.20(f)). Each party will bear the fees and expenses of its own
Recognized Investment Banking Firm, and the fees and expenses of the third
Recognized Investment Banking Firm shall be borne equally by Oxford and
Cambridge.

 



 

(g) As soon as practicable after the Convertible Bond Independent Adviser
shall have completed, and informed Cambridge and Oxford of, the determination
pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 6(m) of the Conditions in connection with
the Transactions and in any event prior one (1) day prior to the Closing Date,
each of the three Recognized Investment Banking Firms appointed hereunder
shall submit its good faith estimate of the Convertible Bond Premium to Parity
Value to Oxford and Cambridge. If the good faith estimate of the Convertible
Bond Premium to Parity Value submitted by the Recognized Investment Banking
Firms appointed by each of Oxford and Cambridge are within 10% of each other,
unless otherwise agreed in writing by Oxford and Cambridge, the Convertible
Bond Premium to Parity Value for purposes of the adjustments contemplated by
Section 1.2 of this Agreement and related definitions shall be the average of
such values. If the good faith estimate of the Convertible Bond Premium to
Parity Value submitted by the Recognized Investment Banking Firms selected by
each of Oxford and Cambridge differ by more than 10%, unless otherwise agreed
by Oxford and Cambridge, the Convertible Bond Premium to Parity Value
submitted by the third Recognized Investment Banking Firm shall be the
Convertible Bond Premium to Parity Value

 



      
 

 



 

for purposes of the adjustments contemplated by Section 1.2 of this Agreement
and related definitions.

 



 

(h) If, at any time after the Closing Date and prior to March 31, 2017, the
Convertible Bonds may be redeemed in accordance with Clause 7(b) of the
Conditions, Holdco shall use commercially reasonable effects to redeem the
Convertible Bonds in accordance with Clause 7(b). If the Convertible Bonds are
called for redemption, on the Optional Redemption Date (as defined in the
Convertible Bond Trust Deed) Holdco shall issue to Oxford (i) the Convertible
Bond Share Reduction Amount _minus_ (ii) the number of shares of Holdco Common
Stock equal to the aggregate amount of interest paid or payable on the
Convertible Bonds after the Closing Date through the Optional Redemption Date
_divided by_ the volume weighted average price per share of Holdco Common
Stock on the NYSE for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending upon and
including the third (3rd) trading day immediately prior to the Optional
Redemption Date as calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function
"VWAP".

 



 

Section 7.21 _Trademark Licenses_. Holdco shall have the right to use the
names and marks set forth in Section 7.21 of the Oxford Disclosure Letter in
connection with the operation of the Business for a period of up to twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date. After such twelve (12)-month period,
Holdco shall discontinue all use of any such names and marks and any
Trademarks related thereto or containing or comprising such names, including
any confusingly similar or dilutive variations thereof (the " _Oxford Marks_
"). In furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Holdco shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, remove, strike over, or otherwise obliterate all
Oxford Marks from all assets and other materials owned by such Person,
including any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites,
email, computer software and other materials and systems. Holdco agrees to
use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use, the Oxford Marks (i) in a form and
manner of that in effect for the Oxford Marks as of the Closing Date or as
otherwise reasonably requested by Oxford and (ii) only with respect to goods
and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of
goods and services with respect to which Oxford used the Oxford Marks prior to
the Closing Date. Any goodwill generated by the use of the Oxford Marks
pursuant to this Section 7.21 shall inure solely to the benefit of Oxford.
Holdco acknowledges that the Oxford Marks are owned exclusively by Oxford, and
it shall have no rights to use thereto after such twelve (12)-month period
following the Closing Date nor challenge Oxfords rights thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdco shall change the legal entity names of
all Target Companies so as not to use any Oxford Marks as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within one (1) month) following the Closing
Date.

 



 

Section 7.22 _Firewater Shareholder Agreement_. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Cambridge and Oxford will work together in
good faith to prepare a mutually agreeable shareholder agreement by and
between Firewater One, Holdco and Oxford consistent with the terms set forth
in the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Firewater One
Shareholder Agreement_ ")

 



 

Section 7.23 _Further Assistance_. From and after the Closing, subject to the
conditions and limitations and upon the terms of this Agreement, each Party
shall use reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with,
applicable Law) to take promptly, or

 



      
 

 



 

cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to carry out the intent and purposes
of this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the conditions
and limitations and upon the terms of this Agreement, each Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the other Parties, shall execute and deliver such
further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the other Parties to
evidence or reflect the Transactions (including the execution and delivery of
all documents, certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary
for all filings hereunder).

 



 

Section 7.24 _Firewater One_. If the conditions set forth in the Firewater One
Term Sheet shall not have been satisfied as of the Closing, Cambridge may by
written notice to Oxford elect that this Agreement be deemed modified such
that: (a) the references to Firewater One in the first recital shall be
deleted and the definition of Purchased Companies shall not include Firewater
One; (b) the fifth recital shall be deleted and the definitions of Cambridge-
Purchased Equity Interest and Purchased Equity Interest shall not include any
Capital Stock of Firewater One; (c) all references to the Natgasoline
Construction Contract shall be deleted; (d) all references to the Natgasoline
Complex shall be deleted; (e) clause (d) in the definition of Business shall
be deleted; (e) Section 1.7, 1.8 and 7.22 shall be deleted in their entirety;
(f) all references to the Firewater One Shareholder Agreement, the Firewater
One Consideration and the Stock Sale shall be deleted; and (g) Sections 1.7
and 1.8 shall be deleted in their entirety.

 



 

Section 7.25 _Directors and Officers Indemnification_. For a period of at
least six (6) years after the Closing Date, Holdco shall not, and shall not
permit any Target Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in any
Target Companys Charter Documents relating to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any individual who
is now, or who has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or
who becomes prior to the Closing, a director or officer of a Target Company,
in connection with acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, on or after the Closing Date
(including in respect of any matters arising in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions), unless, and only to the
extent, required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.26 _Director and Officer Resignations_. To the extent requested by
Cambridge in writing at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing,
Oxford shall (a) obtain and deliver to Cambridge at the Closing duly signed
resignation letters, effective immediately after the Closing, of any directors
and officers (or the equivalents) of the Purchased Companies (other than
Firewater One) and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Cambridge at the Closing duly signed resignation letters, effective
immediately after the Closing, of any directors and officers (or the
equivalents) of any other Target Companies (other than Firewater One and any
of its Subsidiaries).

 



 

Section 7.27 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall, subject to the
preservation of privilege and confidential information, (a) give the other
Parties the opportunity to participate in (but not control) such Partys
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against such Party and/or
its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the

 



       
 

 



 

Merger or the other Transactions and (b) not settle or offer to settle any
such litigation without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 7.28 _State Takeover Statutes_. In the event that any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "supermajority," "affiliate
transactions," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover Law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) becomes applicable to the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, each Party and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger
and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 



 

Section 7.29 _Obligations of Holdco and MergerCo_. Cambridge and Oxford shall
cooperate to cause each of Holdco and MergerCo, as applicable, to perform
those obligations it is required to perform at or prior to the Closing under
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement. Neither Cambridge nor Oxford will
take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause the representations
and warranties of Holdco not to be true and correct in all material respects.
From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the date on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, each of Cambridge
and Oxford shall, and shall cause their respective designees acting as
directors or shareholders of Holdco to, cause Holdco and MergerCo to take all
actions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Restructuring Steps
Plan) to be taken by Holdco and MergerCo and to not take any other action
without the prior written consent of Oxford and Cambridge (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Prior to the Closing, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that Holdco will create one or more additional
Subsidiaries and otherwise take steps to prepare its Subsidiary structure
(including capital structure) for the Transaction. The structure to be in
place as of the Closing shall be determined in good faith by Cambridge, after
prior consultation with Oxford.

 



 

Section 7.30 _Tax Opinions_.

 



 

(a) Each of Holdco and Cambridge shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the 7874 Opinion. Each of Holdco, Cambridge and Oxford shall deliver to
Skadden customary representations and covenants reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to Skadden.

 



 

(b) Each of Holdco and Oxford shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the 355 Opinion. Each of Holdco and Oxford shall deliver to Cleary Gottlieb
Steen and Hamilton LLP (" _Cleary Gottlieb_ ") customary representations and
covenants reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Cleary Gottlieb.

 



 

Section 7.31 _Solvency Opinion_. Oxford shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Solvency Opinion. Oxford shall deliver to Rothschild Inc. ("
_Rothschild_ ") customary representations, warranties and covenants reasonably
satisfactory to Rothschild.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.32 _Transfer Restrictions_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Article VII, Oxford covenants Retained Shares may be disposed of only
pursuant to an effective registration statement under, and in compliance with
the requirements of, the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, and in compliance with any applicable U.S. federal and U.S.
state securities laws. Each share certificate representing Retained Shares
(and any shares of Holdco issued in respect thereof or into which any such
securities shall be converted or exchanged in connection with stock splits,
reverse stock splits, stock dividends or distributions, combinations or
similar recapitalizations, reclassifications or capital reorganizations
occurring after the issuance of the Retained Shares) shall bear the following
legend (and a comparable notation or other arrangement will be made with
respect to any uncertificated shares):

 



 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED. SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF
SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM
THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT.

 



 

In connection with any disposition of any such securities, Oxford agrees that
it will, if requested by Holdco and as a condition to such disposition (other
than a disposition pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act), deliver at its expense to Holdco an opinion of reputable U.S.
counsel selected by Oxford and reasonably acceptable to Holdco, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Holdco and counsel for Holdco, that such
disposition does not require registration under the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 7.33 _Natgasoline Subdivision_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the land on which the Oxford Owned Real Property identified in Section 4.21(a)
of the Oxford Disclosure Letter which is a greenfield methanol production
facility located in Beaumont, Texas known as "Natgasoline LLC" (the "
_Natgasoline Existing Parcel_ ") will be partitioned and subdivided as
determined by the Parties prior to the Closing and in accordance with the
Restructuring Steps Plan, such that ownership of a portion of the Natgasoline
Existing Parcel (the " _Transferred Natgasoline Parcel_ ") will remain vested
in Natgasoline LLC and ownership of the remainder of the Natgasoline Existing
Parcel (the " _Oxford/Cambridge Natgasoline Parcel_ ") will be conveyed by
deed to a new entity of which following the Closing, if Cambridge shall not
have made the election contemplated by Section 7.24, 45% will be owned,
directly or indirectly, by Cambridge and 55% will be owned, directly or
indirectly, by Oxford, such entity contemplated to be named "Natgasoline Land
Holding LLC". The Parties agree that, prior to the Closing and in accordance
with the Restructuring Steps Plan, Oxford shall cause the Natgasoline LLC
entity to take all actions reasonably necessary to complete the partition and
subdivision, including actions necessary to ensure that the Transferred
Natgasoline Parcel and the Oxford/Cambridge Natgasoline Parcel are recognized
as separate real estate parcels and tax lots. Section 7.33 of the Oxford
Disclosure Letter sets forth a depiction of the parties understanding of
those portions of the Natgasoline Existing Parcel which will comprise the

 



      
 

 



 

Transferred Natgasoline Parcel and the Oxford/Cambridge Natgasoline Parcel, it
being understood and agreed that a survey of the Natgasoline Existing Parcel
will be completed to more precisely identify the separate parcels. As part of
such partition and subdivision process, such access and other easements and
rights of way shall be granted as shall be reasonably necessary so that the
newly subdivided parcels can maintain substantially the same uses they
currently support, without any material interruptions to or material adverse
impact on the businesses to be conducted on either such parcel. Oxford shall
be responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with such partition
and subdivision including, the cost of a survey, it being understood that
Oxford has already engaged a surveyor; provided, however, that Cambridge shall
be responsible for the cost of any separate counsel which it engages to advise
it in connection with such partition and subdivision. The Parties agree that
no separate consideration shall be payable by either to the other in
connection with such partition and subdivision, either prior to, at or
following the Closing. To the extent that either Party desires to obtain title
insurance on its subdivided parcel, it may do so at its own sole cost and
expense.

 



 

Section 7.34 _Domain Names_. On or prior to Closing, Oxford shall or shall
cause the registrant of the domain names set forth on Section 7.34 of the
Oxford Disclosure Letter to change the registered owner as recorded by the
applicable registrar of such domain names to a Target Company.

 



 

Section 7.35 _Guarantees_. Holdco and Cambridge each shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure the return or unconditional release of, or cause
Holdco or Cambridge to be substituted in all respects for, any guarantee or
credit support provided by, or any letter of credit, performance bond or
surety posted by, any Oxford Company, in each case effective as of the Closing
Date, which letter of credit, performance bond or surety is solely for the
benefit a Target Company in connection with the Business. If as of the Closing
Date Holdco and Cambridge shall have failed to procure any such return or
release or to have caused any such substitution, then Holdco and Cambridge
shall continue to use such commercially reasonable efforts and, to the extent
the Oxford Companies are not fully and irrevocably released and discharged
therefrom, Holdco shall indemnify and hold harmless the Oxford Companies from
and against, and pay and reimburse the Oxford Companies for, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained the Oxford Companies to the extent arising out of
any such failure, other than any such Losses due to the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any such Oxford Company.

(y) to the extent that such covenants do not have an expiration date,
indefinitely. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any representation and
warranty or covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnification may
hereunder be sought shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences (and the obligation to indemnify
shall not terminate as provided above), with respect to any item as to which,
before the expiration of the applicable period, notice of any claim shall have
been provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Oxford s Indemnity Obligations_. From and after the Closing, and

sentence Section 4.15(a), Section 4.18(a), the first sentence Section 4.19,
Section 4.20(a) and the first sentence Section 4.21(c)) (it being understood
that for purposes of this Section 8.2(a), such representations and warranties

of the Closing Date as though made at the Closing Date (other than
representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of another date,
which shall be deemed to have been made only as of such date));

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment by Oxford, or default by, Oxford under any
agreement or covenant in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Oxford Companies or their respective businesses, operations,
properties or assets, whether before or after the Closing;

 



 

(d) (i) the breach by the Wever Contractor of any of its obligations to
achieve Provisional Acceptance (as defined in the Wever EPC Contract)
(including the Lenders Reliability Test set forth in Section 6.1.2.8 of the
Wever EPC Contract, which is due to occur after Provisional Acceptance, except
to the extent failure to achieve the Lenders Reliability Test is due to
negligence by Cambridge Indemnified Parties), (ii) the breach by the Wever
Contractor of Section 6.5(i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of the Wever EPC Contract,
(iii) the breach by the Wever Contractor of its obligation to indemnify IFCO

(v) any Change Orders (as defined in the Wever EPC Contract) approved by IFCO
prior to the Closing, (vi) any Change Orders under the EPC Contract due to
Contract Price Adjustment Factors (as defined in the Wever EPC Contract), so
long as (A) such Change Order was accepted by IFCO in good faith, (B) approved
by the Independent Engineer (as defined in the Wever EPC Contract) and (C) the
events giving rise to such Change Order occurred prior to the Closing (but
have not been approved by IFCO prior to the Closing) and (vii) any Change
Orders under the Wever EPC Contract due to Time Adjustment Factors that extend
scheduled Provisional Acceptance Date beyond December 31, 2016; _provided_
that Oxford shall not be required to indemnify the Cambridge Indemnified
Parties against or hold any Cambridge Indemnified Parties harmless from any
Losses sustained by the Cambridge Indemnified Parties as a result of any delay
in the timing of the occurrence of the scheduled Provisional Acceptance, as
long as such Provisional Acceptance occurs prior to December 31, 2016,
regardless of whether the events causing such delay occurred before or after
the Closing; and provided further that, in no event shall Oxfords maximum
total liability pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(i), (ii) or (iii) exceed the amount
of liabilities of the Wever Contractor under the respective provisions of the
Wever EPC Contract;

 



 

(e) any claims or any proceedings by or on behalf of any holder of Convertible
Notes relating to, arising out of or in connection with the Transactions,

except to the extent such Losses arise out of or result from a matter for
which indemnification would be provided under Section 8.3 without regard to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.4.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Holdco s and Cambridges Indemnity Obligations_. From and after
the Closing, and subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII,
Holdco and Cambridge shall, jointly and severally, indemnify each Oxford
Indemnified Party against, and hold each Oxford Indemnified Party harmless
from and against, any and all Losses sustained by the Oxford Indemnified
Parties that, directly or indirectly, arise out of or result from:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of
Cambridge in this Agreement (without giving effect to any "materiality" and
"Cambridge Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and exceptions in such
representations and warranties other than those representations and warranties
in Section 5.7 and Section 5.9(b)) (it being understood that for purposes of
this Section 8.3(a), such representations and warranties shall be deemed to
have been made both as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date as though made at the Closing Date (other than representations and
warranties that by their terms speak as of another date, which shall be deemed
to have been made only as of such date));

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment by Cambridge or Holdco of, or default by,
Cambridge or Holdco under any agreement or covenant in this Agreement;

which indemnification would be provided under Section 8.2 without regard to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.4.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(a) No amount of Losses shall be payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) to any
Cambridge Indemnified Party or pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to any Oxford
Indemnified Party, as applicable, unless the aggregate amount of all Losses
that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as
applicable, exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) (the " _Deductible_
"), upon which the aggregate amount of all Losses in excess of such Deductible
shall be recoverable by the Cambridge Indemnified Parties or the Oxford
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof and
subject to the other limitations herein; and _provided_ that the Deductible
shall not apply to any claims for breach of the representations and warranties
in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.11(b), 4.12, 4.27, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.14. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Deductible shall be calculated in the aggregate with
respect to all claims to which the Deductible applies by the Cambridge
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or all claims to which the
Deductible applies by the Oxford Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
8.3(a), as applicable.

 



 

(b) In no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Cambridge
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(a) or for which the Oxford Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) exceed four hundred fifty million
dollars ($450,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ that the Cap shall not
apply to any claims for breach of the representations and warranties in
Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.11(b), 4.12, 4.27, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.14. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall be calculated in the aggregate with respect
to all claims by the Cambridge Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
or all claims by the Oxford Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as
applicable.

 



 

(c) In no event shall the Cambridge Indemnified Parties be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or the Oxford Indemnified Parties
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) for a Loss unless
the claim to which such Loss relates together with any other claims arising
out of the same facts, events or circumstances involves Losses in excess of
five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and if
such claim for Losses does not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such claim for
Losses shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of the Deductible or
Cap; _provided_ that the De Minimis Amount shall not apply to any claims for
breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,
4.11(b), 4.12, 4.27, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.14.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) A Person entitled to indemnity under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give the Person obligated to indemnify under such
section (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, within sixty (60) days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any action or proceeding,
audit, claim, demand or assessment made by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement or one of its Affiliates (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
against it which may give rise to a claim for Losses under this Article VIII,
within sixty (60) days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_
that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its option, to assume
and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if it gives written
notice of its intention to do so (which notice shall constitute the
Indemnifying Partys irrevocable acknowledgment and agreement that such Third
Party Claim is subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party hereunder)
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and
control any such defense against a Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party
may, upon giving prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party, participate
in such defense at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the
claim for indemnification is with respect to a criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation against the Indemnified Party, (ii)
the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that (A) a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party or (B) there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing
to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim or shall have failed to have
engaged counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within the
period of time specified above or (iv) the claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, then (A) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or control the defense of any such claim
or action, and (B) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and
control the defense of such action or claim with counsel of its choosing. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes and controls the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim
unless the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party consents in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party assumes and
controls the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which may be
withheld in the Indemnified Partys sole discretion), enter into any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to such Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)
involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by
the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, or (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party
will be indemnified hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _General_.

 



 

(a) The obligations of Oxford in respect of any claim for Losses under Section
8.2(a) with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.17 shall not become operative and effective to the
extent arising from any conduct by Holdco, Cambridge or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives not consistent with that of a
reasonable and prudent business person who owns the applicable Oxford Real
Property (without consideration of the benefit of any indemnification provided
by Oxford).

 



 

(b) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

 



 

(c) Except (i) in the case of actual fraud, willful misrepresentation or
intentional breach or (ii) with respect to claims for specific performance or
other equitable remedies, from and after the Closing, the remedies set forth
in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies by the Cambridge
Indemnified Parties or the Oxford Indemnified Parties for any inaccuracy of
any representation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement by any of
the Parties contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The indemnification provisions in this Article VIII shall be enforceable
regardless of whether any Person (including the Person from whom
indemnification is sought) alleges or proves the sole, concurrent,
contributory or comparative negligence of the Person seeking indemnification
or the sole or concurrent strict liability imposed upon the Person seeking
indemnification.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall any Indemnifying Party be required to indemnify or hold harmless any
Indemnified Party under this Agreement for any Losses that are punitive,
consequential, special or indirect;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this Section 8.6(e)
shall not apply to any Losses to the extent (i) such Losses (other than
punitive damages) were reasonably foreseeable or (ii) the applicable
Indemnified Party was held liable to a third party for such Losses.

 



 

(f) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
Indemnified Party (net of any expenses incurred in obtaining such proceeds or
payments, including collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium
adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums) in respect of such Losses or
any of the events, conditions, facts or circumstances resulting in or relating
to such Losses (" _Third Party Payments_ "). If an Indemnified Party receives
any Third Party Payment with respect to any Losses for which it has previously
been indemnified (directly or indirectly) by an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days after receiving such Third Party Payment) pay to the Indemnifying Party
an amount equal to such Third Party Payment or, if it is a lesser amount, the
amount of such previously indemnified Losses. The Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under such insurance policies
or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements other than this
Agreement for any Losses to the same extent such Party would if such Losses
were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Article VIII regarding indemnification rights and
obligations shall be deemed to override any obligations with respect to
mitigation of Losses under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Oxford shall have rights of subrogation against the Wever Contractor in
respect of any matter for which Oxford indemnifies or holds harmless any
Cambridge Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(d).

 



 

(i) Any Losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such Losses.

 



 

(j) Cambridge shall have the right to withhold and set-off against any payment
due under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements the amount of any
claim for indemnification any Cambridge Indemnified Party is entitled to
pursuant to a written agreement between Oxford and Cambridge or a final
judicial determination in accordance with Section 12.9 (or other dispute
resolution mechanism agreed to in writing by Oxford and Cambridge). The
withholding and offset rights set forth in this Section 8.6(i) shall in no way
be deemed to limit or override Cambridges other remedies and rights under
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements under applicable Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes and related out-of-pocket
expenses, if any, arising out of or in connection with the Transactions shall
be borne by Holdco. The Party that is required under applicable Laws to file
Tax Returns with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file all
such necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer Taxes, promptly provide the other Parties such Tax Returns and any
related documentation and, to the extent required by applicable Law, Oxford,
Cambridge and Holdco shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
join in the preparation and execution of any such Tax Returns. To the extent
Oxford or any of its Affiliates files such Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes and pays such Transfer Taxes, Holdco shall indemnify and hold
harmless and, within ten (10) days of a written request therefor, reimburse
such Person for all such Transfer Taxes and any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Oxford shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns of each Purchased Company and each Target Company
Subsidiary that is due (taking account any extensions) on or prior to the
Closing Date and shall timely remit, or cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes
due in respect of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be made in a manner
consistent with past practices of each such Purchased Company or Target
Company Subsidiary, except to the extent (i) required by applicable Laws or
(ii) where filing such Tax Returns in a manner that is not consistent with
past practices of each such Purchased Company or Target Company Subsidiary
would not increase Taxes of or with respect to (or decrease a Tax attribute of
or otherwise available to) any such Purchased Company or Target Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be, for a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) Holdco shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall timely file or
cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by or in respect
of each Purchased Company or Target Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date,
other than any consolidated or combined Tax Return that is required to be
filed by Oxford or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than a
Purchased Company or Target Company Subsidiary), and shall timely remit, or
cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared and all elections with respect to such Tax
Returns shall be made in a manner consistent with past practices of each such
Purchased Company or Target Company Subsidiary, as applicable, except to the
extent required by applicable Law. Before filing any Straddle Period Tax
Return or any other Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Return, Holdco shall provide
Oxford with a copy of such Tax Return at least forty (40) days prior to the
last date for timely filing such Tax Return, and Holdco shall include, in the
Tax Return filed, all reasonable comments provided by Oxford with respect to
any such draft copy not later than five (5) days prior to such due date.
Oxford shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute any applicable powers
of attorney with respect to the filing of such Tax Returns. Holdco shall not,
without the written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of Oxford,
withdraw, repudiate, amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit to
be withdrawn, repudiated, amended, refiled or otherwise modified, any Tax
Return filed by or in respect of any Purchased Company or Target Company
Subsidiary for any taxable year or period beginning before the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) Oxford shall indemnify, defend and hold the Cambridge Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against, without duplication, (i) any Taxes imposed on or
with respect to any Target Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including
any part of the Straddle

 



       
 

 



 

Period before the Closing Date apportioned in accordance with Section 9.3(c),
(ii) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Target Company for which
Oxford or one of its Affiliates (other than any of the Target Companies) is
primarily liable and which Tax would not have arisen but for the relationship
on or at any time before the Closing Date of a Target Company with Oxford or
such Affiliate, including a Tax liability pursuant to section 39 and 43 of the
Tax Collection Act 1990 ( _Invorderingwet 1990_ ), or under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Laws in any
jurisdiction) as a result of the membership of any Target Company in an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary, or similar group for any taxable
period ending on or before, or that includes, the Closing Date, (iii) any
breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.14(e) and
4.14(f), (iv) any Transfer Taxes for which Oxford is responsible pursuant to
Section 9.1, (v) any Taxes relating to the Separation including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Dutch withholding Taxes on the Distribution, (vi) any
Taxes relating to or in connection with Oxfords and its Affiliates exit from
Egypt, (vii) any Taxes relating to or in connection with the separation of
Oxford Construction Limited and its Affiliates from Oxford and its Affiliates,
(viii) any Taxes with respect to the formation of, transfer of assets to or
sale of interest in OCI Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership, (ix) any
amounts payable under the Tax Claim Agreement dated February 6, 2015, by and
between Oxford and Oxford Construction Limited, and (x) any Taxes relating to
the failure of the Midwestern Disaster Relief Revenue Bonds, Series 2012 to
qualify as tax-exempt bonds; The obligations of Oxford pursuant to this
Section 9.3(a) shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations plus thirty (30) days.

 



 

(b) Except for such matters for which Oxford is required to indemnify the
Cambridge Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 9.3(a),
Holdco shall indemnify, defend and hold the Oxford Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against any (i) Taxes imposed on or with respect to any
Target Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period, including any part of the
Straddle Period after the Closing Date apportioned in accordance with Section
9.3(c), and (ii) any Transfer Taxes for which Holdco is responsible pursuant
to Section 9.1.

 



 

(c) Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to apportion between
Oxford and Cambridge the Taxes of a Target Company for a Straddle Period, such
liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close
of the Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books,
except that Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) imposed on a
periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

 



 

(d) Any indemnity payments made pursuant to Article VIII or this Article IX
shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment of the cash Consideration
described in Section 1.2 or Section 1.7, as appropriate, for all income tax
purposes except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
indemnity payments made pursuant to Article VIII or this Article IX shall be
increased by any Tax cost actually imposed on the Indemnified Party (including
by way of withholding Taxes) in respect of receipt of the indemnity payment,
and reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party in
respect of the Loss or Tax liability in respect of which the indemnity payment
is made.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.4 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing
agreements and arrangements between (i) a Target Company, on the one hand, and
(ii) Oxford or any Related Person, on the other hand, shall be terminated,
with respect to each such Target Company, effective as of the Closing Date and
have no further effect after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Record Retention_. The
Parties recognize that each Party may need access, from time to time, after
the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information of the
Target Companies held by Oxford, Cambridge, Holdco or any Target Company;
therefore, from and after the Closing Date, each Party shall, and shall cause
its applicable Affiliates (including the Target Companies) and Representatives
to, (a) retain and maintain all such records including all Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of a Target Company for each Pre-Closing Tax Period
and any Straddle Period until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute
of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate (giving effect to any valid extensions) or (ii) six (6) years
following the due date for such Tax Returns (giving effect to any valid
extensions), (b) allow the other Parties, their Affiliates and Representatives
(and Representatives of any of their Affiliates), upon reasonable notice and
at mutually convenient times, to access employees and to inspect, review and
make copies of such records (at the expense of the Party requesting the
records) as such Parties may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate from
time to time and (c) as reasonably requested by any Party, cooperate and make
employees available at mutually convenient times to provide additional
information or explanation of materials or documents. Any information obtained
under this Section 9.5 shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) If a claim for Taxes (including notice of a pending audit) is made by any
Tax Authority in writing (a " _Tax Contest_ "), which, if successful, might
result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 9.3, Holdco shall notify
Oxford in writing of the Tax Contest within ten (10) Business Days of the
receipt of such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide
such notice shall only reduce Oxfords liability to the extent that Oxford is
actually materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) Oxford shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and defend
against any Tax Contests to the extent they relate to Taxes for which Oxford
is obligated to indemnify the Cambridge Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 9.3; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco may participate in any such
Tax Contests at their own expense, including the right to attend any meeting
and participate in any communications with the relevant Tax Authority, to the
extent such Tax Contest relates to Taxes of a Purchased Company or Target
Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ , that Oxford shall not, and shall
not permit any other Person to, concede, settle or compromise a Tax Contest
(or portion thereof) to the extent such concession, settlement or compromise
could reasonably be expected to affect adversely Cambridge or their
Affiliates, including any increase in the Taxes of any Purchased Company or
Target Company Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period, without the prior
written consent of Holdco, which

 



      
 

 



 

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
, _further_ , that if Oxford fails to assume control of the conduct of any
such Tax Contest within thirty (30) days following the receipt by Oxford of
notice of such Tax Contest, Holdco may notify Oxford in writing that it has
failed to assume control of such Tax Contest, and if Oxford does not assume
control of such Tax Contest within five (5) Business Days after such notice,
Holdco shall have the right to assume control of such Tax Contest and shall be
empowered to settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Contest upon the prior
written consent of Oxford, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that Oxford may participate
in any Tax Contests described in the preceding clause at its own expense,
including the right to attend any meeting and participate in any
communications with the relevant Tax Authority, to the extent such Tax Contest
relates to Taxes of a Purchased Company or Target Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) The Cambridge Indemnified Parties shall have the sole right to control,
contest, resolve and defend against all Tax Contests of any Purchased Company
or Target Company Subsidiary that are not governed by Section 9.6(b) , other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Contests of a consolidated or combined
group of which Oxford or any of its Affiliates (other than a Target Company)
is the common parent.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Certain Actions._

 



 

(a) None of the Parties or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof may take or
agree to take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which action
or failure to act would or could reasonably be expected to cause Holdco to be
treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
following the Effective Time. None of Holdco, Oxford or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof may take or agree to take any action, or knowingly fail to
take any action, which action or failure to act would or could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Restructuring from qualifying for the Tax treatment
set forth in Section 1.6.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as expressly
authorized by the Restructuring Steps Plan or Article I, none of Oxford and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, nor shall they cause or permit any
Person to, (i) forgive any indebtedness of any of the Target Companies or
Holdco, (ii) make any capital contribution (without regard to whether or not
any Capital Stock is issued) to any of the Target Companies or Holdco, or
(iii) take any other action that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, could
be treated as, or deemed to be, the forgiveness of debt of or the contribution
of capital (without regard to whether or not any Capital Stock is issued) to
any of the Target Companies or Holdco.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from the date of this
Agreement until after the Effective Time, Oxford shall not (i) raise any new
capital, except by the issuance of instruments treated as indebtedness for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, but not including any indebtedness that is
convertible into the Capital Stock, or any other instrument treated as stock
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of Oxford that would participate in the
Distribution, (ii) issue any Capital Stock, or any other instrument treated as
stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that would participate in the
Distribution, except with respect to an exercise of the Convertible Bonds
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) issue any options to
acquire the Capital Stock, or any other instrument treated as stock for U.S.
federal income tax

 



      
 

 



 

purposes, of Oxford, except to the extent that such stock would not
participate in the Distribution, or (iv) receive any capital contribution
(without regard to whether or not any Capital Stock is issued) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, except to the extent that such capital
contribution is in exchange for stock that would not participate in the
Distribution.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as expressly
authorized by the Restructuring Steps Plan (as such Plan may be modified
pursuant to Section 3.1) , none of Oxford and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
shall, nor shall they cause or permit any Person to, modify the terms of any
intercompany indebtedness, including by refinancing, reissuance or otherwise,
between any of the Target Companies, provided that such intercompany
indebtedness may be incurred in the ordinary course of business or repaid in
cash.

 



 

(e) None of Oxford and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, nor shall they
cause or permit any Person to, transfer any of the Share Consideration to a
creditor of Oxford or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in satisfaction of
any indebtedness, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of Oxford or any of
its Subsidiaries that is associated with the Target Companies or the Business.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.7(e) shall prevent
Oxford or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from selling any Share
Consideration and using the proceeds from such sale to satisfy any
indebtedness of Oxford or any of its Subsidiaries that is associated with the
Target Companies or the Business, provided, however, no such cash proceeds
shall be transferred to a creditor of Oxford or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates if, to the knowledge of Oxford, such creditor was also the
purchaser of such Share Consideration.

Subsidiaries executes an agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
for Oxford (whether or not involving the same Acquisition Proposal as that

(50%) or more"), then Oxford shall, prior to or contemporaneously with the
consummation of such acquisition or transaction pay, or cause to be paid to
Cambridge, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by

(c) Each of Cambridge and Oxford acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 11.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if either party fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the
amount due pursuant to this Section 11.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
such party for the payment set forth in this Section 11.2 or any portion of
such payment, such party shall pay the other party its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in

which such payment was required through the date of actual payment. In no
event shall Cambridge or Oxford be obligated pursuant to this Section 11.2 to
pay more than one Cambridge Termination Payment or Oxford Termination Payment,
respectively.

control of Oxford.

 



 

(c) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in

or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such

the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein

of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or

interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in

instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have

purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Letters
delivered in connection herewith, the Ancillary Agreements and the

with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
representations, warranties, agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 



 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successor

negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with Section 12.8 without notice or liability to
any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Laws or public
policy in any situation or in any jurisdiction, all other terms and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order that the
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 12.6 _Assignments_.

 



 

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

their respective successors consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets (determined by its properties and assets after the
Closing) to any Person, then in each such case, proper provisions reasonably
acceptable to Oxford, in the case of Cambridge or Holdco as the consolidating,
merging, transferring or conveying Party, or Holdco, in the case of Oxford as
the consolidating, merging, transferring or conveying Party, shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the consolidating, merging, transferring or
conveying Party shall succeed to such Partys obligations set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , in connection with any of the foregoing, no
Party shall be released from any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.7 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this
Agreement to the stockholders of Cambridge or Oxford, but, after such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by applicable Laws or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties; _provided_ that no modification or amendment to this Agreement shall
be made that would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources as set
forth in Sections 12.4(b), this Section 12.7, Section 12.9(b) or Section 12.11
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 12.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the

directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or, except as
provided in Section 11.1(b)(iii) or (iv), conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. No waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement shall operate or
be construed as a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach, whether of a
similar or different character, unless expressly set forth in such written
instrument. Neither any course of conduct nor the failure or delay of any
Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights, remedies or powers under
this Agreement or otherwise shall constitute a waiver of those rights, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, remedy or
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power.

Section 12.14 _Provision Regarding Legal Representation_. Recognizing that

hereby prior to the Closing (the " _Engagement_ "), and that Cleary Gottlieb,
Allen and Overy and Orrick intend to act as legal counsel to Oxford and its
Affiliates (which will no longer include the Target Companies) after the

cause their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Target Companies) to
waive, any conflicts to the extent related to the Engagement that may arise in
connection with Cleary Gottlieb, Allen and Overy or Orrick representing Oxford
or any of its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate
to Holdco, Cambridge and the Target Companies or the Transactions. In
addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Oxford, the
Target Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Cleary
Gottlieb, Allen and Overy or Orrick, on the other hand, in the course of the
Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to Oxford and its Affiliates (and not the Target Companies).
Accordingly, the Target Companies shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Cleary Gottlieb, Allen and Overy or Orrick
relating to the Engagement from and after the Closing, and no actions taken by
Oxford or any of its Affiliates or Representatives to retain, remove or
otherwise protect such communications will be deemed a breach or violation of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) Oxford and its Affiliates (and
not the Target Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to communications relating to the Engagement, and no
Target Company shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Cleary Gottlieb, Allen and Overy or Orrick in respect of the Engagement
constitute property of the client, only Oxford and its Affiliates (and not the
Target Companies) shall hold such property rights and (c) neither Cleary
Gottlieb, Allen and Overy nor Orrick shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files in connection with
the Engagement to any of the Target Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Cleary Gottlieb, Allen and Overy or Orrick, as the case may
be, and the Target Companies or otherwise.

7. The Company may in its discretion issue share warrants to bearer in respect of any fully paid shares under a seal of the Company or in any other manner authorised by the board.

In any case in which a warrant is so issued, the board may provide for the payment of future dividends or other moneys on the shares represented by the warrant by coupons or otherwise.

8. The board may determine, and from time to time vary, the conditions on which share warrants to bearer shall be issued and, in particular (but without limitation), conditions on which:

 



 

(a) a new warrant or coupon shall be issued in place of one worn-out, defaced,

issue of the warrant. Subject to those conditions and to the provisions of the
Act, the bearer shall be deemed to be a member of the Company and shall have
the same rights and privileges as he would have if his name had been included
in the Register as the holder of the shares comprised in the warrant. The
bearer shall be subject to the conditions governing share warrants for the
time being in force whether made before or after the issue of warrants.

 



 

9. The Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise any right in respect of the share represented by a share warrant other than the bearers absolute right to the warrant.

13. Where the Company is entitled under any provision of the Statutes or these Articles to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, forfeit, re-allot, accept the surrender of, or otherwise enforce a lien over, a share held in uncertificated form, the Company shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of the Statutes and these Articles:

 



 

(a) to require the holder of that uncertificated share by notice to change
that share into certificated form within the period specified in the notice
and to hold that share in certificated form so long as required by the
Company; and

 



 

(b) to take any action that the board considers appropriate to achieve the
sale, transfer, disposal, forfeiture, re-allotment or surrender of that share,
or otherwise to enforce a lien in respect of that share.

 



 

14. The board has general and unconditional authority to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to the section 551 amount, for each prescribed 551 period.

 



 

15. The board is empowered for each prescribed 561 period to allot equity securities for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by Article 14 as if section 561 of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that its power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to the section 561 amount.

Article 15 the words "pursuant to the authority conferred by Article 14" were
omitted.

 



 

16. The Company may make an offer or agreement which would or might require shares to be allotted, or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares to be granted, after an authority given pursuant to Article 14 or a power given pursuant to Article 15 has expired. The board may allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares, in pursuance of that offer or agreement as if the authority or power pursuant to which that offer or agreement was made had not expired.

 



 

17. In this Article 17 and Articles 14, 15 and 16:

conferred by Article 14 is given by ordinary resolution stating the section
551 amount (which may be the same as the prescribed 561 period);

stated as such in the relevant ordinary resolution; and

stated as such in the relevant special resolution.

 



 

18. The directors shall be generally and unconditionally authorised pursuant to section 551 of the Act to:

 



 

(a) allot shares in the Company, and to grant rights to subscribe for or to
convert any security into shares in the Company, up to [*](1) shares for a
period expiring (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company
in general meeting) on the date which is five years from the date of the
adoption of these Articles by the Company; and

 



 

(b) make an offer or agreement which would or might require shares to be
allotted, or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares to be
granted, after expiry of the authority described in this Article 18 and the
directors may allot shares and grant rights in pursuance of that offer or
agreement as if this authority had not expired.

 



 

19. The directors shall be generally empowered pursuant to section 570 and section 573 of the Act to allot equity securities (as defined in the Act) for cash, pursuant to the authorities conferred by Article 18 as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to the allotment. This power:

 



 

(a) expires (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in
general meeting) on the date which is five years from the date of the adoption
of these Articles by the Company, but the Company may make an offer or
agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after
expiry of this power and the directors may allot equity securities in
pursuance of that offer or agreement as if this power had not expired; and

 



 

(b) shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities up to [*](2)
shares.

  (1) Note to draft: This amount shall represent [*]% of the outstanding shares
at closing.

 



 

(2) Note to draft: This amount shall represent [*]% of the outstanding shares
at closing.

 



      
 

 



 

This Article 19 applies in relation to a sale of shares which is an allotment
of equity securities by virtue of section 560(3) of the Act as if in the first
paragraph of the words "pursuant to the authorities conferred by Article 18"
were omitted.

 



 

20. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes relating to authority, pre-emption rights or otherwise and of any resolution of the Company in general meeting passed pursuant to those provisions, and, in the case of redeemable shares, the provisions of Article 27, all shares for the time being in the capital of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any increased capital) and all (if any) shares in the Company lawfully held by or on behalf of it shall be at the disposal of the board which may reclassify, allot (with or without conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, on such terms and conditions and at such times as it thinks fit.

 



 

21. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may exercise any power of the Company to establish a shareholders rights plan (the **_Rights Plan_** ). The Rights Plan may be in such form as the board shall in its absolute discretion decide and may in particular (but without restriction or limitation) include such terms as are described in the Summary of Example Terms in the form appearing in the Appendix to these Articles.

 



 

22. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may exercise any power of the Company to grant rights: (a) to subscribe for shares of the Company; or (b) to acquire shares of the Company, in each case in accordance with the Rights Plan (the **_Rights_** ).

 



 

23. The purposes for which the board shall be entitled to establish the Rights Plan and to grant Rights in accordance therewith, as provided in Articles 21 and 22, shall include (without limitation) the following where, in the opinion of the majority of the board members present at a duly convened board meeting, on such grounds as the board shall genuinely consider reasonable, irrespective of whether such grounds would be considered reasonable by any other person with or without the benefit of hindsight, to do so would improve the likelihood that:

 



 

(a) any process which may result in an acquisition or change or Control of the
Company is conducted in an orderly manner;

 



 

(b) any potential acquisition or change of Control of the Company will treat
all members of the Company holding the same class of shares equally and
fairly;

members of the Company;

business would be safeguarded; or

 



 

(g) the Company would not suffer serious economic harm.

 



 

24. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may determine not to redeem the Rights and accordingly exercise any power of the Company to allot shares of the Company pursuant to the exercise of the Rights in accordance with the Rights Plan. The purposes for which the board shall be entitled not to redeem the Rights, and accordingly to exercise any power of the Company to allot shares of the Company, shall include (without limitation) the following where, in the opinion of the majority of the board members present at a duly convened board meeting, on such grounds as the board shall genuinely consider reasonable, irrespective of whether such grounds would be considered reasonable by any other person with or without

 



      
 

 



 

the benefit of hindsight, not to redeem the Rights and accordingly to exercise
any power of the Company to allot shares in the Company would improve the
likelihood that:

 



 

(a) the use of abusive tactics by any person in connection with any potential
acquisition or change of Control of the Company would be prevented;

 



 

(b) any potential acquisition or change of Control of the Company that would
be unlikely to treat all members of the Company holding the same class of
shares equally and fairly would be prevented;

 



 

(c) any potential acquisition or change of Control of the Company at a price
that would undervalue the Company or its shares would be prevented;

 



 

(d) any potential acquisition or change of Control of the Company that would
be likely to harm the prospects of the success of the Company for the benefit
of its members as a whole would be prevented;

 



 

(e) the long term interests of the Company, its employees, its members and its
business would be safeguarded; or

 



 

(f) the Company would not suffer serious economic harm.

 



 

25. For the purposes of Articles 23 and 24, a person shall be deemed to have control ( ** _Control_** ) of the Company if he, either alone or as part of a group of affiliated or associated persons, exercises, or is able to exercise or is entitled to acquire, the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the preceding words, if he, either alone or as part of a group of affiliated or associated persons, possesses or is entitled to acquire:

 



 

(a) beneficial ownership of 15 per cent. or more of the voting rights
attributable to the capital of the Company which are generally exercisable at
a general meeting; or

 



 

(b) such percentage of the issued share capital of the Company as would, if
the whole of the income or assets of the Company were in fact distributed
among the members (without regard to any rights which he or any other person
has as a loan creditor), entitle him, either alone or as part of a group of
affiliated or associated persons, to receive 15 per cent. or more of the
income or assets so distributed; or

 



 

(c) such rights as would, in the event of the winding-up of the Company or in
any other circumstances, entitle him, either alone or as part of a group of
affiliated or associated persons, to receive 15 per cent. or more of the
assets of the Company which would then be available for distribution among the
members.

 



 

26. For the purposes of Article 25:

 



 

(a) **_person_** shall include any individual, firm, body corporate,
unincorporated association, government, state or agency of state, association,

including the Exchange Act;

entitled to acquire at a future date, or will at a future date be entitled to
acquire, irrespective of whether such future acquisition is contingent upon
satisfaction of any conditions precedent;

for him, that is to say, any rights or powers which another person possesses
on his behalf or may be required to exercise on his direction or behalf; and

 



 

(d) **_beneficial ownership_** of any person or group of affiliated or
associated persons shall have the meaning given to such term under the U.S.
federal securities laws, including

right or interest that would be required to be set forth in any notice if the
person or group in question were a member giving notice under these Articles.

 



 

27. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares or class of shares, shares may be issued which are to be redeemed or are to be liable to be redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder.

28. The Company may exercise all powers of paying commissions or brokerage conferred or permitted by the Statutes.

29. Except as required by law, the Company shall recognise no person as holding any share on any trust and (except as otherwise provided by these Articles or by law) the Company shall not be bound by or recognise any interest in any share (or in any fractional part of a share) except the holders absolute right to the entirety of the share (or fractional part of the share).

 



 

30. The Company may give financial assistance for the acquisition of shares by the Company to the extent that it is not restricted by the Statutes.

 



 

 ** _VARIATION OF RIGHTS_**

 



 

31. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, if at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may (unless otherwise provided by the terms of allotment of the shares of that class) be varied or abrogated, whether or not the Company is being wound up, either:

 



 

(a) with the written consent of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value
of the issued shares of the class, which consent shall be in hard copy form or
in electronic form sent to such address (if any) for the time being specified
by or on behalf of the Company for that purpose, or in default of such
specification to the office, and may consist of several documents, each
executed or authenticated in such manner as the board may approve by or on
behalf of one or more holders, or a combination of both; or

 



 

(b) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general
meeting of the holders of the shares of the class, but not otherwise.

 



 

32. For the purposes of Article 31, if at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to any share or class of shares, those rights shall be deemed to be varied by:

 



 

(a) the reduction of the capital paid up on that share or class of shares
otherwise than by a purchase or redemption by the Company of its own shares;
and

 



 

(b) the allotment of another share ranking in priority for payment of a
dividend or in respect of capital or which confers on its holder voting rights
more favourable than those conferred by that share or class of shares,

 



 

but shall not be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of another share
ranking equally with, or subsequent to, that share or class of shares or by
the purchase or redemption by the Company of its own shares.

 



 

33. Subject to the terms on which any shares may be issued, the rights or privileges attached to any class of shares in the capital of the Company shall be deemed not to be varied or

 



      
 

 



 

abrogated by the creation or issue of any new shares ranking _pari passu_ in
substantially all respects (save as to the date from which such new shares
shall rank for dividend) with or subsequent to those already issued or by any
purchase by the Company of its own shares.

 



 

 ** _SHARES IN UNCERTIFICATED FORM_**

 



 

34. The directors shall have power to implement such arrangements as they may, in their absolute discretion, deem fit in order for any class of shares to be a participating security (subject always to the Regulations and the facilities and requirements of the Relevant System concerned). Where they do so, Articles 35 and 36 shall come into effect immediately prior to the time at which the Operator of the Relevant System concerned permits the class of shares concerned to be a participating security.

 



 

35. In relation to any class of shares which is, for the time being, a participating security, and for so long as such class remains a participating security, no provision of these Articles shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with:

 



 

(a) the holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form;

 



 

(b) the transfer of title to shares of the class by means of a Relevant
System; or

 



 

(c) the Regulations,

 



 

and, without prejudice to the generality of this Article 35, no provision of
these Articles shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any
respect inconsistent with the maintenance, keeping or entering by the
Operator, so long as that is permitted or required by the Regulations, of an
Operator register of securities in respect of shares of that class in
uncertificated form.

 



 

36. Without prejudice to the generality of Article 35 and notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles where any class of shares is, for the time being, a participating security (such class being referred to in these Articles as the **_Relevant Class_** ):

 



 

(a) shares of the Relevant Class may be issued in uncertificated form in
accordance with and subject as provided in the Regulations;

 



 

(b) unless the board otherwise determines, shares of the Relevant Class held
by the same holder or joint holder in certificated form and uncertificated
form shall be treated as separate holdings;

 



 

(c) shares of the Relevant Class may be changed from uncertificated to
certificated form, and from certificated to uncertificated form, in accordance
with and subject as provided in the Regulations;

 



 

(d) title to shares of the Relevant Class which are recorded on the Register
as being held in uncertificated form may be transferred by means of the
Relevant System concerned and accordingly (and in particular) Article 62 shall
not apply in respect of such shares to the extent that those Articles require
or contemplate the effecting of a transfer by an instrument in writing and the
production of a certificate for the share to be transferred;

 



 

(e) the Company shall comply with the provisions of Regulations 25 and 26 in
relation to the Relevant Class;

 



 

(f) the provisions of these Articles with respect to meetings of or including
holders of the Relevant Class, including notices of such meetings, shall have
effect subject to the provisions of Regulation 41; and

 



 

(g) Articles 39 to 43 shall not apply so as to require the Company to issue a
certificate to any person holding shares of the Relevant Class in
uncertificated form.

 



       
 

 



 

37. If, under these Articles or the Statutes, the Company is entitled to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, forfeit, re-allot, accept the surrender of or otherwise enforce a lien over an uncertificated share then, subject to these Articles and the Statutes, such entitlement shall include the right of the board to:

 



 

(a) require the holder of the uncertificated share by notice in writing to
change that share from uncertificated to certificated form within such period
as may be specified in the notice and keep it as a certificated share for so
long as the board requires;

 



 

(b) appoint any person to take such other steps, by instruction given by means
of a Relevant System or otherwise, in the name of the holder of such share as
may be required to effect the transfer of such share and such steps shall be
effective as if they had been taken by the registered holder of that share;
and

 



 

(c) take such other action that the board considers appropriate to achieve the
sale, transfer, disposal, forfeiture, re-allotment or surrender of that share
or otherwise enforce a lien in respect of that share.

 



 

38. The Company shall be entitled to assume that the entries of any record of securities maintained by it in accordance with the Regulations and regularly reconciled with the relevant register of securities held by the Operator are a complete and accurate reproduction of the particulars entered into the register of securities held by the Operator and shall accordingly not be liable in respect of any act or thing done or omitted to be done by or on behalf of the Company in reliance upon such assumption, and, in particular, any provision of these Articles which requires or envisages that action will be taken in reliance on information contained in the Register shall be construed to permit that action to be taken in reliance on information contained in any relevant register of securities (as so maintained and reconciled).

 



 

 ** _SHARE CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

39. Subject to these Articles and the provisions of the Regulations, every member (except a person in respect of whom the Company is not by law required to complete and have ready for delivery a certificate), on becoming the holder of a share shall be entitled, except as provided by the Statutes, without payment, to one certificate for all the shares of each class held by him (and, on transferring a part of his holding of shares of any class, to a certificate for the balance of his holding of shares). Each member may elect to receive one or more additional certificates for any of his shares if he pays a reasonable sum determined from time to time by the board for every certificate after the first.

 



 

40. Every certificate shall:

 



 

(a) be executed by the Company in such manner as the board, having regard to
the Statutes, may approve; and

 



 

(b) specify the number, class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the
shares to which it relates and the nominal value of and the amount paid up on
the shares.

 



 

41. The board may by resolution decide, either generally or in particular case or cases, that any signatures or any certificates for shares or any other form of security issued at any time by the Company need not be autographic but may be applied to the certificates by some mechanical means or may be printed on them or that the certificates need not be signed by any person.

 



 

42. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them.

 



      
 

 



 

43. If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed, it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and payment of any exceptional out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating evidence and preparing the requisite form of indemnity as the board may determine but otherwise free of charge, and (in the case of defacement or wearing out) on delivery up of the old certificate.

 



 

 ** _LIEN_**

 



 

44. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all monies payable to the Company (whether presently or not) in respect of that share. The board may at any time (generally or in a particular case) waive any lien or declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article 44\. The Companys lien on a share shall extend to any amount (including, without limitation, dividends) payable in respect of it.

 



 

45. The Company may sell, in such manner as the board determines, any share on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within 14 clear days after notice in writing has been sent to the holder of the share in question, or to the person entitled to it by transmission, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and stating that if the notice is not complied with the share may be sold.

 



 

46. To give effect to any such sale, the board may authorise such person as it directs to execute an instrument of transfer in respect of the share sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer. If the share is an uncertificated share, the board may exercise any of the powers of the Company under Article 13 to effect the sale of the share. The buyer shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money and his title to the share shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in relation to the sale.

 



 

47. The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in or towards payment or satisfaction of so much of the sum in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable. Any residue shall (if the share sold is a certificated share, on surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate in respect of the share sold and, whether the share sold is a certificated share or an uncertificated share, subject to a like lien for any monies not presently payable as existed on the share before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the share at the date of the sale.

 



 

 ** _CALLS ON SHARES_**

 



 

48. Subject to the terms of allotment of any shares, the board may from time to time make calls on the members in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal value or premium). Each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the Company the amount called on his shares as required by the notice. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A call may be revoked in whole or part and the time fixed for payment of a call may be postponed in whole or part as the board may determine. A person on whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made on him even if the shares in respect of which the call was made are subsequently transferred.

 



 

49. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the board authorising the call was passed.

 



 

50. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of it.

 



 

51. If a call or any instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the amount

 



      
 

 



 

unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it is actually paid.
Interest shall be paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the
share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, the rate
determined by the board, not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum, or, if higher,
the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act), but the board may in respect of
any individual member waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. No
dividend or other payment or distribution in respect of any such share shall
be paid or distributed and no other rights which would otherwise normally be
exercisable in accordance with these Articles may be exercised by a holder of
any such share so long as any such sum or any interest or expenses payable in
accordance with this Article 51 in relation thereto remains due.

 



 

52. An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call duly made and notified and payable on the date so fixed or in accordance with the terms of the allotment. If it is not paid, the provisions of these Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

 



 

53. Subject to the terms of allotment, the board may make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the allottees or holders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares.

 



 

54. The board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid on any share held by him. Such payment in advance of calls shall extinguish the liability on the share in respect of which it is made to the extent of the payment. The Company may pay on all or any of the monies so advanced (until they would but for such advance become presently payable) interest at such rate agreed between the board and the member not exceeding (unless the Company by ordinary resolution otherwise directs) 15 per cent. per annum or, if higher, the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act).

 



 

 ** _FORFEITURE AND SURRENDER_**

 



 

55. If a call or any instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part after it has become due and payable, the board may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such call or instalment remains unpaid, give the person from whom it is due not less than 14 clear days notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

 



 

56. If that notice is not complied with, any share in respect of which it was sent may, at any time before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the board to that effect. The forfeiture shall include all dividends or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited share which have not been paid before the forfeiture. When a share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be sent to the person who was the holder of the share before the forfeiture. An entry shall be made promptly in the Register opposite the entry of the share showing that notice has been sent, that the share has been forfeited and the date of forfeiture, which shall be deemed to occur at the time of the passing of the relevant board resolution. No forfeiture shall be invalidated by the omission or neglect to send that notice or to make those entries.

 



 

57. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, a forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the board determines, either to the person who was the holder before the forfeiture or to any other person. At any time before sale, re-allotment or other disposal, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the board thinks fit. Where for the purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

its disposal a forfeited share is to be transferred to any person, the board
may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to
that person. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share held in
uncertificated form is to be transferred to any person, the board may exercise
any of the powers of the Company under Article 8\. The Company may receive the
consideration given for the share on its disposal and may register the
transferee as holder of the share.

 



 

58. A person, any of whose shares have been forfeited, shall cease to be a member in respect of any share which has been forfeited and shall, if the share is held in certificated form, surrender the certificate for any forfeited share to the Company for cancellation. The person shall remain liable to the Company for all monies which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of that share with interest on that amount at the rate at which interest was payable on those monies before the forfeiture or, if no interest was so payable, at the rate determined by the board, not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum or, if higher, the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act), from the date of forfeiture until payment. The board may waive payment wholly or in part or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the share at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on its disposal.

 



 

59. The board may accept the surrender of any share which it is in a position to forfeit on such terms and conditions as may be agreed. Subject to those terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it had been forfeited.

 



 

60. The forfeiture or surrender of a share shall involve the extinction at the time of forfeiture or surrender of all interest in and all claims and demands against the Company in respect of the share and all other rights and liabilities incidental to the share as between the person whose share is forfeited or surrendered and the Company, except only those rights and liabilities expressly saved by these Articles, or as are given or imposed in the case of past members by the Statutes.

 



 

61. A statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been duly forfeited or surrendered on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share. The declaration shall (subject if necessary to the execution of an instrument of transfer, if necessary) constitute a good title to the share. The person to whom the share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, and his title to the share shall not be affected by any irregularity in, or invalidity of, the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, surrender, sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.

 



 

 ** _TRANSFER OF SHARES_**

 



 

62. Without prejudice to any power of the Company to register as a member a person to whom the right to any share has been transmitted by operation of law, an instrument of transfer may be in any usual form or in any other form which the board may approve. An instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, unless the share is fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee. An instrument of transfer need not be under seal.

 



 

63. The board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register the transfer of a share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis.

 



 

64. The board may also refuse to register the transfer of a share:

 



 

(a) unless the instrument of transfer:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) is lodged, duly stamped (if the Statutes so require), at the office or at
another place appointed by the board, accompanied by the certificate for the
shares to which it relates and such other evidence (if any) as the board may
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
and

 



 

(ii) is in respect of only one class of shares, or is in favour of not more
than four transferees;

 



 

(b) if it is with respect to a share on which the Company has a lien and a sum
in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid
within 14 clear days after notice has been sent to the holder of the share in
accordance with Article 45; or

 



 

(c) if it is a certificated share and is not presented for registration
together with the share certificate and such evidence of title as the Company
reasonably requires.

 



 

65. If the board refuses to register a transfer of a share, it shall send the transferee notice of its refusal within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company, together with reasons for the refusal.

 



 

66. No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of transfer or other document relating to or affecting the title to a share.

 



 

67. The Company shall be entitled to retain an instrument of transfer which is registered, but an instrument of transfer which the board refuses to register (except in the case of fraud) shall be returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is sent.

 



 

68. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Articles shall require shares to be transferred by a written instrument if the Statutes provide otherwise and the directors shall be empowered to implement such arrangements as they consider fit in accordance with and subject to the Statutes and the rules of the NYSE to regulate the transfer of title to shares in the Company and for the approval or disapproval, as the case may be, by the board or the Operator of any Relevant System of the registration of those transfers.

 



 

 ** _TRANSMISSION OF SHARES_**

 



 

69. If a member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest. Nothing in these Articles shall release the estate of a deceased member (whether a sole or joint holder) from any liability in respect of any share held by him solely or jointly with other persons.

 



 

70. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share may, on production of any evidence as to his entitlement reasonably required by the board and subject to these Articles, elect either to be registered as the holder of the share or to have another person nominated by him registered as the transferee. If he elects to become the holder, he shall send notice to the Company to that effect. If he elects to have another person registered and the share is a certificated share, he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. If he elects to have himself or another person registered and the share is an uncertificated share, he shall take any action the board may require (including without limitation the execution of any document) to enable himself or that person to be registered as the holder of the share. All the provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer of shares apply to that notice or instrument of transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the member and the death or bankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred.

 



 

71. The board may at any time send a notice requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share. If the notice is not complied with within 60 days, the board may after the expiry of that period withhold payment of all dividends or other

 



      
 

 



 

monies payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice
have been complied with.

 



 

72. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share shall, on production of any evidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board and subject to the requirements of Article 70, have the same rights in relation to the share as he would have had if he were the holder of the share, subject to Article 231\. That person may give a discharge for all dividends and other monies payable in respect of the share, but he shall not (except with the authority of the board), before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any meeting of the Company or to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company.

 



 

 ** _ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL_**

 



 

73. The Company may by ordinary resolution alter its share capital in accordance with the Act.

 



 

74. All shares created by increase of the Companys share capital (unless otherwise provided by the terms of allotment of the shares of that class), by consolidation, division or sub-division of its share capital or the conversion of stock into paid-up shares shall be subject to all the provisions of these Articles, including without limitation provisions relating to payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, transfer and transmission.

 



 

75. Whenever any fractions arise as a result of a consolidation or sub-division of shares, the board may on behalf of the members deal with the fractions as it thinks fit, and, in particular, the board may sell shares representing fractions to which any members would otherwise become entitled to any person (including, subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion among those members. Where the shares to be sold are held in certificated form, the board may authorise a person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer. Where the shares to be sold are held in uncertificated form, the board may do all acts and things it considers necessary or expedient to effect the transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer. The buyer shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase monies and his title to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in, or invalidity of, the proceedings in relation to the sale.

 



 

 ** _PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES_**

 



 

76. On any purchase by the Company of its own shares, neither the Company nor the board shall be required to select the shares to be purchased rateably or in any manner as between the holders of shares of the same class or as between them and the holders of shares of any other class or in accordance with the rights as to dividends or capital conferred by any class of shares.

 



 

 ** _GENERAL MEETINGS_**

 



 

77. The Company shall hold general meetings as annual general meetings in accordance with the requirements of the Statutes. The annual general meeting shall be held at such time and place as the board may appoint.

 



 

78. All provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings of the Company shall, _mutatis mutandis_ , apply to every separate general meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, except that:

 



 

(a) the necessary quorum at any such meeting (or adjournment thereof) shall be
members of that class who together represent at least the majority of the
voting rights of all the

 



      
 

 



 

members of that class entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, at the
relevant meeting;

 



 

(b) all votes shall be taken on a poll; and

 



 

(c) each holder of shares of the class shall, on a poll, have one vote in
respect of every share of the class held by him.

 



 

79. The board may call general meetings whenever and at such times and places as it shall determine. On the requisition of members pursuant to the provisions of the Statutes, the board shall promptly convene a general meeting in accordance with the requirements of the Statutes.

 



 

 ** _NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS_**

 



 

80. An annual general meeting shall be called by not less than 21 clear days notice in writing and no more than 60 days notice in writing. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, all other general meetings may be called by not less than 14 clear days notice in writing and no more than 60 days notice in writing.

 



 

81. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, to the provisions of these Articles and to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice shall be sent to every member and every director. The auditors are entitled to receive all notices of, and other communications relating to, any general meeting which any member is entitled to receive.

 



 

82. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the notice shall specify the time, date and place of the meeting (including without limitation any satellite meeting place arranged for the purposes of Article 85, which shall be identified as such in the notice), and the general nature of the business to be dealt with and shall state, with reasonable prominence, that a member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, to speak and to vote instead of him and that a proxy need not be a member.

 



 

83. In the case of an annual general meeting, the notice shall specify the meeting as such. In the case of a meeting to pass a special resolution, the notice shall include the text of the resolution and shall specify the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution.

 



 

84. The notice shall include details of any arrangements made for the purpose of Article 87 (making clear that participation in those arrangements will not amount to attendance at the meeting to which the notice relates).

 



 

85. The board may resolve to enable persons entitled to attend a general meeting to do so by simultaneous attendance and participation at a satellite meeting place anywhere in the world. The members present in person or by proxy at satellite meeting places shall be counted in the quorum for, and entitled to vote at, the general meeting in question, and that meeting shall be duly constituted and its proceedings valid if the chairman of the general meeting is satisfied that adequate facilities are available throughout the general meeting to ensure that members attending at all the meeting places are able to:

 



 

(a) participate in the business for which the meeting has been convened;

 



 

(b) hear and see all persons who speak (whether by the use of microphones,
loudspeakers, audio-visual communications equipment or otherwise) in the
principal meeting place and any satellite meeting place; and

 



 

(c) be heard and seen by all other persons so present in the same way.

 



 

The chairman of the general meeting shall be present at, and the meeting shall
be deemed to take place at, the principal meeting place.

 



      
 

 



 

86. If it appears to the chairman of the general meeting that the facilities at the principal meeting place or any satellite meeting place have become inadequate for the purposes referred to in Article 85, then the chairman may, without the consent of the meeting, interrupt or adjourn the general meeting. All business conducted at that general meeting up to the time of that adjournment shall be valid. The provisions of Article 100 shall apply to that adjournment.

 



 

87. The board may make arrangements for persons entitled to attend a general meeting or an adjourned general meeting to be able to view and hear the proceedings of the general meeting or adjourned general meeting and to speak at the meeting (whether by the use of microphones, loudspeakers, audio-visual communications equipment or otherwise) by attending at a venue anywhere in the world not being a satellite meeting place. Those attending at any such venue shall not be regarded as present at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting and shall not be entitled to vote at the meeting at or from that venue. The inability for any reason of any member present in person or by proxy at such a venue to view or hear all or any of the proceedings of the meeting or to speak at the meeting shall not in any way affect the validity of the proceedings of the meeting.

 



 

88. The board may from time to time make any arrangements for controlling the level of attendance at any venue for which arrangements have been made pursuant to Article 86 (including without limitation the issue of tickets or the imposition of some other means of selection) which it, in its absolute discretion, considers appropriate, and may from time to time change those arrangements. If a member, pursuant to those arrangements, is not entitled to attend in person or by proxy at a particular venue, he shall be entitled to attend in person or by proxy at any other venue for which arrangements have been made pursuant to Article 86\. The entitlement of any member to be present at such venue in person or by proxy shall be subject to any such arrangement then in force and stated by the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting to apply to the meeting.

 



 

89. If, after the sending of notice of a general meeting but before the meeting is held, or after the adjournment of a general meeting but before the adjourned meeting is held (whether or not notice of the adjourned meeting is required), the board decides that it is impracticable or unreasonable, for a reason beyond its control, to hold the meeting at the declared place (or any of the declared places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 85 applies) or time, it may change the place (or any of the places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 85 applies) and/or postpone the time at which the meeting is to be held. If such a decision is made, the board may then change the place (or any of the places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 85 applies) and/or postpone the time again if it decides that it is reasonable to do so. In either case:

 



 

(a) no new notice of the meeting need be sent, but the board shall, if
practicable, advertise the date, time and place of the meeting by public
announcement and in two newspapers with national circulation in the United
Kingdom and shall make arrangements for notices of the change of place and/or
postponement to appear at the original place and/or at the original time; and

 



 

(b) a proxy appointment in relation to the meeting may, if by means of a
document in hard copy form, be delivered to the office or to such other place
within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company
in accordance with Article 144(a) or, if in electronic form, be received at
the address (if any) specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance
with Article 144(b).

 



 

For the purposes of this Article 89, **_public announcement_** shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by Reuters, the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or a comparable news service or other method of public
announcement as the board may deem appropriate in the circumstances.

 



      
 

 



 

90. For the purposes of Articles 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89, the right of a member to participate in the business of any general meeting shall include without limitation the right to speak, vote on a poll, be represented by a proxy and have access to all documents which are required by the Statutes or these Articles to be made available at the meeting.

 



 

91. The accidental omission to send a notice of a meeting or resolution, or to send any omission to send notification where required by the Statutes or these Articles in relation to the publication of a notice of meeting on a website, or to send a form of proxy where required by the Statutes or these Articles, to any person entitled to receive it, or the non-receipt for any reason of any such notice, resolution or notification or form of proxy by that person, whether or not the Company is aware of such omission or non-receipt, shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

 



 

92. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairman may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction it or he considers appropriate to ensure the security of a general meeting including, without limitation, requirements for evidence of identity to be produced by those attending the meeting, the searching of their personal property and the restriction of items that may be taken into the meeting place. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairman are entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with these arrangements, requirements or restrictions.

 



 

93. The chairman of each general meeting of the Company may take such action as he considers appropriate to permit the orderly conduct of the business of the meeting as set out in the notice of the meeting and the chairmans discretion on matters of procedure or arising incidentally from the business of the meeting shall be final as shall be his determination as to whether any matter is of such a nature.

 



 

94. The board may postpone a general meeting if it deems it necessary to do so. Notice of such postponement shall be given in accordance with these Articles.

 



 

 ** _PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS_**

 



 

95. No business shall be dealt with at any general meeting unless a quorum is present, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the choice or appointment of a chairman in accordance with these Articles, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting. Save as otherwise provided by these Articles, a quorum is the members who together represent at least the majority of the voting rights of all members entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, at the relevant meeting.

 



 

96. If such a quorum is not present within five minutes (or such longer time not exceeding 30 minutes as the chairman of the meeting may decide) from the time appointed for the meeting, or if during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting, if convened on the requisition of members, shall be dissolved, and in any other case shall stand adjourned to such time and place (being not less than 14 days nor more than 28 days thereafter) as the chairman of the meeting may, subject to the provisions of the Statutes, determine. The adjourned meeting shall be dissolved if a quorum is not present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting.

 



 

97. The chairman, if any, of the board or, in his absence, any deputy chairman of the Company shall preside as chairman of the meeting. If neither the chairman nor the deputy chairman is present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is not willing to act as chairman, the directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman. If there is only one director present and willing to act, he shall be chairman. If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present in person or by proxy and entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

vote shall choose a member present in person or a proxy of a member or a
person authorised to act as a representative of a corporation in relation to
the meeting to be chairman.

 



 

98. A director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company. Subject to the Statutes, the chairman may invite any person to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company whom the chairman considers to be equipped by knowledge or experience of the Companys business to assist in the deliberations of the meeting. In addition, the chairman may invite any person who has been nominated by a member of the Company (provided that the chairman is satisfied that at such time as the chairman may determine, the member holds any shares in the Company as such persons nominee) to attend and, if the chairman considers it appropriate, to speak at general meetings.

 



 

99. Without prejudice to any other power of adjournment which he may have under these Articles or at common law, the chairman:

 



 

(a) may adjourn a meeting from time to time and from place to place without
giving any reason therefore and without notice other than announcement at the
meeting;

 



 

(b) shall, if so directed by a meeting at which a quorum is present, adjourn
the meeting from time to time and from place to place; or

 



 

(c) may adjourn the meeting to another time and place if it appears to him
that:

 



 

(i) it is likely to be impracticable to hold or continue that meeting because
of the number of members wishing to attend who are not present;

 



 

(ii) the unruly conduct of persons attending the meeting prevents or is likely
to prevent the orderly continuation of the business of the meeting; or

 



 

(iii) an adjournment is otherwise necessary so that the business of the
meeting may be properly conducted, including where the chairman determines
that proper conduct requires an adjournment to enable time for consideration
of new information, and

 



 

each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Article 99 shall constitute a
separate power to adjourn and no such paragraph shall limit or restrict the
power contained in another such paragraph.

 



 

100. No business shall be dealt with at an adjourned meeting other than business which might properly have been dealt with at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place. Any such adjournment may, subject to the provisions of the Statutes, be for such time and to such other place (or, in the case of a meeting held at a principal meeting place and a satellite meeting place, such other places) as the chairman may, in his absolute discretion determine, notwithstanding that by reason of such adjournment some members may be unable to be present at the adjourned meeting. Any such member may nevertheless appoint a proxy for the adjourned meeting either in accordance with Article 144 or by means of a document in hard copy form which, if delivered at the meeting which is adjourned to the chairman or the secretary or any director, shall be valid even though it is given at less notice than would otherwise be required by Article 144(a). When a meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more or for an indefinite period, notice shall be sent at least seven clear days before the date of the adjourned meeting specifying the time and place (or places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 85 applies) of the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to send any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be dealt with at an adjourned meeting.

 



 

101. If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out of order by the chairman, the proceedings on the substantive resolution shall not be

 



       
 

 



 

invalidated by any error in such ruling. With the consent of the chairman, an
amendment may be withdrawn by its proposer before it is voted on. No amendment
to a resolution duly proposed as a special resolution may be considered or
voted on (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error). No
amendment to a resolution duly proposed as an ordinary resolution may be
considered or voted on (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a
patent error) unless either:

 



 

(a) at least 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or
adjourned meeting at which the ordinary resolution is to be considered (which,
if the board so specifies, shall be calculated taking no account of any part
of a day that is not a working day), notice of the terms of the amendment and
the intention to move it has been delivered in hard copy form to the office or
to such other place as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company for
that purpose, or received in electronic form at such address (if any) for the
time being specified by or on behalf of the Company for that purpose and such
notice of amendment shall provide the information required under Article 106
relating to the proposing member or Shareholder Associated Person (as defined
in Article 106) of such a member as if the notice was of a resolution proposed
by such member in accordance with that Article; and

 



 

(b) the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the
chairman, materially alter the scope of the resolution.

 



 

102. A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting shall be decided on a poll. This requirement for poll voting on resolutions at a general meeting of the Company may only be removed, amended or varied by resolution of the members passed unanimously at a general meeting of the Company.

 



 

103. Subject to Article 104, a poll shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs and he may, and shall if required by the meeting, appoint scrutineers (who need not be members) and fix a time and place for declaring the result of the poll. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.

 



 

104. A poll on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken immediately. A poll on any other question shall be taken at either the meeting or at such time and place as the chairman directs not being more than 28 days after the meeting.

 



 

105. Where for any purpose an ordinary resolution of the Company is required, a special resolution shall also be effective.

respective affiliates and associates, on the other hand, including, without
limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to
Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act if
the member making the nomination and any Shareholder Associated Person of such
member on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or
associate thereof, were the "registrant" for the purposes of such rule and the
nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; and

 



 

(d) set forth, to the extent known by the member(s) making the request, the
name and address of any other member supporting the nominee for election or
re-election as a director or the proposal of other business on the date of
such request,

 



 

provided that (1) with respect to each nominee for appointment or
reappointment to the board, the Company may require any proposed nominee for
appointment to the board to furnish such other information as may be required
by the board to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as
an Independent Director or that could be material to a reasonable members
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee under the
listing standards of each principal securities exchange upon which the shares
are listed, any applicable rules of the SEC and any publicly disclosed
standards used by the board

 



      
 

 



 

in determining and disclosing the independence of directors; and (2) the
information required by this Article 106 shall be supplemented so as to
operate by reference to and be accurate as at the record date for the
applicable general meeting by the member(s) making the applicable request not
later than ten (10) calendar days after such record date; and provided further
that such business must otherwise be a proper matter for member action.

 



 

For the purposes of this Article 106, a **_Shareholder Associated Person_** of
any member shall mean (i) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or
acting in concert with, such member, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of
stock of the Company owned of record or beneficially by such member, and (iii)
any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such
Shareholder Associated Person.

 



 

Subject to the provisions of these Articles, only a person who (i) is
nominated by or at the direction of the board; (ii) is nominated in compliance
with and otherwise complies with the procedures set forth in this Article 106;
or (iii) so long as the Shareholders Agreement is in force, is a Capricorn
Director appointed in accordance with Articles 155 and 156, shall be eligible
to serve as a director and only such business shall be conducted at a general
meeting as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction
of the board or pursuant to a member request that complies with the procedures
set forth in this Article 106.

 



 

Except as otherwise provided by law or the Articles, the chairman of the
meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a member request
was made in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article 106 and,
if any request is not in compliance with this Article 106, to declare that
such defective request shall be disregarded.

 



 

To be eligible to be a nominee for appointment or reappointment as a director
(other than a Capricorn Director, provided that the Shareholders Agreement is
in full force and effect and Capricorn is entitled to appoint at least one
Capricorn Director in accordance with Articles 155 and 156) pursuant to a
proposal made by a member or members pursuant to this Article 106, a person
must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of
request set forth in this Article 106) to the secretary at the office a
written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such
person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the
nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the
secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in
the form provided by the secretary upon written request) that such person:

 



 

(a) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (whether written or oral) with, and has not given and will not
give any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such
person, if appointed as a director of the Company, will act or vote on any
issue or question (any such agreement, arrangement, understanding, commitment
or assurance, a **_Voting Commitment_** ) that has not been disclosed to the
Company;

 



 

(b) is not and will not become a party to any Voting Commitment that could
limit or interfere with such persons ability to comply, if appointed as a
director of the Company, with such persons fiduciary duties under applicable
law;

 



 

(c) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (whether written or oral) with any person or entity other than
the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement
or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has
not been disclosed therein;

 



 

(d) in such persons individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity
on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if
appointed as a director of the Company, and will comply with all applicable
corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, securities
ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Company and any other
policies and guidelines of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

applicable to directors or adopted by the board (such policies and guidelines
to be made available to such person by the secretary on request); and

 



 

(e) irrevocably submits his resignation as a director effective upon a finding
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person has breached such
written representation and agreement,

 



 

provided that such person must in addition deliver to the secretary at the
office not later than 5:00 p.m., local time, on the tenth (10th) calendar day
after the record date for the applicable general meeting, an updated
questionnaire (on such form as shall be provided by the secretary) that is
accurate as at the record date for such meeting.

 



 

For the purpose of Article 106, where a request(s) in respect of a general
meeting is made by more than one member, references to a member in relation to
notice and other information requirements shall apply to each member,
respectively, as the context requires.

 



 

107. If a request made in accordance with Article 106 does not include the information specified in that Article, or if a request made in accordance with Article 106 is not received in the time and manner indicated in Article 108, in respect of the shares which the relevant member(s) hold (the **_member default shares_** ), the board may in its absolute discretion determine that the relevant member(s) shall not be entitled to vote, either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares (or at an adjournment of any such meeting), the member default shares with respect to the matters detailed in the request made in accordance with Article 106.

 



 

108. Without prejudice to the rights of any member under the Act, a member who makes a request to which Article 106 relates, must deliver any such request in writing to the secretary at the office not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) calendar day nor later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding years annual general meeting, provided, however, that if the date of an annual meeting is more than thirty (30) calendar days before or more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of the first anniversary of the preceding years annual general meeting, notice by the member must be so delivered in writing not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to such annual general meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to such annual general meeting, and (ii) the 10th calendar day after the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual general meeting is first made by the Company. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual general meeting or the public announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a members notice as described in this Article 108.

 



 

For the purposes of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in
[2016], references in this Article 108 to the Companys "preceding years
annual general meeting" shall be construed as references to the annual general
meeting of the Company held in [2015].

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Article 108 to
the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
board is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming
all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board
of directors made by the Company at least one hundred (100) calendar days
prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
general meeting, a members notice required by this Article 108 shall also be
considered as validly delivered in accordance with Article 108, but only with
respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it
shall be delivered to the secretary at the office not later than 5:00 p.m.,
local time, on the tenth (10th) calendar day after the day on which such
public announcement is first made by the Company.

 



 

For the purposes of this Article 108, **_public announcement_** shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by Reuters, the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or a comparable

 



      
 

 



 

news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the SEC
pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 106 or Article 107 or the foregoing
provisions of this Article 108, a member shall also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Statutes and of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in Article 106 or
Article 107 and this Article 108 provided, however, that any references in the
Articles to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements of these
Articles applicable to member requests. Nothing in Article 106 or Article 107
or this Article 108 shall be deemed to affect any rights of members to request
inclusion of proposals in, nor the right of the Company to omit proposals
from, the Companys proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor
provision) under the Exchange Act, subject in each case to compliance with the
Exchange Act.

 



 

109. Without prejudice to the rights of a member to (i) call a general meeting for the purposes of bringing a resolution before the meeting, or (ii) give notice of a resolution to be proposed at a general meeting, either in accordance with the Act or Article 106, the board may in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time adopt, modify or rescind a policy allowing eligible members (as determined pursuant to such policy), subject to the terms and conditions of such policy, to include in the Companys proxy materials under the Exchange Act for an annual general meeting such members nominees for appointment or reappointment to the board and such members resolution or resolutions with respect to such appointment or reappointment to be proposed at such annual general meeting.

 



 

110. The board or the chairman of the board may, if the facts warrant, determine that a notice or request received by the Company relating to a nomination proposed to be made or an item of business proposed to be introduced at a general meeting does not meet the requirements of Articles 106 and 108. The board or the chairman of the applicable general meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any other business brought before a general meeting was brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Articles 106 and 108, and, if such nomination or other business is determined not to have been brought before the meeting in accordance with such procedures, to determine that such defective nomination or proposal shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matters may have been received.

 



 

Any and all such actions, interpretations and determinations that are done or
made by the board, the chairman of the board or any chairman of a general
meeting in good faith pursuant to this Article 110 shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Company, the members and all other parties.

 



 

 ** _VOTES OF MEMBERS_**

 



 

111. Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a vote on a resolution on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.

 



 

112. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the Register in respect of the joint holding.

 



 

113. A member in respect of whom an order has been made by a court or official having jurisdiction (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder may vote by his receiver, _curator bonis_ or other person authorised for that purpose appointed by that court or official. That receiver, _curator bonis_ or other person may vote by

 



      
 

 



 

proxy. The right to vote shall be exercisable only if evidence satisfactory to
the board of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to
vote has been delivered to the office, or another place specified in
accordance with these Articles for the delivery of proxy appointments, not
less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or
adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised provided that
the Company may specify, in any case, that in calculating the period of 48
hours, no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working
day.

 



 

114. No member shall, unless the board otherwise determines, be entitled to vote at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all monies presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid.

 



 

115. If at any time the board is satisfied that any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in shares held by such member, has been duly served with a notice under section 793 of the Act (a **_section 793 notice_** ) and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information thereby required, or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement or given information which is false or inadequate in a material particular, then the board may, in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a **_direction notice_** ) to such member direct that:

 



 

(a) in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred (the
**_default shares_** , which expression includes any shares issued after the
date of the section 793 notice in respect of those shares) the member shall
not be entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general
meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares or on
a poll or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to
any such meeting or poll;

 



 

(b) in respect of the default shares:

 



 

(i) no payment shall be made by way of dividend or distribution (or any other
amount payable in respect of the default shares) and the Company shall not be
required to pay interest in respect of any such amounts not paid;

 



 

(ii) no transfer of any default share shall be registered unless:

 



 

(A) the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information
requested and the transfer when presented for registration is accompanied by a
certificate by the member in such form as the board may in its absolute
discretion require to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the member
is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such information
is interested in any of the shares the subject of the transfer and that none
of the shares the subject of the transfer are default shares; or

 



 

(B) the transfer is an approved transfer; and/or

 



 

(iii) in respect of any shares held in uncertificated form, such shares be
converted into certificated form (and the board shall be entitled to direct
the Operator of any Relevant System applicable to those shares to effect that
conversion immediately) and that member shall not after that be entitled to
convert all or any shares held by him into uncertificated form (except with
the authority of the board),

 



 

(and, for the purposes of ensuring this Article 115(b) can apply to all shares
held by the holder, the Company may, in accordance with the Regulations, issue
a written notification to the Operator requiring the conversion into
certificated form of any shares held by the holder in uncertificated form).

 



      
 

 



 

116. The Company shall send the direction notice to each other person appearing to be interested in the default shares, but the failure or omission by the Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice.

 



 

117. Any direction notice shall cease to have effect not more than seven days after the earlier of receipt by the Company of:

 



 

(a) a notice of an approved transfer, but only in relation to the shares
transferred; or

 



 

(b) all the information required by the relevant section 793 notice, in a form
satisfactory to the board and with the board being reasonably satisfied that
such information is complete and accurate.

 



 

118. The board may at any time withdraw a direction notice, in whole or in part, or suspend in whole or in part, the imposition of any restrictions contained in the direction notice for a given period by serving on the holder of the default shares a notice in writing to that effect (a **_withdrawal notice_** ).

 



 

119. Unless and until a withdrawal notice is duly served in relation thereto or a direction notice in relation thereto is deemed to have been withdrawn, suspended or varied or the shares to which a direction notice relates are transferred by means of an approved transfer, the sanctions referred to in Article 115 shall continue to apply.

 



 

120. The Company may exercise any of its powers under Article 13 in respect of any default share that is held in uncertificated form.

 



 

121. For the purposes of this Article 121 and Articles 115 to 120:

 



 

(a) a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any shares if
the member holding such shares has sent to the Company a notification under
section 793 of the Act which names such person as being so interested or if
the Company (after taking into account information obtained from the member
and from any other relevant section 793 notification) knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the person in question is or may be interested in the
shares;

 



 

(b) " **interested** " shall be construed as it is for the purposes of section
793 of the Act;

 



 

(c) the prescribed period is 14 days from the date of service of the section
793 notice; and

 



 

(d) a transfer of shares is an approved transfer if:

 



 

(i) it is a transfer of shares pursuant to an acceptance of a takeover offer
(within the meaning of section 974 of the Act);

 



 

(ii) the board is satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of
the whole of the beneficial ownership of the shares the subject of the
transfer to a party unconnected with the member and with any other person
appearing to be interested in the shares; or

 



 

(iii) the transfer results from a sale made through NYSE or any recognised
investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000) or any other stock exchange outside the United Kingdom on which the
Companys shares are normally traded.

 



 

122. Nothing contained in Articles 115 to 121 limits the power of the Company under section 794 of the Act.

 



 

123. If any votes are counted which ought not to have been counted, or might have been rejected, the error shall not vitiate the result of the voting unless it is pointed out at the same meeting,

 



      
 

 



 

or at any adjournment of the meeting, and, in the opinion of the chairman, it
is of sufficient magnitude to vitiate the result of the voting.

 



 

124. No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll at which the vote objected to is tendered. Every vote not disallowed at such meeting shall be valid and every vote not counted which ought to have been counted shall be disregarded. Any objection made in due time shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

125. On a poll, a member entitled to more than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.

 



 

 ** _NOTIFICATION OF INTERESTS IN SHARES_**

 



 

126. For the purposes of Article 127 through Article 139:

 



 

 _(a)_ **_Relevant Share Capital_** means any class of the Companys issued
share capital carrying rights to vote in all circumstances at general meetings
of the Company; and for the avoidance of doubt (a) where the Companys share
capital is divided into different classes of shares, references to Relevant
Share Capital are to each such class taken separately and (b) any adjustment
to or restriction on the voting rights attached to shares shall not affect the
application of this Article 126 in relation to interests in those or any other
shares; and

 



 

 _(b)_ **_interested_** shall be construed as it is for the purposes of
section 793 of the Act.

 



 

127. The provisions of Article 126 through Article 139 are in addition to and separate from any other rights or obligations arising at law or otherwise.

 



 

128. A member other than a Depositary holding Relevant Share Capital for the purpose of enabling any shares or other securities of the Company to be traded in uncertificated form shall notify the Company of his interests (if any) in Relevant Share Capital if:

 



 

(a) he has a notifiable interest immediately after the relevant time, but did
not have such an interest immediately before that time;

 



 

(b) he had a notifiable interest immediately before the relevant time, but
does not have such an interest immediately after it; or

 



 

(c) he had a notifiable interest immediately before the relevant time, and has
such an interest immediately after it, but the percentage levels of his
interest immediately before and immediately after that time are not the same.

 



 

129. A member, other than a Depositary holding Relevant Share Capital (i) for the purpose of enabling any shares or other securities of the Company to be traded in uncertificated form or (ii) on behalf of the [S Shareholders], shall, to the extent he is lawfully able to do so, notify the Company of the interests of any other person in the Relevant Share Capital of which he is the registered holder (or, to the extent he is not lawfully able to make such notification, shall use his reasonable endeavours to procure that such person makes notification of his interests to the Company) if:

 



 

(a) such person has a notifiable interest immediately after the relevant time,
but did not have such an interest immediately before that time;

 



 

(b) such person had a notifiable interest immediately before the relevant
time, but does not have such an interest immediately after it; or

 



       
 

 



 

(c) such person had a notifiable interest immediately before the relevant
time, and has such an interest immediately after it, but the percentage levels
of his interest immediately before and immediately after that time are not the
same.

 



 

130. The expression **_percentage level_** in Article 128(c) and 129(c), means the percentage figure found by expressing the aggregate nominal value of all the shares comprised in the Relevant Share Capital concerned in which the person has interests immediately before or (as the case may be) immediately after the relevant time as a percentage of the aggregate nominal value of that Relevant Share Capital and rounding that figure down, if it is not a whole number, to the next whole number. Where the aggregate nominal value of the Relevant Share Capital is greater immediately after the relevant time than it was immediately before, the percentage level of the persons interest immediately before (as well as immediately after) that time shall be determined by reference to the larger amount.

 



 

131. For the purposes of Article 128, 129 and 130:

 



 

(a) relevant time means:

 



 

(i) the time at which:

 



 

(A) a person acquires an interest in shares comprised in Relevant Share
Capital;

 



 

(B) a person ceases to be interested in shares comprised in Relevant Share
Capital; or

 



 

(C) another change of circumstances affecting facts relevant to the
application of this Article 131 occurs,

 



 

in each case provided that the person is aware of such acquisition, cessation
or change in circumstances at the time it occurs; and

 



 

(ii) where a person is not so aware, the time at which:

 



 

(A) that person becomes aware that he has acquired an interest in shares
comprised in Relevant Share Capital; or

 



 

(B) that person becomes aware that he has ceased to be interested in shares
comprised in Relevant Share Capital; or

 



 

(C) that person otherwise becomes aware of any facts relevant to the
application of this Article 131 (whether or not arising from a change of
circumstances); and

 



 

(b) a person who is interested in shares comprised in Relevant Share Capital
has a **_notifiable interest_** at any time when the aggregate nominal value
of the shares in the Relevant Share Capital in which he has such interests is
equal to or more than 3 per cent. of the aggregate nominal value of that
Relevant Share Capital.

 



 

132. Any notification required by to be made by a member under Article 128 and Article 129 must be made in writing to the Company within the period of two (2) days next following the day on which that obligation arises. To the extent a member is not lawfully able to make a notification under Article 129, such member shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the relevant person notifies his interests to the Company within such two (2) day period or within such longer period as the Directors may allow.

 



 

133. The notification shall specify the share capital of the Company to which it relates, and must also:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) state the number of shares comprised in that share capital in which the
person making the notification knows he (or any other relevant person) had
interests immediately after the time when the obligation arose; or

 



 

(b) in a case where the person making the notification (or any other relevant
person) no longer has a notifiable interest in shares comprised in that share
capital, state that he (or that other person) no longer has that interest.

 



 

134. A notification (other than one stating that a person no longer has a notifiable interest) shall include the following particulars, so far as known to the person making the notification at the date when it is made:

 



 

(a) the identity of each registered holder of shares to which the notification
relates and the number of such shares held by each of them; and

 



 

(b) the nature of the relevant interests in such shares.

 



 

135. A person other than a Depositary holding Relevant Share Capital for the purpose of enabling any shares or other securities of the Company to be traded in uncertificated form who has an interest in shares comprised in Relevant Share Capital or knows or becomes aware that any other person has an interest in shares so comprised of which he is the registered holder, that interest being notifiable, shall notify (or, to the extent he is not lawfully able to make such notification, shall use his reasonable endeavours to procure that such other person shall notify) the Company in writing:

 



 

(a) of any particulars in relation to those shares which are specified in
Article 134; and

 



 

(b) of any change in those particulars,

 



 

of which, in either case, he becomes aware at any time after any interest
notification date and before the first occasion following that date on which
he comes under any further obligation of disclosure with respect to his
interest in shares comprised in that share capital. A notification required
under this Article 135 shall be made within the period of two (2) days next
following the day on which it arises. The reference to an **_interest
notification date_** , in relation to a persons interest in shares comprised
in the Companys Relevant Share Capital, is to either (i) the date of any
notification made or procured by him with respect to his or any other persons
interest under this Article 135 or (ii) where he has failed to make, or
procure the making of, a notification, the date on which the period allowed
for making it came to an end.

 



 

136. A person who at any time has a notifiable interest in shares is to be regarded under Article 135 as continuing to have a notifiable interest in them unless and until the registered holder of the shares in question comes under an obligation to make or use his reasonable endeavours to procure a notification stating that he (or any other relevant person) no longer has such an interest in those shares.

 



 

137. Where a person authorises another (the _agent_ ) to acquire or dispose of, on his behalf, interests in shares comprised in the Relevant Share Capital, he shall secure that the agent notifies him immediately of acquisitions or disposals effected by the agent which will or may give rise to any obligation of disclosure imposed on him by this Article 137 with respect to his interest in that share capital.

 



 

138. If it shall come to the notice of the board that any member has not, within the requisite period, made or, as the case may be, procured the making of any notification required by Article 128, Article 129 or Article 135, the Company may (in the absolute discretion of the board) at any time thereafter give notice to such member and such notice shall have the same contents and effect, and be subject to the same provisions of these Articles as if it were a direction notice

 



      
 

 



 

given under Article 115, provided that the provisions of Article 115(b)(ii)
shall not apply to any shares subject to such a direction notice.

 



 

139. For the purposes of this Article 139, Article 128, Article 129 or Article 135, a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any shares if the member holding such shares has given to the Company a notification whether following service of a notice in accordance with the Act or otherwise which either:

 



 

(a) names such person as being so interested; or

 



 

(b) (after taking into account any such notification and any other relevant
information in the possession of the Company) the Company knows or has
reasonable cause to believe that the person in question is or may be
interested in the shares.

 



 

 ** _PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES_**

 



 

140. Invitations to appoint a proxy (whether made by instrument in writing, in electronic form or by website communication) shall be in any usual form as contemplated by these Articles or as the board may otherwise approve. Invitations to appoint a proxy shall be sent or made available by the Company to all persons entitled to notice of and to attend and vote at any meeting. The accidental omission to send or make available an invitation to appoint a proxy or the non-receipt thereof by any member entitled to attend and vote at a meeting shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

 



 

141. The appointment of a proxy shall be:

 



 

(a) in the case of a proxy relating to shares in the capital of the Company
held in the name of a Depositary, in a form or manner of communication
approved by the board, which may include, without limitation, a voter
instruction form to be provided to the Company by certain third parties on
behalf of the Depositary. Subject thereto, the appointment of a proxy may be:

 



 

(A) in hard copy form; or

 



 

(B) in electronic form, to the electronic address provided by the Company for
this purpose; or

 



 

(b) in the case of a proxy relating to shares to which Article 141(a) does not
apply:

 



 

(i) in any usual form or in any other form or manner of communication which
the board may approve. Subject thereto, the appointment of a proxy may be:

 



 

(A) in hard copy form; or

 



 

(B) in electronic form, to the electronic address provided by the Company for
this purpose.

 



 

142. The appointment of a proxy, whether made in hard copy form or in electronic form, shall be executed in such manner as may be approved by or on behalf of the Company from time to time. Subject thereto, the appointment of a proxy shall be executed by the appointor or any person duly authorised by the appointor or, if the appointor is a corporation, executed by a duly authorised person or under its common seal or in any other manner authorised by its constitution.

 



 

143. The board may, if it thinks fit, but subject to the provisions of the Statutes, at the Companys expense send hard copy forms of proxy for use at the meeting and issue invitations in electronic form to appoint a proxy in relation to the meeting in such form as may be approved by the board. The appointment of a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting or poll concerned. A member may appoint more than one

 



      
 

 



 

proxy to attend on the same occasion, provided that each such proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held
by that member.

 



 

144. Without prejudice to Article 89(b) or to the third sentence of Article 100, the appointment of a proxy shall:

 



 

(a) if in hard copy form, be delivered by hand or by post to the office or
such other place within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf
of the Company for that purpose:

 



 

(i) in the notice convening the meeting; or

 



 

(ii) in any form of proxy sent by or on behalf of the Company in relation to
the meeting, by the time specified by the board (as the board may determine,
in compliance with the provisions of the Act) in any such notice or form of
proxy.

 



 

(b) if in electronic form, be received at any address to which the appointment
of a proxy may be sent by electronic means pursuant to a provision of the
Statutes or to any other address specified by or on behalf of the Company for
the purpose of receiving the appointment of a proxy in electronic form:

 



 

(i) in the notice convening the meeting;

 



 

(ii) in any form of proxy sent by or on behalf of the Company in relation to
the meeting;

 



 

(iii) in any invitation to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation
to the meeting; or

 



 

(iv) on a website that is maintained by or on behalf of the Company and
identifies the Company,

 



 

by the time specified by the board (as the board may determine, in compliance
with the provisions of the Statutes) in any such method of notification. The
board may specify, when determining the dates by which proxies are to be
lodged, that no account need be taken of any part of a day that is not a
working day.

 



 

145. Any means of appointing a proxy which is authorised by or under this Article 145 shall be subject to any terms, limitations, conditions or restrictions that the board may from time to time prescribe. Without limiting the foregoing, in relation to any shares which are held in uncertificated form, the board may from time to time permit appointments of a proxy to be made by means of an electronic communication in the form of an Uncertificated Proxy Instruction, and received by such participant in the Relevant System concerned acting on behalf of the Company as the board may prescribe, in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as may from time to time be prescribed by the board (subject always to the facilities and requirements of the Relevant System concerned), and may in a similar manner permit supplements to, or amendments or revocations of, any such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction to be made by like means. The board may in addition prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such properly authenticated dematerialised instruction (and/or other instruction or notification) is to be treated as received by the Company or such participant. The board may treat any such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a holder of a share as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending that instruction to send it on behalf of that holder.

 



 

146. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, where the appointment of a proxy is expressed to have been or purports to have been made, sent or supplied by a person on behalf of the holder of a share:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) the Company may treat the appointment as sufficient evidence of the
authority of that person to make, send or supply the appointment on behalf of
that holder; and

 



 

(b) that holder shall, if requested by or on behalf of the Company at any
time, send or procure the sending of reasonable evidence of the authority
under which the appointment has been made, sent or supplied (which may
include, without limitation, a copy of such authority certified notarially or
in some other way approved by the board), to such address and by such time as
may be specified in the request and, if the request is not complied with in
any respect, the appointment may be treated as invalid.

 



 

147. Subject to Article 145, a proxy appointment which is not delivered or received in accordance with Article 144 shall be invalid. When two or more valid proxy appointments are delivered or received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting, the one that was last delivered or received shall be treated as replacing or revoking the others as regards that share, provided that if the Company determines that it has insufficient evidence to decide whether or not a proxy appointment is in respect of the same share, it shall be entitled to determine which proxy appointment (if any) is to be treated as valid. Subject to the Statutes, the Company may determine at its discretion when a proxy appointment shall be treated as delivered or received for the purposes of these Articles.

 



 

148. A proxy appointment shall be deemed to entitle the proxy to exercise all or any of the appointing members rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the Company in respect of the shares to which the proxy appointment relates. The proxy appointment shall, unless it provides to the contrary, be valid for any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to which it relates.

 



 

149. The Company shall not be required to check that a proxy or corporate representative votes in accordance with any instructions given by the member by whom he is appointed. Any failure to vote as instructed shall not invalidate the proceedings on the resolution.

 



 

150. Any corporation which is a member of the Company (in this Article 150 the **_grantor_** ) may, by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A director, the secretary or other person authorised for the purpose by the secretary may require all or any of such persons to produce a certified copy of the resolution of authorisation before permitting him to exercise his powers. Such person is entitled to exercise (on behalf of the grantor) the same powers as the grantor could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company. Where a grantor authorises more than one person to exercise a power in respect of the same shares and more than one such person exercises such power:

 



 

(a) if they purport to exercise the power in the same way as each other, the
power is treated as exercised in that way; and

 



 

(b) if they do not purport to exercise the power in the same way as each
other, the power is treated as not exercised.

 



 

151. The termination of the authority of a person to act as a proxy or duly authorised representative of a corporation does not affect:

 



 

(a) whether he counts in deciding whether there is a quorum at a meeting;

 



 

(b) the validity of anything he does as chairman of a meeting;

 



 

(c) the validity of a poll demanded by him at a meeting; or

 



 

(d) the validity of a vote given by that person,

 



      
 

 



 

unless notice of the termination was either delivered or received as mentioned
in the following sentence at least 24 hours before the start of the relevant
meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on
the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for
taking the poll. Such notice of termination shall be either by means of a
document in hard copy form delivered to the office or to such other place
within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company
in accordance with Article 144(a) or in electronic form received at the
address specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article
144(b), regardless of whether any relevant proxy appointment was effected in
hard copy form or in electronic form.

 



 

152. A proxy given in the form of a power of attorney or similar authorisation granting power to a person to vote on behalf of a member at forthcoming meetings in general shall not be treated as valid for a period of more than twelve (12) months, unless a contrary intention is stated in it.

 



 

 ** _NUMBER OF DIRECTORS_**

 



 

153. The number of directors shall be as the board may determine from time to time, but shall be not less than three (3) and no more than fifteen (15).

 



 

154. If the number of directors is reduced below the minimum number fixed in accordance with these Articles, the directors for the time being may act for the purpose of filling vacancies in their number or of calling a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose. If there are no directors willing to act, then any two members may summon a general meeting for the purpose of appointing directors.

 



 

 ** _APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS_**

 



 

155. Subject to Article 156 and the Shareholders Agreement being in full force and effect, the Company shall (if designated by Capricorn under the Shareholders Agreement) cause the board to include:

 



 

(a) two Capricorn Directors from the date of adoption of these Articles until
the earlier of (i) the first date that the [S Shareholders], in the aggregate,
cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least ten per cent.
(10%) of the outstanding Voting Securities, and (ii) the termination of the
Shareholders Agreement; and

 



 

(b) one Capricorn Director from the first date that the [S Shareholders], in
the aggregate, cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least ten
per cent. (10%) until the earlier of (i) the first date that the [S
Shareholders], in the aggregate, cease to beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, at least five per cent. (5%) of the outstanding Voting Securities,
and (ii) the termination of the Shareholders Agreement,

 



 

provided that, in each case, each such Capricorn Director shall qualify as an
Independent Director (except as set out in the Shareholders Agreement) and
satisfy any other eligibility criteria contained in the Shareholders
Agreement, the Statutes, these Articles or any other applicable laws and
regulations.

 



 

156. Notwithstanding Article 155, prior to the earlier of (i) the first date that the [S Shareholders], in the aggregate, cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least five per cent. (5%) of the outstanding Voting Securities, and (ii) the termination of the Shareholders Agreement, Capricorn shall be entitled to appoint and remove a director appointed as a Capricorn Director, subject to any eligibility criteria in the Shareholders Agreement, the requirements of the NYSE, SEC and any other applicable laws and regulations. Any such appointment or removal of a Capricorn Director by Capricorn shall be made by notice in writing to the Company and such appointment or removal shall have effect from the later of the date of delivery of any such notice and the date (if any) specified for this

 



      
 

 



 

purpose in any such notice. Upon the termination of the Shareholders Agreement
or at any other time that the number of Capricorn Directors is greater than
that which Capricorn is entitled to appoint pursuant to Article 155 and the
Shareholders Agreement (the **_Trigger Date_** ), Capricorn shall promptly, or
immediately in the event of termination of the Shareholders Agreement, remove
or procure the resignation of the relevant number of Capricorn Directors from
the board so as to cause the number of directors then appointed by Capricorn
to correspond with the number of directors that Capricorn is entitled to
appoint pursuant to Article 155 and the Shareholders Agreement (the
**_Required Reduction_** ). Except in the event of termination of the
Shareholders Agreement, where the Required Reduction shall be all Capricorn
Directors, if at the time of any Required Reduction there is more than one
Capricorn Director, Capricorn shall determine which Capricorn Director shall
be so removed or resign. If Capricorn has not removed or procured the
resignation of the requisite number of Capricorn Directors within five days of
the Trigger Date, or immediately in the event of termination of the
Shareholders Agreement, Capricorn (and in default of Capricorn acting in
accordance with this provision, the board) shall remove the most recently
appointed Capricorn Director or both Capricorn Directors, as the case may be,
in order to achieve the Required Reduction. Except in the event of termination
of the Shareholders Agreement, if any Capricorn Director is removed from
office otherwise than by notice given pursuant to this Article 156, the board
shall re-appoint such person as a director as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event within two days following such removal under the power
conferred on them in Article 161.

 



 

157. Subject to the foregoing provisions of Articles 153 to 155 and Article 161, the directors shall be elected at each annual general meeting of the Company by ordinary resolution.

 



 

158. Other than pursuant to Article 174 and subject to Article 180, each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected or until his earlier resignation or removal in accordance with Article 156 or pursuant to any of Article 175, Article 177, Article 178 or Article 179, as applicable.

 



 

159. No person shall be appointed a director at any general meeting unless:

 



 

(a) he is recommended by the board or appointed by Capricorn in accordance
with these Articles and the Shareholders Agreement; or

 



 

(b) notice in respect of that person is given by a member qualified to vote at
the meeting in accordance with Article 106 and Article 108 (and, if
applicable, section 338 of the Act) of the intention to propose that person
for appointment stating the particulars which would, if he were so appointed,
be required to be included in the Companys register of directors, and such
notice has been received by the Company together with notice by that person of
his willingness to be appointed.

 



 

160. Except as otherwise authorised by the Statutes, a motion for the appointment of two or more persons as directors by a single resolution shall not be made unless a resolution that it should be so made has first been agreed to by the meeting without any vote being given against it.

 



 

161. Subject to Articles 157 to 159 and Article 162, the Company may by ordinary resolution or by resolution of the board appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. The appointment of a person to fill a vacancy or as an additional director shall take effect from the end of the relevant meeting.

 



 

162. If at a meeting of the Company it is proposed to vote upon a number of resolutions for the appointment of a person as a director (each a **_Director Resolution_** ) that exceeds the total number of directors that may be appointed to the board at that meeting (the **_board Number_** ), the persons that shall be appointed shall first be the person who receives the greatest number

 



      
 

 



 

of "for" votes (whether or not a majority of those votes cast in respect of
that Director Resolution), and then shall second be the person who receives
the second greatest number of "for" votes (whether or not a majority of those
votes cast in respect of that Director Resolution), and so on, until the
number of directors so appointed equals the board Number, provided that this
Article 162 shall not operate in any manner that is contrary to the rights of
Capricorn to appoint a Capricorn Director in accordance with Articles 155 and
156.

 



 

163. Article 162 shall not apply to any resolution proposed to be voted on at a meeting in respect of the proposed removal of an existing director and appointment of a person instead of the person so removed, which pursuant to Article 179 and the Act shall be proposed as an ordinary resolution.

 



 

164. Subject to the rights of Capricorn to appoint a Capricorn Director in accordance with Articles 155 and 156, the board may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional director, but so that the total number of directors shall not at any time exceed the maximum number fixed by these Articles. Any director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following annual general meeting, and shall then be eligible for election, or until his earlier resignation or removal in accordance with Article 162, Article 175, Article 177, Article 178 or Article 179.

 



 

165. A director shall not be required to hold any shares in the capital of the Company by way of qualification.

 



 

 ** _POWERS OF THE BOARD_**

 



 

166. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes and these Articles and any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the board, which may pay all expenses incurred in forming and registering the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company, including without limitation the power to dispose of all or any part of the undertaking of the Company. No alteration of the Articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the board which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given. The powers given by this Article 166 shall not be limited by any special power given to the board by these Articles. A meeting of the board at which a quorum is present may exercise all powers exercisable by the board.

 



 

167. The board may exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any body corporate held or owned by the Company in such manner in all respects as it thinks fit (including without limitation the exercise of that power in favour of any resolution appointing its members or any of them directors of such body corporate, or voting or providing for the payment of remuneration to the directors of such body corporate).

 



 

 ** _BORROWING POWERS_**

 



 

168. Subject as provided in these Articles, the board may exercise all of the powers of the Company to borrow money, to indemnify and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital or parts thereof, and, subject to the Statutes, to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.

 



 

 ** _CHANGE OF THE COMPANY S NAME_**

 



 

169. The Companys name may be changed by resolution of the board.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _DELEGATION OF POWERS OF THE BOARD_**

 



 

170. The board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of one or more directors. The board may also delegate to any director holding any executive office such of its powers as the board considers desirable to be exercised by him. Any such delegation shall, in the absence of express provision to the contrary in the terms of delegation, be deemed to include authority to sub-delegate to one or more directors (whether or not acting as a committee) or to any employee or agent of the Company all or any of the powers delegated and may be made subject to such conditions as the board may specify, and may be revoked or altered.

 



 

Subject to any conditions imposed by the board, the proceedings of a committee
with two or more members shall be governed by these Articles regulating the
proceedings of directors so far as they are capable of applying.

 



 

171. The board may establish local or divisional boards or agencies for managing any of the affairs of the Company, either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and may appoint any persons to be members of the local or divisional boards, or any managers or agents, and may fix their remuneration. The board may delegate to any local or divisional board, manager or agent any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in or exercisable by the board, with power to sub-delegate, and may authorise the members of any local or divisional board, or any of them, to fill any vacancies and to act notwithstanding vacancies. Any appointment or delegation made pursuant to this Article 171 may be made on such terms and subject to such conditions as the board may decide. The board may remove any person so appointed and may revoke or vary the delegation but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of the revocation or variation shall be affected by it.

 



 

172. The board may, by power of attorney or otherwise, appoint any person to be the agent of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the board) and for such period and on such conditions as the board determines, including without limitation authority for the agent to delegate all or any of his powers, authorities and discretions, and may revoke or vary such delegation.

 



 

173. The board may appoint any person to any office or employment having a designation or title including the word "director" or attach to any existing office or employment with the Company such a designation or title and may terminate any such appointment or the use of any such designation or title. The inclusion of the word "director" in the designation or title of any such office or employment shall not imply that the holder is a director of the Company, and the holder shall not thereby be empowered in any respect to act as, or be deemed to be, a director of the Company for any of the purposes of these Articles.

 



 

 ** _FIXED TERM DIRECTORS_**

 



 

174. Directors, other than any Capricorn Director, may be appointed to serve for a fixed term following which that director shall retire.

 



 

175. A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election. If he is not re-elected or deemed to be re-elected, he shall hold office until the next annual general meeting elects someone in his place or, if it does not do so, until the end of that meeting.

 



 

176. If the Company at the meeting at which a director retires does not fill the vacancy, the retiring director shall, if willing to act, be deemed to have been reappointed unless at the meeting it is resolved not to fill the vacancy or unless a resolution for the reappointment of the director is put to the meeting and not passed.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _RESIGNATION, DISQUALIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS_**

 



 

177. A director may resign his office either by notice in writing submitted to the board or, if he shall in writing offer to resign, if the other directors resolve to accept such offer.

 



 

178. A person ceases to be a director as soon as:

 



 

(a) that person ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the
Statutes or is prohibited from being a director by law or, if applicable, any
provisions of the rules of the NYSE;

 



 

(b) a bankruptcy order is made against that person;

 



 

(c) a composition is made with that persons creditors generally in
satisfaction of that persons debts;

 



 

(d) a registered medical practitioner who is treating that person gives a
written opinion to the Company stating that that person has become physically
or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than
three months;

 



 

(e) by reason of that persons health, a court makes an order which wholly or
partly prevents that person from personally exercising any powers or rights
which that person would otherwise have;

 



 

(f) that person is absent from meetings of the board for six consecutive
months without permission of the board and the board resolves that his office
be vacated;

 



 

(g) that person dies; or

 



 

(h) the board gives notice to such person that it has resolved that such
person shall cease to be a director.

 



 

179. Subject to the rights of Capricorn to appoint a Capricorn Director in accordance with Articles 155 and 156, the Company may, without prejudice to the provisions of the Statutes, by ordinary resolution remove any director from office (notwithstanding any provision of these Articles or of any agreement between the Company and such director, but without prejudice to any claim he may have for damages for breach of any such agreement). No special notice need be given of any resolution to remove a director in accordance with this Article 179 and no director proposed to be removed in accordance with this Article 179 has any special right to protest against his removal. The Company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint another person in place of a director removed from office in accordance with this Article 179.

 



 

180. Articles 178(h) and 179 shall not apply to any Capricorn Director except as contemplated by Article 156\. The directors shall exercise their powers pursuant to Article 178(h) as necessary so as to create any vacancy required to enable Capricorn to exercise its appointment rights pursuant to Article 156.

 



 

 ** _NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS_**

 



 

181. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may enter into, vary and terminate an agreement or arrangement with any director who does not hold executive office for the provision of his services to the Company. Any such agreement or arrangement may be made on such terms as the board determines, provided that the terms of any such agreement or arrangement would not result in non-compliance with any listing requirements of the NYSE in accordance with the NYSE Manual.

 



 

182. Each non-executive director shall be paid a fee for their services (which shall be deemed to accrue from day to day) at such rate as may from time to time be determined by the board,

 



       
 

 



 

provided that the agreement or payment of any such fee would not result in
non-compliance with any listing requirements of the NYSE in accordance with
the NYSE Manual.

 



 

183. Any director who does not hold executive office with the Company and who performs special services which in the opinion of the board are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director, may be paid such extra remuneration by way of additional fee, salary, commission or otherwise as the board may determine, provided the payment of any such extra remuneration would not result in non-compliance with any listing requirements of the NYSE in accordance with the NYSE Manual.

 



 

 ** _DIRECTORS  EXPENSES_**

 



 

184. The directors may be paid all reasonable travelling, hotel, and other expenses properly incurred by them in connection with their attendance at meetings of the board or committees of the board, general meetings or separate meetings of the holders of any class of shares or of debentures of the Company or otherwise in connection with the discharge of their duties as a director.

 



 

 ** _EXECUTIVE OFFICERS_**

 



 

185. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may appoint one or more of its body or any other employee of the Company to be the holder of any executive office (including, without limitation, to hold office as president, chief executive officer and/or treasurer, but excluding that of auditor) in the Company and may enter into an agreement or arrangement with any such director or employee for his employment by the Company or for the provision by him of any services outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director or employee. Any such appointment, agreement or arrangement may be made on such terms, including without limitation terms as to remuneration, as the board determines, provided that the terms of any such agreement or arrangement would not result in non-compliance with any listing requirements of the NYSE in accordance with the NYSE Manual. The board may revoke or vary any such appointment but without prejudice to any rights or claims which the person whose appointment is revoked or varied may have against the Company because of the revocation or variation.

 



 

186. Any appointment of a director to an executive office shall terminate if he ceases to be a director but without prejudice to any rights or claims which he may have against the Company by reason of such cessation. A director appointed to an executive office shall not be exempt from retirement by rotation, and if he ceases for any reason to hold the executive office by virtue of which he is termed an executive director, he shall offer to resign as a director in accordance with Article 177 and he shall cease to be a director if the other directors resolve to accept such offer.

 



 

187. The emoluments of any director or employee holding executive office for his services as such shall be determined by the board, provided that the terms of any such agreement or arrangement would not result in non-compliance with any listing requirements of the NYSE in accordance with the NYSE Manual and may be of any description, including without limitation admission to, or continuance of, membership of any scheme (including any share acquisition scheme) or fund instituted or established or financed or contributed to by the Company for the provision of pensions, life assurance or other benefits for employees or their dependants, or the payment of a pension or other benefits to him or his dependants on or after retirement or death, apart from membership of any such scheme or fund.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _DIRECTORS  INTERESTS_**

 



 

188. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, and provided that he has made the disclosures required by Article 189, a director notwithstanding his office may be a party to or otherwise directly or indirectly be interested in:

 



 

(a) any transaction or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is
otherwise interested; or

 



 

(b) a proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company.

 



 

189. A director shall (unless the circumstances referred to in section 177(5) or section 177(6) of the Act apply, in which case no such disclosure is required), be required to disclose all interests whether or not material in any transaction or arrangement referred to in Article 188 and the declaration of interest must (in the case of a transaction or arrangement referred to in Article 188(a)) and may (in the case of a transaction or arrangement referred to in Article 188(b)), but need not, be made:

 



 

(a) at a meeting of the directors; or

 



 

(b) by notice to the directors in accordance with either (i) section 184 of
the Act (notice in writing), or (ii) section 185 of the Act (general notice).

 



 

190. The board may resolve that any situation referred to in Article 188 and disclosed to them under Article 189 shall also be subject to such terms as they may determine including, without limitation, the terms referred to in Articles 193(a) to 193(c).

 



 

191. For the purposes of section 175 of the Act, the board may authorise any matter proposed to it in accordance with these Articles which would, if not so authorised, involve a breach of duty by a director under that section, including, without limitation, any matter which relates to a situation in which a director has, or can have, an interest which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company. Any such authorisation will be effective only if:

 



 

(a) the matter in question shall have been proposed in writing (giving full
particulars of the relevant situation) for consideration at a meeting of the
board, in accordance with the boards normal procedures or in such other
manner as the board may approve;

 



 

(b) any requirement as to quorum at the meeting of the board at which the
matter is considered is met without counting the director in question or any
other interested director; and

 



 

(c) the matter was agreed to without the interested directors voting or would
have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted.

 



 

The board may (whether at the time of the giving of the authorisation or
subsequently) make any such authorisation subject to any limits or conditions
it expressly imposes but such authorisation is otherwise given to the fullest
extent permitted. The board may vary or terminate any such authorisation at
any time.

 



 

For the purposes of these Articles, a conflict of interest includes a conflict
of interest and duty and a conflict of duties, and interest includes both
direct and indirect interests.

 



 

192. Any authorisation of a matter pursuant to Article 191 shall extend to any actual or potential conflict of interest which may reasonably be expected to arise out of the matter so authorised.

 



 

193. Any authorisation of a matter under Article 191 shall be subject to such terms as the board may determine, whether at the time such authorisation is given or (without prejudice to the permissibility of any prior actions of a director that were, at the time they were taken, in accordance with the authorisation as then in force) subsequently, and may be terminated or

 



      
 

 



 

varied by the board at any time. Such terms may include, without limitation,
terms that the relevant directors:

 



 

(a) may be required by the Company to maintain in the strictest confidence any
confidential information relating to the Company which also relates to the
situation as a result of which the conflict arises (the **_conflict
situation_** );

 



 

(b) may be required by the Company not to attend any part of a meeting of the
directors at which any matter which may be relevant to the conflict situation
is to be discussed, and not to view any board papers relating to such matters;
and

 



 

(c) shall not be obliged to account to the Company for any remuneration or
other benefits received by him in consequence of the conflict situation.

 



 

194. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, and provided that he has disclosed to the board the nature and extent of his interest (unless the circumstances referred to in section 177(5) or section 177(6) of the Act apply, in which case no such disclosure is required) a director notwithstanding his office:

 



 

(a) may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction, contract
or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise (directly
or indirectly) interested;

 



 

(b) may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company
(otherwise than as auditor) and he or his firm shall be entitled to
remuneration for professional services as if he were not a director; and

 



 

(c) may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to a
transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any body
corporate:

 



 

(i) in which the Company is (directly or indirectly) interested as a
shareholder or otherwise; or

 



 

(ii) with which he has such a relationship at the request or direction of the
Company.

 



 

195. A director shall not, by reason of his office, be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefit which he (or any person connected with him) derives from any office or employment or from any transaction or arrangement or from any interest in any body corporate:

 



 

(a) the acceptance, entry into or existence of which has been approved by the
board pursuant to Article 191 (subject, in any such case, to any limits or
conditions to which such approval was subject); or

 



 

(b) which he is permitted to hold or enter into by virtue of paragraph (a),
(b) or (c) of Article 194, nor shall the receipt of any such remuneration or
other benefit constitute a breach of his duty under section 176 of the Act.

 



 

196. A director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a director of the Company and in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person. However, to the extent that his relationship with that other person gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, this Article 196 applies only if the existence of that relationship has been approved by the board pursuant to Article 191 (provided that, notwithstanding any other Article, the board shall not be entitled to impose any term on such approval that would be inconsistent with the provisions of this Article 196). In particular, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177 of the Act because he fails:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) to disclose any such information to the board or to any director or other
officer or employee of the Company; and/or

 



 

(b) to use or apply any such information in performing his duties as a
director of the Company.

 



 

197. Where the existence of a directors relationship with another person has been authorised and approved by the board pursuant to Article 191 and his relationship with that person gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177 of the Act because he:

 



 

(a) absents himself from meetings of the board at which any matter relating to
the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be
discussed or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise;
and/or

 



 

(b) makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to
any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict
of interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and
information to be received and read by a professional adviser, for so long as
he reasonably believes such conflict of interest or possible conflict of
interest subsists.

 



 

198. Save as otherwise provided by these Articles, a director shall not vote at a meeting of the board or of any committee of the board or any resolution concerning a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, an interest (other than by virtue of his interest in shares, debentures or other securities of or in or otherwise through the Company) which is material, or a duty which conflicts or can reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict with the interests of the Company, unless his interest or duty arises only because one of the following applies (in which case he may vote and be counted in the quorum):

 



 

(a) the resolution relates to the giving by him or any other person of a
guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of money lent to, or an obligation
incurred by him or by any other person at the request of or for the benefit
of, the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings;

 



 

(b) the resolution relates to the giving to a third party of a guarantee,
security or indemnity in respect of an obligation of the Company or any of its
subsidiary undertakings for which the director has assumed responsibility in
whole or in part and whether alone or jointly with others under a guarantee or
indemnity or by the giving of security;

 



 

(c) his interest arises by virtue of his being, or intending to become, a
participant in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of an offer of any shares,
debentures or other securities by the Company or any of its subsidiary
undertakings for subscription, purchase or exchange;

 



 

(d) the resolution relates to a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal
concerning any other body corporate in which he or any person connected with
him is interested, directly or indirectly, and whether as an officer,
shareholder, creditor or otherwise, if he and any persons connected with him
do not to his knowledge hold an interest (as that term is used in sections 820
to 825 of the Act) representing one per cent. or more of either any class of
the equity share capital of such body corporate (or any other body corporate
through which his interest is derived) or of the voting rights available to
members of the relevant body corporate (any such interest being deemed for the
purpose of this Article 198 to be likely to give rise to a conflict with the
interests of the Company in all circumstances);

 



 

(e) the resolution relates to an arrangement for the benefit of the employees
of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, which does not award him
any

 



      
 

 



 

privilege or benefit not generally awarded to the employees to whom such
arrangement relates;

 



 

(f) the resolution relates to any proposal concerning any insurance which the
Company is empowered to purchase and/or maintain for, or for the benefit of,
any of the directors or for persons who include the directors;

 



 

(g) the resolution relates to a subscription, or an agreement to subscribe,
for shares or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiary
undertakings, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite or guarantee an offer of any
such shares or securities by the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings
for subscription, purchase or exchange;

 



 

(h) the resolution relates to the giving to a director of an indemnity against
liabilities incurred or to be incurred by that director in the execution and
discharge of his duties; or

 



 

(i) the resolution relates to the provision to a director of funds to meet
expenditure incurred or to be incurred by that director in defending criminal
or civil proceedings against him or in connection with any application under
any of the provisions mentioned in section 205(5) of the Act or in respect of
an investigation by any regulatory authority or otherwise enabling him to
avoid incurring that expenditure or relates to entering or performing
obligations under an agreement pursuant to which the Company incurs costs
directly in respect of an action or proceeding taken by a third party against
the director.

 



 

199. The provisions of Articles 196 to 197 are without prejudice to any equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse the director from:

 



 

(a) disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise
be required under these Articles; or

 



 

(b) attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information,
in circumstances where such attendance or receiving such documents and
information would otherwise be required under these Articles.

 



 

200. For the purposes of Articles 188 to 190 inclusive:

 



 

(a) an interest of a person who is, for the purpose of the Act (excluding any
such modification thereof not in force when these Articles became binding on
the Company), connected with a director shall be treated as an interest of the
director; and

 



 

(b) an interest of which a director has no knowledge and of which it is
unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an
interest of his.

 



 

201. The board may exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any company held or owned by the Company in such matter and in all respects as it deems fit (including the exercise thereof in favour of any resolution appointing the directors or any of them directors of such company, or voting or providing for the remuneration to the directors of such company).

 



 

202. A director shall be counted in the quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.

 



 

203. If a question arises at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board as to the rights of a director to vote, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman of the meeting (or if the director concerned is the chairman, to the other directors at

 



      
 

 



 

the meeting) and his ruling in relation to any director (or, as the case may
be, the ruling of the majority of the directors in relation to the chairman)
shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

 ** _GRATUITIES, PENSIONS AND INSURANCE_**

 



 

204. The board may (by establishment of, or maintenance of, schemes or otherwise) provide benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or by insurance or otherwise, for any past or present director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings or any body corporate associated with, or any business acquired by, any of them, and for any member of his family (including a spouse, a civil partner, a former spouse and a former civil partner) or any person who is or was dependent on him, and may (as well before as after he ceases to hold such office or employment) contribute to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of any such benefit.

 



 

205. Subject to the provisions of the Act, and without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 267 to 270, the board may exercise all the powers of the Company to purchase and maintain insurance for or for the benefit of any person who is or was:

 



 

(a) a director, officer or employee of the Company, or any body which is or
was the holding company or subsidiary undertaking of the Company, or in which
the Company or such holding company or subsidiary undertaking has or had any
interest (whether direct or indirect) or with which the Company or such
holding company or subsidiary undertaking is or was in any way allied or
associated; or

 



 

(b) a trustee of any pension fund in which employees of the Company or any
other body referred to in paragraph (a) of this Article 205 are or have been
interested, including, without limitation, insurance against any liability
incurred by such persons in respect of any act or omission in the actual or
purported execution or discharge of their duties or in the exercise or
purported exercise of their powers or otherwise in relation to their duties,
powers or offices in relation to the relevant body or fund.

 



 

206. No director or former director shall be accountable to the Company or the members or liable to account for any benefit provided pursuant to these Articles. The receipt of any such benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a director of the Company.

 



 

207. The board may make provision for the benefit of any persons employed or formerly employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than a director or former director or shadow director in connection with the cessation or the transfer of the whole or part of the undertaking of the Company or any subsidiary. Any such provision shall be made by a resolution of the board in accordance with section 247 of the Act.

 



 

 ** _PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD_**

 



 

208. Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the board may regulate its proceedings as it thinks fit. A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a meeting of the board by giving notice of the meeting to each director. Notice of a board meeting shall be deemed to be given to a director if it is given to him personally or by word of mouth or sent in hard copy form to him at his last known address or such other address (if any) as may for the time being be specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose, or sent in electronic form to such address (if any) for the time being specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose. Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. Any director may waive notice of a meeting and any such waiver may be retrospective. Any notice pursuant to this Article 208 need not be in writing if the board so determines and any such determination may be retrospective.

 



      
 

 



 

209. The quorum for the transaction of the business of the board may be fixed by the board and unless so fixed at any other number shall be a majority of the directors then in office. Any director who ceases to be a director at a board meeting may continue to be present and to act as a director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of the board meeting if no director objects.

 



 

210. The continuing directors or a sole continuing director may act notwithstanding any vacancies in their number, but if the number of directors is less than the number fixed as the quorum the continuing directors or director may act only for the purpose of filling vacancies or of calling a general meeting.

 



 

211. The board may appoint one of their number to be the chairman, and one of their number to be the deputy chairman, of the board and may at any time remove either of them from such office. Unless he is unwilling to do so, the director appointed as chairman, or in his stead the director appointed as deputy chairman, shall preside at every meeting of the board at which he is present. If there is no director holding either of those offices, or if neither the chairman nor the deputy chairman is willing to preside or neither of them is present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, the directors present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

 



 

212. All acts done by a meeting of the board, or of a committee of the board, or by a person acting as a director, shall, as regards all persons dealing in good faith with the Company, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any director or any member of the committee or that any of them were disqualified from holding office, or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a director and had been entitled to vote.

 



 

213. A resolution in writing agreed to by all the directors entitled to vote at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board (not being less than the number of directors required to form a quorum of the board or committee of the board) shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the board or (as the case may be) a committee of the board duly convened and held. For this purpose:

 



 

(a) a director signifies his agreement to a proposed written resolution when
the Company receives from him a document indicating his agreement to the
resolution authenticated in the manner permitted by the Statutes for a
document in the relevant form; and

 



 

(b) the director may send the document in hard copy form or in electronic form
to such address (if any) for the time being specified by the Company for that
purpose.

 



 

214. Without prejudice to the first sentence of Article 208, a person entitled to be present at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board shall be deemed to be present for all purposes if he is able (directly or by electronic communication) to speak to and be heard by all those present or deemed to be present simultaneously. A director so deemed to be present shall be entitled to vote and be counted in a quorum accordingly. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where it is convened to be held or (if no director is present in that place) where the largest group of those participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting is. The word **_meeting_** in these Articles shall be construed accordingly.

 



 

215. The Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to any extent, either generally or in respect of any particular matter, any provision of these Articles prohibiting a director from voting at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board.

 



      
 

 



 

216. Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment (including without limitation fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of two or more directors to offices or employments with the Company or any body corporate in which the Company is interested, the proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director separately. In such cases each of the directors concerned shall be entitled to vote in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own appointment.

 



 

217. If a question arises at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board as to the entitlement of a director to vote, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation to any director other than himself shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of the interests of the director concerned have not been fairly disclosed. If any such question arises in respect of the chairman of the meeting, it shall be decided by resolution of the board (on which the chairman shall not vote) and such resolution will be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature and extent of the interests of the chairman have not been fairly disclosed.

 



 

 ** _SECRETARY_**

 



 

218. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the secretary shall be appointed by the board for such term, at such remuneration and on such conditions as it may think fit. Any secretary so appointed may be removed by the board, but without prejudice to any claim for damages for breach of any contract of service between him and the Company.

 



 

 ** _MINUTES_**

 



 

219. The board shall cause minutes to be recorded for the purpose of:

 



 

(a) all appointments of officers made by the board;

 



 

(b) all proceedings at meetings of the Company, the holders of any class of
shares in the capital of the Company, the board and committees of the board,
including the names of the directors present at each such meeting; and

 



 

(c) all resolutions of the Company.

 



 

220. Any such minutes, if purporting to be authenticated by the chairman of the meeting to which they relate or of the next meeting at which they are read, shall be sufficient evidence of the proceedings at the meeting without any further proof of the facts stated in them.

 



 

221. Any such minutes must be kept for the period specified in the Act.

 



 

 ** _THE SEAL_**

 



 

222. The seal shall only be used by the authority of a resolution of the board. The board may determine who shall sign any document executed under the seal. If they do not, it shall be signed by at least one authorised person in the presence of a witness who attests the signature. Any document may be executed under the seal by impressing the seal by mechanical means or by printing the seal or a facsimile of it on the document or by applying the seal or a facsimile of it by any other means to the document. A document executed, with the authority of a resolution of the board, in any manner permitted by section 44(2) of the Act and expressed (in whatever form of words) to be executed by the Company has the same effect as if executed under the seal.

 



 

223. The board may by resolution determine either generally or in any particular case that any certificate for shares or debentures or representing any other form of security may have any

 



      
 

 



 

signature affixed to it by some mechanical or electronic means, or printed on
it or, in the case of a certificate executed under the seal, need not bear any
signature.

 



 

 ** _REGISTERS_**

 



 

224. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the Company may keep an overseas or local or other register in any place, and the board may make, amend and revoke any regulations it thinks fit about the keeping of that register.

 



 

225. Any director or the secretary or any other person appointed by the board for the purpose shall have power to authenticate and certify as true copies of and extracts from:

 



 

(a) any document comprising or affecting the constitution of the Company,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form;

 



 

(b) any resolution passed by the Company, the holders of any class of shares
in the capital of the Company, the board or any committee of the board,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form; and

 



 

(c) any book, record and document relating to the business of the Company,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form (including without limitation the
accounts).

 



 

If certified in this way, a document purporting to be a copy of a resolution,
or the minutes or an extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Company, the
holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, the board or a
committee of the board, whether in hard copy form or electronic form, shall be
conclusive evidence in favour of all persons dealing with the Company in
reliance on it or them that the resolution was duly passed or that the minutes
are, or the extract from the minutes is, a true and accurate record of
proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

 



 

 ** _DIVIDENDS_**

 



 

226. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the Company may by ordinary resolution declare that out of the profits available for distribution there be paid dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the board.

 



 

227. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, the board may pay interim dividends if it appears to the board that they are justified by the profits of the Company available for distribution and the position of the Company. If the share capital is divided into different classes, the board may:

 



 

(a) pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred
rights with regard to dividends as well as on shares which confer preferential
rights with regard to dividends, but no interim dividend shall be paid on
shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment,
any preferential dividend is in arrears; and

 



 

(b) pay at intervals settled by it any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it
appears to the board that the profits available for distribution justify the
payment.

 



 

If the board acts in good faith it shall not incur any liability to the
holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by
the lawful payment of an interim dividend on any shares having deferred or
non-preferred rights.

 



 

228. Dividends may be declared and paid in any currency or currencies that the board shall determine. The board may also determine the exchange rate and the relevant date for determining the value of the dividend in any currency.

 



      
 

 



 

229. Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid on a share in advance of the date on which a call is payable shall be treated for the purpose of this Article 229 as paid on the share. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid, but, if any share is allotted or issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, that share shall rank for dividend accordingly.

 



 

230. A general meeting declaring a dividend may, on the recommendation of the board, by ordinary resolution direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, including without limitation paid up shares or debentures of another body corporate. If the shares in respect of which any such proposed non-cash distribution is paid are uncertificated, any shares in the Company which are issued as non-cash consideration in respect of them must be uncertificated. The board may make any arrangements it thinks fit to settle any difficulty arising in connection with the distribution, including without limitation (a) the fixing of the value for distribution of any assets, (b) the payment of cash to any member on the basis of that value in order to adjust the rights of members, and (c) the vesting of any asset in a trustee.

 



 

231. The board may deduct from any dividend or other monies payable to any member in respect of a share any monies presently payable by him to the Company in respect of that share. Where a person is entitled by transmission to a share, the board may retain any dividend payable in respect of that share until that person (or that persons transferee) becomes the holder of that share.

 



 

232. Any dividend or other monies payable in respect of a share may be paid:

 



 

(a) in cash; or

 



 

(b) by cheque or warrant made payable to or to the order of the holder or
person entitled to payment; or

 



 

(c) by any direct debit, bank or other funds transfer system to the holder or
person entitled to payment or, if practicable, to a person designated by
notice to the Company by the holder or person entitled to payment;

 



 

(d) if any share is in uncertificated form, where the Company is authorised to
do so by or on behalf of the holder or joint holders in such manner as the
Company shall from time to time consider sufficient, the Company may also pay
any such dividend, interest or other monies by means of the Relevant System
concerned (subject always to the facilities and requirements of the Relevant
System); or

 



 

(e) by any other method approved by the board and agreed (in such form as the
Company thinks appropriate) by the holder or person entitled to payment.

 



 

Without prejudice to paragraph (d) of the foregoing, in respect of any shares
in uncertificated form, such payment may include sending by the Company or any
person on its behalf of an instruction to the Operator of the Relevant System
to credit the cash memorandum account of the holder or joint holders or, if
permitted by the Company, of such person as the holder or joint holders may
direct in writing.

 



 

233. If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any share, or are entitled by transmission jointly to a share, the Company may:

 



 

(a) pay any dividend or other monies payable in respect of the share to any
one of them and any one of them may give effectual receipt for that payment;
and

 



       
 

 



 

(b) for the purpose of Article 232, rely in relation to the share on the
written direction, designation or agreement of, or notice to the Company by,
any one of them.

 



 

234. A cheque or warrant may be sent by post:

 



 

(a) where a share is held by a sole holder, to the registered address of the
holder of the share;

 



 

(b) if two or more persons are the holders, to the registered address of the
person who is first named in the Register;

 



 

(c) if a person is entitled by transmission to the share, as if it were a
notice to be sent under Article 249; or

 



 

(d) in any case, to such person and to such address as the person entitled to
payment may direct by notice to the Company.

 



 

235. Payment of a cheque or warrant by the bank on which it was drawn or the transfer of funds by the bank instructed to make the transfer shall be a good discharge to the Company. Every cheque or warrant sent or transfer of funds made by the relevant bank or system in accordance with these Articles shall be at the risk of the holder or person entitled. The Company shall have no responsibility for any sums lost or delayed in the course of payment by any method used by the Company in accordance with Article 232.

 



 

236. No dividend or other monies payable in respect of a share shall bear interest against the Company unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to the share.

 



 

237. Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date when it became due for payment shall, if the board so resolves, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment of any unclaimed dividend or other monies payable in respect of a share may (but need not) be paid by the Company into an account separate from the Companys own account. Such payment shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect of it. The Company shall be entitled to cease sending dividend warrants and cheques by post or otherwise to a member if those instruments have been returned undelivered, or left uncashed by that member, on at least two consecutive occasions, or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the members new address. The entitlement conferred on the Company by this Article 237 in respect of any member shall cease if the member claims a dividend or cashes a dividend warrant or cheque.

 



 

 ** _CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS AND RESERVES_**

 



 

238. The board may with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company:

 



 

(a) subject to the provisions of this Article 238, resolve to capitalise any
undistributed profits of the Company not required for paying any preferential
dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum
standing to the credit of any reserve or other fund, including without
limitation the Companys share premium account and capital redemption reserve,
if any;

 



 

(b) appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members or any class
of members on the record date specified in the relevant resolution who would
have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend and in the
same proportions;

 



 

(c) apply that sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts,
if any, for the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or
in paying up in full shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company of
a nominal amount equal to that sum but the share premium account, the capital
redemption reserve, and any profits which are not available for distribution
may, for the purposes of this Article

 



      
 

 



 

238, only be applied in paying up shares to be allotted to members credited as
fully paid;

 



 

(d) allot the shares, debentures or other obligations credited as fully paid
to those members, or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in
one way and partly in the other;

 



 

(e) where shares or debentures become, or would otherwise become,
distributable under this Article 238 in fractions, make such provision as they
think fit for any fractional entitlements including without limitation
authorising their sale and transfer to any person, resolving that the
distribution be made as nearly as practicable in the correct proportion but
not exactly so, ignoring fractions altogether or resolving that cash payments
be made to any members in order to adjust the rights of all parties;

 



 

(f) authorise any person to enter into an agreement with the Company on behalf
of all the members concerned providing for either:

 



 

(i) the allotment to the members respectively, credited as fully paid, of any
shares, debentures or other obligations to which they are entitled on the
capitalisation; or

 



 

(ii) the payment up by the Company on behalf of the members of the amounts, or
any part of the amounts, remaining unpaid on their existing shares by the
application of their respective proportions of the sum resolved to be
capitalised, and any agreement made under that authority shall be binding on
all such members; and

 



 

(g) generally do all acts and things required to give effect to the ordinary
resolution.

 



 

239. The board may, before recommending any dividend (whether preferential or otherwise), set aside out of the profits of the Company such sum as it deems fit as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the board, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied, and pending such application may, also at such discretion, either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as the board may deem fit, and so that it shall not be necessary to keep any investments constituting the reserve or reserves separate or distinct from any other investments of the Company. The board may also, without placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which it may deem prudent not to distribute.

 



 

 ** _RECORD DATES_**

 



 

240. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, and subject to the Act, the Company or the board may:

 



 

(a) fix any date as the record date for any dividend, distribution, allotment
or issue, which may be on or at any time before or after any date on which the
dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or made;

 



 

(b) for the purpose of determining which persons are entitled to attend and
vote at a general meeting of the Company, or a separate general meeting of the
holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, and how many
votes such persons may cast, specify in the notice of meeting a time by which
a person must be entered on the Register in order to have the right to attend
or vote at the meeting, and any changes to the Register after the time
specified by virtue of this Article 240 shall be disregarded in determining
the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting; and

 



 

(c) for the purpose of sending notices of general meetings of the Company, or
separate general meetings of the holders of any class of shares in the capital
of the Company, under these Articles, determine that persons entitled to
receive such notices are those

 



      
 

 



 

persons entered on the Register at the close of business on a day determined
by the Company or the board, which day may not be more than 21 days before the
day that notices of the meeting are sent.

 



 

 ** _ACCOUNTS_**

 



 

241. No member shall (as such) have any right to inspect any accounting records or other book or document of the Company except as conferred by statute or authorised by the board or by ordinary resolution of the Company or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

242. Subject to the Statutes, a copy of the Companys annual accounts and reports for that financial year shall, at least 21 clear days before the date of the meeting at which copies of those documents are to be laid in accordance with the provisions of the Statutes, be sent (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include where given in electronic form or by website communication) to every member and to every holder of the Companys debentures, and to every person who is entitled to receive notice of meetings from the Company under the provisions of the Statutes or of these Articles or, in the case of joint holders of any share or debenture, to one of the joint holders. A copy need not be sent to a person for whom the Company does not have a current address.

 



 

243. Subject to the Statutes, the requirements of Article 242 shall be deemed satisfied in relation to any person by sending to the person, instead of such copies, a summary financial statement derived from the Companys annual accounts and the directors report, which shall be in the form and contain the information prescribed by the Statutes and any regulations made under the Statutes.

 



 

 ** _COMMUNICATIONS_**

 



 

244. Any notice to be sent to or by any person pursuant to these Articles shall be in writing (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include where given in electronic form or by website communication).

 



 

245. Subject to Article 244 and unless otherwise provided by these Articles, the Company shall send or supply any Shareholder Information that is required or authorised to be sent or supplied to a member or any other person by the Company by a provision of the Statutes or pursuant to these Articles or to any other rules or regulations to which the Company may be subject in such form and by such means as it may in its absolute discretion determine provided that the provisions of the Act which apply to sending or supplying a document or information required or authorised to be sent or supplied by the Statutes shall, the necessary changes having been made, also apply to sending or supplying any document or information required or authorised to be sent by these Articles or any other rules or regulations to which the Company may be subject.

 



 

246. Subject to Article 245 and unless otherwise provided by these Articles, a member or a person entitled by transmission to a share shall send any notices, documentation or information which such person wishes or is required to communicate to the Company pursuant to these Articles to the Company in such form and by such means as it may in its absolute discretion determine provided that:

 



 

(a) the determined form and means are permitted by the Statutes for the
purpose of sending or supplying a document or information of that type to a
company pursuant to a provision of the Statutes; and

 



 

(b) unless the board otherwise permits, any applicable condition or limitation
specified in the Statutes, including without limitation as to the address to
which the document or information may be sent, is satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

Unless otherwise provided by these Articles or required by the board, any such
notices, documentation or information shall be authenticated in the manner
specified by the Statutes for authentication of a document or information sent
in the relevant form.

 



 

247. In the case of joint holders of a share, any Shareholder Information shall be sent to the joint holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of the joint holding and any Shareholder Information so sent shall be deemed for all purposes to have been sent to all the joint holders.

 



 

248. A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the Company or of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company shall be deemed to have been sent notice of the meeting and, where requisite, of the purposes for which it was called.

 



 

249. Shareholder Information may be sent or supplied by the Company to the person or persons entitled by transmission to a share by sending it in any manner the Company may choose authorised by these Articles for the sending of a document or information to a member, addressed to them by name, or by the title of representative of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt or by any similar description at the address (if any) as may be supplied for that purpose by or on behalf of the person or persons claiming to be so entitled. Until such an address has been supplied, Shareholder Information may be sent in any manner in which it might have been sent if the death or bankruptcy or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred.

 



 

250. Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall be bound by any notice in respect of that share which, before his name is entered in the Register, has been sent to a person from whom he derives his title.

 



 

251. Proof that Shareholder Information was properly addressed, prepaid and posted shall be conclusive evidence that the document or information was sent or supplied. Shareholder Information sent by the Company to a member by post shall be deemed to have been received:

 



 

(a) if sent by first class post or special delivery post from an address in
the United Kingdom to another address in the United Kingdom, or by a postal
service similar to first class post or special delivery post from an address
in another country to another address in that other country, on the day
following that on which the document or information was posted; or

 



 

(b) in any other case, on the second day following that on which the document
or information was posted.

 



 

252. Shareholder Information sent by the Company to a member by hand shall be deemed to have been received by the member when it is handed to the member or left at his registered address.

 



 

253. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, any notice or other Shareholder Information (excluding a share certificate) will be validly supplied if sent by the Company to any member or person nominated by a member to receive Shareholder Information in electronic form if that person has agreed (generally or specifically) (or, if the member is a company and is deemed by the Statutes to have agreed) that the communication may be sent in that form and:

 



 

(a) the notice or other Shareholder Information is sent using electronic means
(as that term is used in Section 1168 of the Act) to such address (or to one
of the addresses if more than one) as may for the time being be notified by
the member to the Company (generally or specifically) for that purpose or, if
the intended recipient is a company, to such address as may be deemed by a
provision of the Statutes to have been so satisfied;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) the notice or other Shareholder Information is sent in electronic form;
and

 



 

(c) in each case that person has not revoked the agreement.

 



 

254. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, any notice or Shareholder Information (excluding a share certificate) will be validly supplied if it is made available by means of a website communication where that person has agreed, or is deemed by the Statutes to have agreed (generally or specifically) that the communication may be supplied to him in that manner and:

 



 

(a) that person has not revoked the agreement;

 



 

(b) that person is notified in a manner for the time being agreed for the
purpose between that person and the Company of (i) the publication of the
notice or other Shareholder Information on a website, (ii) the address of that
website, and (iii) the place on that website where the notice of other
Shareholder Information may be accessed and how it may be accessed; and

 



 

(c) the notice or other Shareholder Information continues to be published on
the website throughout the period specified in the Act, provided that if the
notice or other Shareholder Information is published on that website for a
part but not all of such period, the notice or other Shareholder Information
will be treated as published throughout that period if the failure to publish
the notice or other Shareholder Information throughout that period is wholly
attributable to circumstances that it would not be reasonable to have expected
the Company to prevent or avoid.

 



 

255. Proof that a document or information sent or supplied by electronic means was properly addressed shall be conclusive evidence that the document or information was sent or supplied. A document or information sent or supplied by the Company to a member in electronic form shall be deemed to have been received by the member on the day following that on which the document or information was sent to the member. Such a document or information shall be deemed received by the member on that day notwithstanding that the Company becomes aware that the member has failed to receive the relevant document or information for any reason and notwithstanding that the Company subsequently sends a hard copy of such document or information by post to the member.

 



 

256. A document or information sent or supplied by the Company to a member by means of a website shall be deemed to have been received by the member:

 



 

(a) when the document or information was first made available on the website;
or

 



 

(b) if later, when the member is deemed by Article 253, 254 or 255 to have
received notice of the fact that the document or information was available on
the website. Such a document or information shall be deemed received by the
member on that day notwithstanding that the Company becomes aware that the
member has failed to receive the relevant document or information for any
reason and notwithstanding that the Company subsequently sends a hard copy of
such document or information by post to the member.

 



 

257. Where in accordance with these Articles a member is entitled or required to give or send to the Company a notice in writing, the Company may, if it in its absolute discretion so decides (and shall, if it is registered to do so or is deemed to have so agreed by any provision of the Statutes), permit such notices to be sent to the Company by such means of electronic communication as may from time to time be specified (or be deemed by the Statutes to be agreed) by the Company, so as to be received at such address as may for the time being be specified (or deemed by the Statutes to be specified) by the Company (generally or specifically) for the purpose. Any means of so giving or sending such notices by electronic communications shall be subject to any terms, limitations, conditions or restrictions that the board may from time to time prescribe.

 



      
 

 



 

258. A member shall not be entitled to receive any document or information that is required or authorised to be sent or supplied to him by the Company by a provision of the Statutes or pursuant to these Articles or to any other rules or regulations to which the Company may be subject if documents or information sent or supplied to that member by post in accordance with the Articles have been returned undelivered to the Company:

 



 

(a) on at least two consecutive occasions; or

 



 

(b) on one occasion and reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the
members address.

 



 

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any notice of a general
meeting of the Company which is in fact sent or purports to be sent to such
member shall be ignored for the purpose of determining the validity of the
proceedings at such general meeting.

 



 

A member to whom this Article 258 applies shall become entitled to receive
such documents or information when he has given the Company an address to
which they may be sent or supplied.

 



 

 ** _DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS_**

 



 

259. The Company shall be entitled to destroy:

 



 

(a) all instruments of transfer of shares in the Company which have been
registered, and all other documents on the basis of which any entry is made in
the Register, at any time after the expiration of six years from the date of
registration;

 



 

(b) all dividend mandates, variations or cancellations of dividend mandates,
and notifications of change of address at any time after the expiration of one
year from the date of recording;

 



 

(c) all share certificates which have been cancelled at any time after the
expiration of one year from the date of the cancellation;

 



 

(d) all paid dividend warrants and cheques at any time after the expiration of
one year from the date of actual payment;

 



 

(e) all proxy appointments which have been used for the purpose of a poll at
any time after the expiration of one year from the date of use; and

 



 

(f) all proxy appointments which have not been used for the purpose of a poll
at any time after one month from the end of the meeting to which the proxy
appointment relates and at which no poll was demanded.

 



 

260. It shall conclusively be presumed in favour of the Company that:

 



 

(a) every entry in the Register purporting to have been made on the basis of
an instrument of transfer or other document destroyed in accordance with
Article 259 was duly and properly made;

 



 

(b) every instrument of transfer destroyed in accordance with Article 259 was
a valid and effective instrument duly and properly registered;

 



 

(c) every share certificate destroyed in accordance with Article 259 was a
valid and effective certificate duly and properly cancelled; and

 



 

(d) every other document destroyed in accordance with Article 259 was a valid
and effective document in accordance with its recorded particulars in the
books or records of the Company,

 



 

but

 



      
 

 



 

(e) the provisions of this Article 260 and Article 259 apply only to the
destruction of a document in good faith and without notice of any claim
(regardless of the parties) to which the document might be relevant;

 



 

(f) nothing in this Article 260 or Article 259 shall be construed as imposing
on the Company any liability in respect of the destruction of any document
earlier than the time specified in Article 259 or in any other circumstances
which would not attach to the Company in the absence of this Article 260 or
Article 259; and

 



 

(g) any reference in this Article 260 or Article 259 to the destruction of any
document includes a reference to its disposal in any manner.

 



 

 ** _UNTRACED MEMBERS_**

 



 

261. The Company shall be entitled to sell, at the best price reasonably obtainable, the shares of a member or the shares to which a person is entitled by transmission if:

 



 

(a) during the period of 12 years before the date of the publication of the
advertisements referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article 261 (or, if
published on different dates, the first date) (the **_relevant period_** ) at
least three dividends in respect of the shares in question have been declared
and all dividend warrants and cheques which have been sent in the manner
authorised by these Articles in respect of the shares in question have
remained uncashed;

 



 

(b) the Company shall as soon as practicable after expiry of the relevant
period have inserted advertisements both in a national daily newspaper and in
a newspaper circulating in the area of the last known address of such member
or other person giving notice of its intention to sell the shares; and

 



 

(c) during the relevant period and the period of three months following the
publication of the advertisements referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article
261 (or, if published on different dates, the first date) the Company has
received no indication either of the whereabouts or of the existence of such
member or person.

 



 

262. To give effect to any sale pursuant to Article 261, the board may (a) if the shares are in certificated form, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer, or (b) where the shares are held in uncertificated form, in accordance with the Regulations, do all acts and things it considers necessary and expedient to effect the transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer (including issuing a written notification to the Operator requiring the conversion of the shares into certificated form).

 



 

263. An instrument of transfer executed by that person in accordance with Article 262 shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the holder of, or person entitled by transmission to, the shares. An exercise by the Company of its powers in accordance with Article 262(b) shall be as effective as if exercised by the registered holder of or person entitled by transmission to the shares. The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, and his title to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in, or invalidity of, the proceedings in reference to the sale.

 



 

264. The net proceeds of sale shall belong to the Company which shall be obliged to account to the former member or other person previously entitled for an amount equal to the proceeds. The Company shall enter the name of such former member or other person in the books of the Company as a creditor for that amount. In relation to the debt, no trust is created and no interest is payable. The Company shall not be required to account for any money earned on the net proceeds of sale, which may be used in the Companys business or invested in such a way as the board from time to time thinks fit.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _WINDING UP_**

 



 

265. If the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the Company and any other sanction required by the Insolvency Act 1986:

 



 

(a) divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of
the Company and may, for that purpose, value any assets and determine how the
division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of
members;

 



 

(b) vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees for the benefit of
the members; and

 



 

(c) determine the scope and terms of those trusts,

 



 

but no member shall be compelled to accept any asset on which there is a
liability.

 



 

266. The power of sale of a liquidator shall include a power to sell wholly or partially shares or debentures or other obligations of another body corporate, either then already constituted, or about to be constituted, for the purpose of carrying out the sale.

 



 

 ** _INDEMNITY_**

 



 

267. Subject to the Act but without prejudice to any indemnity to which he may otherwise be entitled, the Company shall indemnify, out of the assets of the Company, any director of the Company or of any associated company against all losses, liabilities and expenditures which he may sustain or incur in the execution and discharge of the duties of his office or otherwise in relation thereto, provided that this Article 267 shall only have effect insofar as its provisions are not void under sections 232 or 234 of the Act.

 



 

268. The Company may also indemnify, out of the assets of the Company, any director of either the Company or any associated company where the Company or such associated company acts as trustee of a pension scheme, against liability incurred by him in connection with the relevant companys activities as trustee of such scheme, provided that this Article 268 shall only have effect insofar as its provisions are not void under sections 232 or 234 of the Act.

 



 

269.

(each of (i) and (ii) a **_Limit_** ).

 



 

275. Where any person breaches any Limit, except as a result of a Permitted Acquisition, or becomes interested in any shares as a result of a Prohibited Acquisition, that person is in breach of these Articles.

 



 

276. The board may do all or any of the following as it in its absolute discretion sees fit where it has reason to believe that any Limit is or may be breached, except as a result of a Permitted Acquisition (and, in the case of a breach of a Limit which is capable of becoming a Permitted Acquisition in accordance with Article 280(c), at any time that such acquisition has not become a Permitted Acquisition), or any Prohibited Acquisition has been or may be effected:

(h) determine that some or all of the Excess Shares will not carry any right

The notice may also state that the member may not change any Excess Shares held in certificated form to uncertificated form. If the member does not comply with the notice, the board may require the Operator to convert Excess Shares held in uncertificated form into certificated form in the name and on behalf of the relevant member in accordance with the Regulations.

 



       
 

 



 

278. Where any Excess Shares are held by any Depositary in its capacity as a Depositary, the provisions of Articles 274 through 295 shall be treated as applying only to such Excess Shares held by any such Depositary and not to any other shares held by the relevant Depositary.

 



 

279. No Depositary shall be in breach of Article 274 or Article 275 or be an affected member for the purposes of Article 276 solely as a result of holding any shares (or interests in shares) in its capacity as a Depositary, provided that any shares held by any such Depositary may still be Excess Shares. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, all interests in shares held by or on behalf of persons other than a Depositary with respect to shares held by such Depositary shall be taken into account for all purposes of Articles 274 through 295.

 



 

280. An acquisition is a **_Permitted Acquisition_** (or, in the case of Article 280(c), an acquisition will become a Permitted Acquisition upon completion of the making and implementation of a Mandatory Offer in accordance with, and compliance with the other provisions of, Article 280(c)) if:

 



 

(a) the board consents to the acquisition or the acquisition is pursuant to an
offer made by or on behalf of an acquirer that is recommended by the board; or

 



 

(b) the acquisition is made as a result of a voluntary offer made and
implemented, save to the extent that the board determines otherwise:

 



 

(i) for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (except not
necessarily for those already held by the acquirer);

 



 

(ii) in cash (or accompanied by a cash alternative);

 



 

(iii) at a price not less than the highest price at which the acquirer (or any
person acting in concert with it) has acquired or been issued shares in the 12
month period prior to such offer being made;

 



 

(iv) with the offer being open for acceptances for at least 14 days after such
offer becomes or is declared unconditional as to acceptances;

 



 

(v) a condition of the offer must be that the offer will not become or be
declared unconditional as to acceptances unless the acquirer has acquired or
agreed to acquire (either pursuant to the offer or otherwise) shares carrying
over 75 per cent. of the voting rights of the Company; and

 



 

(vi) the offer shall be otherwise made and implemented by the acquirer in
accordance with the provisions of the City Code (as if the City Code applied
to the Company); or

 



 

(c) the acquisition is made pursuant to a single transaction which causes a
breach of a Limit (otherwise than as a result of a Permitted Acquisition) and
provided that:

 



 

(i) no further acquisitions are made by the acquirer (or any persons
determined by the board to be acting in concert with him) other than: (A)
pursuant to a Mandatory Offer made in accordance with Article 280(c)(ii) or
(B) that are Permitted Acquisitions under Article 280(a) or (d), provided that
no such further acquisition (other than pursuant to a Mandatory Offer made in
accordance with Article 280(c)(ii)) shall be or become, in any event, a
Permitted Acquisition under this Article 280(c); and

 



 

(ii) the acquirer makes, within seven days of such further acquisition, and
does not subsequently withdraw, an offer which, except to the extent the board
determines otherwise, is made and implemented in accordance with Rule 9 and
the other relevant provisions of the City Code (as if it so applied to the
Company) (a **_Mandatory Offer_** ), and is conditional on, but only on, the
acquirer receiving acceptances as set out in Article 280(b)(v), and (for the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt) acquisitions pursuant to a Mandatory Offer shall (subject
to compliance with the other provisions of this Article 280(c)) also be
Permitted Acquisitions; or

 



 

(d) the acquisition was approved previously by a special resolution passed by
a general meeting of members if no votes are cast in favour of the resolution
by:

 



 

(i) the person proposing to make the acquisition and any persons determined by
the board to be acting in concert with him; or

 



 

(ii) the persons (if any) from whom the acquirer (together with persons
determined by the board to be acting in concert with him) has agreed to
acquire shares or has otherwise obtained an irrevocable commitment in relation
to the acquisition of shares by the acquirer or any persons determined by the
board to be acting in concert with him; or

 



 

(e) a person breaches a Limit only as a result of the circumstances referred
to in Article 291.

 



 

281. Unless the board determines otherwise, in the case of a Permitted Acquisition pursuant to Article 280(a), 280(b) or 280(c) above, an offer must also be made in accordance with Rule 15 of the City Code (as if Rule 15 applied to the Company, but excluding Rule 15(b) which shall not apply to the Company).

 



 

282. No acquisition of any interest in shares which would give rise to a requirement for an offer pursuant to Article 280(c) may be made (and the board shall be entitled to refuse to register any transfer of shares effecting such acquisition) if the making or implementation of such offer would or might be dependent on the passing of a resolution at any meeting of shareholders of the acquirer or upon any other conditions, consents or arrangements without the permission of the board.

 



 

283. Unless (a) the acquisition is a Permitted Acquisition; or (b) the board determines otherwise, an acquisition of an interest in shares is a **_Prohibited Acquisition_** if Rules 4 ( _Restrictions on dealings_ ), 5 ( _Timing restrictions on acquisitions_ ), 6 ( _Acquisitions resulting in an obligation to offer a minimum level of consideration_ ), 8.1 ( _Disclosure by an Offeror_ ), 8.4 ( _Disclosure by Concert Parties_ ) or 11 ( _Nature of consideration to be offered_ ) of the City Code would in whole or part apply to the acquisition if the Company were subject to the City Code and the acquisition of such interest in shares were made (or, if not yet made, would, if and when made, be) in breach of or otherwise would not comply with Rules 4, 5, 6, 8.1, 8.4 or 11 of the City Code.

 



 

284. The board or such person appointed by the board has full authority to determine the application of Articles 274 through 295 inclusive including as to the deemed application of relevant parts of the City Code (as if it applied to the Company). Such authority shall include all discretion vested in the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (as if the City Code applied to the Company). Any resolution or determination of, or decision or exercise of any discretion or power by, the board or such person appointed by the board acting in good faith and on such grounds as the board or such person appointed by the board shall reasonably consider appropriate, irrespective of whether such grounds would be considered reasonable by any other party with or without the benefit of hindsight, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons concerned and shall not be open to challenge, whether as to its validity or otherwise on any ground whatsoever and, in the absence of fraud, the board or such person appointed by the board shall not owe any duty of care to or have any liability to any person in respect of any cost, loss or expense as a result of any such resolution, determination, decision or exercise of any discretion or power. The board or such person appointed by the board shall not be required to give any reasons for any decision, determination, resolution or declaration taken or made in accordance with Articles 274 through 295 inclusive.

 



      
 

 



 

285. The board may determine that at all times when the Company is in an offer period pursuant to Article 280(c) each member shall comply with the disclosure obligations set out in Rule 8 of the City Code as if the City Code applied to the Company.

 



 

286. If a person incurs an obligation to make an offer under Article 280(c), the board may waive the requirement to make such an offer if sufficient interests in shares are disposed of within a limited period (being such period as the board may determine in the particular case being not less than seven days) to persons unconnected with such person, so that the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which the person, together with persons acting in concert with him, is interested is reduced to below 30 per cent. in a manner satisfactory to the board.

 



 

287. A receiver, liquidator or administrator of a company, or any other insolvency or bankruptcy official, is not required to make an offer under Article 280(c) when he acquires an interest in shares carrying 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights in the Company in his capacity as such, but Article 280(c) shall for the avoidance of doubt apply to a purchaser from such a person.

 



 

288. If the board determines that a sale of shares (including Excess Shares) is required pursuant to Article 276(f) or 292, the board shall give such notices and make such requests for evidence of the disposal of any such shares as it may require, and the board may refuse the transfer of any such shares until the disposal required by Article 276(f) or 292 has been made to the satisfaction of the directors. In the event that any notice or request under this Article 288 has not been complied with to the satisfaction of the board and has not ceased to apply, the Company shall, so far as it is able, make a disposal of such shares, as the agent for the registered holder thereof or the person entitled by transmission from such holder. Such disposal shall be made or sought to be made by the Company in such manner, at such time and on such terms as the board determines in its absolute discretion to be appropriate. For the purposes of effecting any disposal under this Article 288, any one or more of the directors may, and the board may authorise any officer or employee of the Company to, act as the attorney(s) of any member in relation to the execution of documents and other actions to be taken for the sale of shares (including Excess Shares) determined by the board under Articles 274 through 295 inclusive.

 



 

289. No nominee of an acquirer or persons acting in concert with it may be appointed as a director, nor may an acquirer or any persons acting in concert with it exercise the votes attaching to any shares until the relevant offer has been declared unconditional in all respects.

 



 

290. If a director is affiliated with any acquirer or persons acting in concert with it under Articles 274 through 295 inclusive, he shall forthwith vacate his office if his resignation is requested by notice tendered at a meeting of the board by a majority of the other directors who are not so affiliated. For the purposes of this Article 290, like notices signed by each such director shall be effective as a single notice signed by all such directors.

 



 

291. If as a consequence of the Company redeeming or purchasing its own shares, there is a resulting increase in the percentage of the voting rights attributable to any interest in shares held by a person or persons determined by the board to be acting in concert and such an increase would constitute a breach of any Limit, such an increase shall be deemed a Permitted Acquisition.

 



 

292. Where an acquisition has been made that breaches a Limit and is a Permitted Acquisition by virtue of Article 280(c), the board may determine that some or all of the shares in which the acquirer is interested by virtue of such Permitted Acquisition must be sold (in accordance with Article 288 or otherwise) in the event that the corresponding Mandatory Offer required to be made under Article 280(c) is not successfully completed.

 



      
 

 



 

293. If any provision under Articles 274 through 295 inclusive or any part of any such provision is held under any circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then:

 



 

(a) such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such circumstances
and in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so
as to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible extent;

 



 

(b) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof under
such circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any other circumstances
or in any other jurisdiction; and

 



 

(c) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision
or the validity or enforceability of any other provision of Articles 274
through 295 inclusive.

 



 

Each provision of Articles 274 through 295 inclusive is severable from every
other provision of such Articles, and each part of each provision of such
Articles is severable from every other part of such provision.

 



 

294. Where used in Article 106 and Articles 274 through 295 inclusive, the phrases **_offer, interest in shares, acting in concert_** and **_voting rights_** shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the City Code.

 



 

295. Articles 274 through 294 inclusive only apply whilst the City Code does not apply to the Company.

 



 

 ** _DISPUTE RESOLUTION_**

 



 

296. The courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a member in that members capacity as such, or as a purported derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in the Company or seeking relief on behalf of the Company, against the Company or the board or any of the directors or officers individually (or against any combination of the foregoing persons), arising out of or in connection with these Articles or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with these Articles.

 



 

297. In no situation shall any director or officer owe any duty of any nature whatsoever to any member (in that members capacity as such).

 



 

298. Damages alone may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of Article 296 or Article 297, so that, in the event of a breach or anticipated breach, the remedies of injunction and an order for specific performance would in appropriate circumstances each be available.

 



 

299. The governing law of the Articles is the substantive law of England and these Articles shall be interpreted in accordance with English law.

 



 

300. For the purposes of Articles 296 and 297:

 



 

(a) a **_dispute_** shall mean any dispute, controversy or claim;

 



 

(b) references to **_Company_** shall be read so as to include each and any of
the Companys subsidiary undertakings from time to time; and

 



 

(c) **_director_ and _officer_** shall be read so as to include each and any
director and officer of the Company from time to time in his capacity as such
or as an employee of the Company and shall include any former director or
officer of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

 **APPENDIX**

 



 

 **SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE TERMS**

 



 

 **RIGHTS TO PURCHASE**

 



 

 **ORDINARY SHARES OF**

 



 

 **[HOLDCO] PLC**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, so far as they apply to or affect
[HoldCo] PLC (the **_Company_** ), the board of directors of the Company (the
**_Board_** ) may exercise any power of the Company to establish a
shareholders rights plan (the **_Rights Plan_** ). The Rights Plan may be in
such form as the Board shall in its absolute discretion decide and may in
particular (but without restriction or limitation) include such terms as are
described in this Summary of Example Terms.

 



 

Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board would declare and issue one purchase
right (a **_Right_** ) for each outstanding ordinary share, nominal value $[*]
per share, of the Company (the **_Ordinary Shares_** ). Each Right would
entitle the registered holder, upon payment to the Company of the price per
Ordinary Share specified in the Rights Plan, to have delivered to such holder
one Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment.

 



 

Until the earlier to occur of: (i) ten (10) days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (a
**_group_** ) has acquired beneficial ownership of 15 per cent. or more of the
outstanding Ordinary Shares (such person or group, an **_Acquiring Person_** )
or (ii) ten (10) business days (or such later date as may be determined by the
Board) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make,
an offer by a person or group the consummation of which would result in the
beneficial ownership of 15 per cent. or more of the outstanding Ordinary
Shares being acquired by that person or group (the earlier of such dates being
the **_Distribution Date_** ), each Right would be associated with an
individual Ordinary Share and the Rights would be transferred with and only
with the Ordinary Shares.

 



 

After the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ( **
_Right Certificates_** ) would be mailed to (or credited to the account of)
holders of record of the Ordinary Shares as of the close of business on the
Distribution Date. Such separate Right Certificates would then evidence the
Rights, and the Rights would then be separately transferable.

 



 

The Rights would not be exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights
would expire on a date to be specified in the Rights Plan, unless the Rights
were earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

 



 

After the Distribution Date, each holder of a Right, other than Rights held by
or on behalf of any Acquiring Person (which would thereupon become void),
would thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right that
number of Ordinary Shares having a market value of two times the exercise
price for the Right.

 



 

In the event that, after a person or group were to become an Acquiring Person,
Control (as defined in Article 25) of the Company were to be acquired by any
other person or group, provisions would be made so that each holder of a Right
(other than Rights held by or on behalf of an Acquiring Person which would
have become void) would thereafter have the right to receive upon the exercise
of a Right that number of shares of any such other person or group (or parent
of any such other person or group) that at the time of such acquisition would
have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

 



      
 

 



 

At any time after any person or group were to become an Acquiring Person and
prior to the earlier of one of the events described in the previous paragraph
or the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50 per cent. or more of the
outstanding Ordinary Shares, the Board would have the authority to exchange or
cause to be exchanged the Rights (other than Rights held by or all behalf of
such Acquiring Person, which would have become void), in whole or in part, for
Ordinary Shares at an exchange ratio of one Ordinary Share per Right, subject
to the receipt of any consideration required by applicable law to be received
by the Company in respect of the same.

 



 

At any time before any person or group were to become an Acquiring Person, the
Board would have the authority to redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part,
at a price per Right to be specified in the Rights Plan (the **_Redemption
Price_** ).

 



 

Prior to the Distribution Date, the Board would have the authority, except
with respect to the Redemption Price, to amend the Rights Plan in any manner,
subject to applicable law and any restrictions set forth in the Articles.
After the Distribution Date, the Board would have the authority, except with
respect to the Redemption Price, to amend the Rights Plan in any manner that
would not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights (other than
Rights held by or on behalf of any Acquiring Person, which would have become
void).

 



 

Prior to the exercise of a Right, a Right would not entitle the holder thereof
to any rights as a member of the Company, including, without limitation, the
right to vote or to receive dividends in respect of such Right.

8. Any material consents or approvals required to be obtained from governmental authorities or contract counterparties in order to consummate the Project Financing shall have been obtained and in full force and effect.

such required additional funding. Cambridge will have no obligation to invest
additional capital in the Group for the Project.

 



 

The parties agree to cooperate in good faith so that the terms and conditions
of the Shareholders Agreement shall not conflict with the applicable terms

buyout).

pursuant to which Cambridge (or an affiliate of

       
 

 



 

Cambridge) will provide operation and maintenance services for the Project,
and on market terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Cambridge and
Oxford, including, without limitation, that the pricing for Cambridges

wholly owned subsidiary or in connection with a sale of Oxford or, in the case
of Cambridge, Holdco.

interest in [Natgasoline Land Holding LLC] (as defined in the Restructuring
Steps Plan)) for a purchase price equal to $632.5 million (the "Call Option
Purchase Price"); _provided_ , that the Call Option Purchase Price shall

or cash at Cambridges election; provided, that Holdco may only elect to
satisfy the Call Option Purchase Price in Holdco shares if doing so would not
cause Oxford or any of its affiliates to be subject to the short-swing profit
recapture provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. The number of Holdco shares to be issued shall be determined
using an exchange ratio based on the market value of such shares immediately
before the closing of the call transaction.

 



 

 **Exit Rights** After the Blackout Period, either party may transfer all or
part of such partys interest in Firewater One, subject to the restrictions
described below; provided that, in the event that a party desires to transfer
less than all of such partys interest in Firewater One, such party agrees to
give the other party reasonable advance notice of such proposed transfer.

 



 

 _Right of First Refusal_. Either party shall have the right to transfer its
shares to an unaffiliated third party for cash consideration, subject to a
customary right of first refusal in favor of the other party.

unaffiliated third party made pursuant to the foregoing process, subject to

 **Confidentiality** Customary confidentiality provisions, including provision
allowing for each party to share confidential information with potential third
party purchasers of Firewater One equity, subject to the applicable party
entering into a confidentiality agreement with such third party.

 



 

 **Information Rights** In addition to all Board materials, each party shall
receive monthly financials, audited annual financial statements, bank
compliance certificates, quarterly financial statements, an annual budget and
monthly reports of operations (including a comparison to the annual

      
 

 



 

budget) and any other reports received by either party from any Group Company,
or provided to lenders or potential financing sources.

 



 

Each party shall be granted reasonable access to the properties, books and
records and personnel of all Group Companies at reasonable hours, upon
reasonable advance notice and for reasonable purposes, including in order to
conduct periodic audits of various kinds.

 



 

 **Independent Activities** Each party and their respective affiliates may
engage in, or own an interest in, any other entity that conducts or competes
with, any business the same or similar to the business of the Group and
neither any Group Company nor the other party shall have any right to the
profits therefrom or other claims with respect thereto.

 



 

 **Fiduciary Duties** The parties acknowledge that each party shall be
entitled to act in its own self-interest and shall not have any fiduciary
duties to Firewater One, Natgasoline, the other party or any affiliate of the
other party.

 



 

The parties acknowledge that each director, when conducting his or her affairs
and in making decisions with respect to the Group Companies shall be entitled
to act in the self-interest of the party that nominated him and shall not have
any fiduciary duties to any Group Company, the other party or any affiliate of
the other party. The parties and the Group Companies also waive, and agree not
to commence, any action against a director in his capacity as such based on
the assertion that such director made a decision for the benefit of the party
that nominated him and not a Group Company, the other party or any affiliates
of the other party.

 



 

 **Non-Solicit** So long as Oxford and Cambridge each owns, directly or
indirectly interests in Firewater One and for 1 year thereafter, none of
Oxford, Cambridge or their respective controlled affiliates shall solicit or
hire any of a Group Companys employees (subject to customary exceptions)
without the agreement of Oxford and Cambridge.

 



 

 **Dispute Resolution** In the event of certain disputes (scope to be agreed),
there will be an escalation mechanism to allow top executives to attempt to
resolve the matter.

 



 

The failure of the parties to agree on any matter requiring supermajority
approval as provided above shall not constitute

      
 

 



 

grounds for any dispute or judicial recourse.

 



 

Courts in Delaware shall be the exclusive venue for settling any disputes
outside of this process.

 



 

 **Remedies** The parties shall be entitled to specific performance, in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.

 



 

Cambridge shall have the right to withhold and set-off against any payment due
under the Shareholders Agreement (including in exercising the Call Right) the
amount of any claim for indemnification any Cambridge Indemnified Party is
entitled to pursuant to a written agreement between Oxford and Cambridge or a
final judicial determination in accordance with Section 12.9 of the Agreement
(or other dispute resolution mechanism agreed to in writing by Oxford and
Cambridge).

 



 

 **Governing Law/Jurisdiction** This term sheet was originally drafted
assuming that Firewater One was a Delaware LLC and that the laws of the State
of Delaware applied. The parties understand modifications may be required to
give the parties equivalent rights and protections now that the investment
vehicle is a Luxembourg entity. It is the intent of the parties that to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law such rights and protections (or
their applicable equivalents) shall be preserved.

Ownership Limit has been exceeded, sell a sufficient number of Voting
Securities in a manner otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement such

 **3.3** **Board representation**

 



 

(a) For so long as the S Shareholders, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own
Voting Securities representing at least ten per cent. (10%) of the Voting
Securities outstanding at such time, Capricorn may, upon written notice to the
Company, designate two (2) individuals as Directors (each, a " **Shareholder
Designee** ") and the Company shall appoint such Shareholder Designees as
Directors and take all necessary actions to maintain their appointment
(subject to this Clause 3.3); provided, however, that such Shareholder
Designee shall satisfy the requirements set forth in Clause 3.3(b); provided,
further, that, at such time that the S Shareholders, in the aggregate, cease
to Beneficially Own Voting Securities representing ten per cent. (10%) of the
Voting Securities outstanding at such time but still, in the aggregate,
Beneficially Own Voting Securities representing at least the Ownership
Threshold, Capricorn shall use its best endeavours to promptly cause one (1)
of its Shareholder Designees, if any, then appointed to the Board to resign,
effective immediately, from the Board and from any committees or subcommittees
thereof to which the Shareholder Designee is then appointed or on which he or
she is then serving, and the right of Capricorn to appoint Shareholder
Designees shall be permanently reduced from two (2) to one (1); provided,
further,

 



       
 

 



 

that, at such time that the S Shareholders, in the aggregate, cease to
Beneficially Own Voting Securities representing at least the Ownership
Threshold, Capricorn shall use its best endeavours to promptly cause each
Shareholder Designee, if any, then appointed to the Board to resign, effective
immediately, from the Board and from any committees or subcommittees thereof
to which the Shareholder Designee is then appointed or on which he or she is
then serving, and the right of Capricorn to designate Shareholder Designees
shall permanently terminate. Capricorn hereby designates to serve on the Board
as an initial Shareholder Designee, effective at the Closing, each of Gregory
Heckman and Alan C. Heuberger, and the Company agrees, effective at the
Closing, to promptly appoint Gregory Heckman and Alan C. Heuberger as
Directors, and shall take all necessary actions to maintain their appointment
(subject to this Clause 3.3). If for whatever reason, Gregory Heckman and/or
Alan C. Heuberger are not able to assume their function as director upon
Closing, Capricorn will be entitled to designate a replacement who meets the
requirements of Clause 3.3(b). Upon the Closing, the Board shall consist of
ten (10) Directors.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from
and after the Effective Time, any Shareholder Designee designated by the
Shareholders pursuant to Clause 3.3(a) or 3.3(d):

 



 

(i) shall not be an Affiliate or Associate of any Shareholder;

 



 

(ii) except in the case of Gregory Heckman, shall qualify as an "independent
director" under applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and under applicable
NYSE rules and regulations, or the applicable rules and regulations of the
principal securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are then listed;

 



 

(iii) would not, at the time of such designation, be required to disclose any
information pursuant to Item 2(d) or (e) of Schedule 13D (as in effect at the
date of this Agreement) if such Shareholder Designee were the "person filing"
such Schedule 13D;

 



 

(iv) shall not, at the time of such designation, be prohibited or disqualified
from serving as a director of a public company pursuant to any applicable rule
or regulation of the SEC or NYSE or pursuant to applicable law, including the
Companies Act and the CDDA;

 



 

(v) shall not during the term of his or her service as a Director be a
director, officer, employee or Affiliate or Associate of a Competitor; and

 



 

(vi) shall, in the good faith judgment of the Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee of the Board (the " **Nominating Committee** "), satisfy
the requirements set forth in the Companys Organisational

 



      
 

 



 

Documents and Corporate Governance Guidelines (as in effect from time to
time), in each case as are applicable to all non-executive Directors
generally;

 



 

provided, however, that, for purposes of this Clause 3.3(b), the Company
agrees that Messrs. Heckman and Heuberger (A) satisfy, on the date of this
Agreement, the requirements set forth in sub-clauses (i)-(vi) of this Clause
3.3(b) (other than Gregory Heckman with respect to sub-clause (i) due to his
service on the Oxford board until he resigns therefrom); and (B) shall, after
the date of this Agreement, be deemed to satisfy the requirements set forth in
sub-clause (vi) of this Clause 3.3(b) for so long as Messrs. Heckman and
Heuberger meet the requirements set forth in sub-clauses (i)-(v) of this
Clause 3.3(b). Each Shareholder Designee shall, upon appointment, to the
Board, execute such agreements as are required to be executed by all non-
executive Directors generally, including agreements relating to
confidentiality and non-use of information, and shall otherwise abide by the
provisions of all codes and policies of the Company that are in effect from
time to time and applicable to all non-executive Directors generally.

 



 

(c) The Company shall obtain customary director indemnity insurance on
commercially reasonable terms, which insurance shall cover the Shareholder
Designees.

 



 

(d) The Shareholder has the exclusive right to fill vacancies created by
reason of death, removal or resignation of any of its Shareholder Designees
and the Company shall, subject to the Articles, use its best endeavours to
promptly take all necessary actions to cause any such vacancies to be filled
by replacement directors designated by the Shareholder that meet the
requirement of Clause 3.3(b).

 



 

 **3.4** **Attendance at meetings**

 



 

For so long as the S Shareholders, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own Voting
Securities representing at least the Ownership Threshold, the Shareholders
shall cause all Shareholder Shares then owned by the Shareholders to be
present, in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the shareholders of the
Company occurring.

 



 

 **3.5** **Voting**

 



 

(a) For so long as the S Shareholders, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own
Voting Securities representing at least the Ownership Threshold, at each
meeting of the shareholders of the Company (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) occurring, each S Shareholder shall vote (or abstain
from voting) all Shareholder Shares then owned by such S Shareholder on any
matter or proposal on which the shareholders are entitled to vote (including
the nomination, appointment and removal of directors, but excluding any
acquisition or merger that would reasonably be expected to result in dilution
of the percentage of the

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the S Shareholders (in
which event no S Shareholder shall have any obligation to vote its Shareholder
Shares in any manner hereunder)) in accordance with the recommendation of the
Board.

 



 

(b) For so long as Oxford Beneficially Owns the Oxford Shares, at each meeting
of the shareholders of the Company (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) occurring, Oxford shall vote (or abstain from voting)
all Oxford Shares then owned by Oxford on any matter or proposal on which the
shareholders are entitled to vote (including the appointment and removal of
directors), in the same proportion as the Voting Securities of the Company
(excluding the Oxford Shares) are voted at such shareholders meeting.

 



 

 **3.6** **Share ownership related information**

 



 

For so long as this Agreement is in effect, each Shareholder shall, upon
request in writing by the Company, provide to the Company as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, any
information related to such Shareholders ownership or holding of Shareholder
Shares, including any agreements or arrangements relating to such ownership or
holding.

may be effected except in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this
Clause 4 and with the requirements of the Securities Act and any other
applicable securities laws. Any attempted Transfer in violation of this

(i) in a single Transfer or series of related Transfers by any Shareholder,

Securities then outstanding to the extent that as a result of such Transfer or
Transfers the Person or Group would Beneficially Own Voting Securities
representing more than ten per cent. (10%) of the Voting Securities then
outstanding (calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of Voting
Securities outstanding, as contained in the then most recently-available
filing by the Company with the SEC), and such Shareholder shall, to the extent

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Clause 4, the
Shareholders may, at any time, Transfer all or any portions of the Shareholder
Shares:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) in accordance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act;

 



 

(ii) in an offering registered with the SEC under the Securities Act that is
not a Directed Offering;

 



 

(iii) in response to a tender or exchange offer commenced by a third party
(for the avoidance of doubt, not in violation of this Agreement but including
a tender or exchange offer effected by way of a scheme of arrangement pursuant
to the Companies Act or any equivalent or analogous transaction) or by the
Company, provided that with respect to an unsolicited tender or exchange offer
commenced by a third party, such Transfer shall be permitted only if (A) such
tender or exchange offer includes an irrevocable minimum tender condition of
no less than three quarters of the then-outstanding shares of Ordinary Shares
and (B) as of the expiration of such offer (x) no shareholder rights plan or
analogous "poison pill" of the Company is in effect or (y) the Board has
affirmatively publicly recommended to the Companys shareholders that such

such Permitted Transferee (if other than the Company) agrees in writing to
acquire and hold such Transferred Shareholder Shares subject to and in
accordance with, and otherwise to be bound by the terms of, this Agreement as
if such Permitted Transferee were a Shareholder hereunder (but the original
Shareholder shall not be released from liability for any breach hereof by such
Permitted Transferee); provided, further, that if, at any time after such
Transfer, such Permitted Transferee ceases to be an S Family Member or Family
Trust or direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary or Controlled Affiliate of
such Shareholder, as applicable, such Shareholder shall cause, prior to the
time the Permitted Transferee ceases to be an S Family Member or Family Trust
or direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary or Controlled Affiliate, as
applicable, of the Shareholder, all Shareholder Shares held by such Permitted
Transferee to be Transferred to a Person that is, at such time, a Permitted
Transferee and that, prior to such Transfer, agrees in writing to acquire and
hold such Transferred Shareholder Shares subject to and in accordance with
this Agreement as if such Permitted Transferee were a Shareholder hereunder;
and

 



 

(v) with respect to the S Shareholders only, (A) to a charitable institution
for philanthropic purposes, provided that, prior to any such Transfer, such
transferee agrees in writing to acquire and hold such Transferred Shareholder
Shares subject to and in accordance with, and otherwise to be bound by the
terms of, this Agreement as if such transferee were a

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholder hereunder, or (B) pursuant to the terms of any trust or will of
such S Shareholder or by the laws of intestate succession or (C) solely in
connection with the payment of the exercise price and/or the satisfaction of
any tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise of any options,

made with respect to any uncertificated Shareholder Shares):

 



 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS) OF A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, DATED AUGUST
6, 2015, BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE SHAREHOLDERS PARTY THERETO, A COPY OF
WHICH MAY BE INSPECTED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER OR OBTAINED FROM
THE ISSUER WITHOUT CHARGE."

 



 

In connection with any Transfer made pursuant to Clause 4, other than a
Transfer to a Permitted Transferee that becomes a party to this Agreement
pursuant to Clause 4.1(c)(iv) or a Transfer to a transferee that becomes a
party to this Agreement pursuant to Clause 4.1(c)(v)(A), or at the time that
Transfers of Shares by any Shareholder or Shareholders are no longer subject
to any restrictions under this Agreement pursuant to Clause 7 or otherwise,
the Company shall remove, or cause to be removed, the legend set forth above
from the certificate or certificates evidencing any Shares of any such
Shareholder.

 



 

 **5.** **Freedom to pursue opportunities**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that: (a) each Shareholder, its Affiliates and
the Shareholder Designees (collectively, the " **Shareholder Affiliated
Persons** ") has the right to, and shall have no duty (contractual or
otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly engage in the same or similar
business activities or lines of business as the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including those deemed to be competing with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and (b) in the event that a Shareholder Affiliated Person
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a
corporate opportunity for each of the Company and such Shareholder Affiliated
Person, shall have no duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or
present such corporate opportunity to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, and shall not be liable to the Company or its Affiliates
or shareholders for breach of any duty (contractual or otherwise) by reason of
the fact that such Shareholder Affiliated Person, directly or indirectly,
pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to
another Person, or does not present such

 



      
 

 



 

opportunity to the Company, provided that any Shareholder Designee who is
offered an investment or business opportunity solely in his or her capacity as
a Director shall be obligated to communicate such opportunity to the Company,
in which case none of the Shareholder Affiliated Persons shall be permitted to
pursue such opportunity unless the Board determines not to do so.

 



 

 **6.** **Indemnification and Reimbursement**

 



 

To the fullest extent permitted by law and the Articles, the Company shall
indemnify and reimburse each of the Shareholder Designees in the same manner
and to the same extent as any other director of the Company from time to time.

 



 

 **7.** **Termination**

 



 

This Agreement shall terminate with immediate effect upon the earlier of (a)
the date that is one (1) year after the first date on which the S
Shareholders, in the aggregate, shall cease to Beneficially Own Voting
Securities representing at least the Ownership Threshold; and (b) the date not
less than the date five (5) years after the date hereof that the Company
elects to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Shareholders; provided that Clause 3.5(b) shall remain in full force and
effect following such termination, and shall terminate upon the date that
Oxford ceases to Beneficially Own any Oxford Shares; and provided further that
this Clause 7 and Clauses 6, 8 and 9 shall remain in full force and effect
following such termination. At any time from and after the Effective Time,
Capricorn may terminate the provisions of Clause 3.3 by giving written notice
to the Company. If any Shareholder Designee is serving on the Board at the
time of any termination pursuant to this Clause 7, Capricorn shall use its
best endeavours to promptly cause each such Shareholder Designee to resign,
effective immediately, from the Board and from any committees or subcommittees
thereof to which the Shareholder Designee is then appointed or on which he or
she is then serving and any right of Capricorn to designate Shareholder
Designees under the Articles or this Agreement shall terminate immediately.

 **9.** **General**

 



 

 **9.1** **Whole agreement**

 



 

This Agreement contains the whole agreement between the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof at the date hereof to the exclusion of
any terms implied by law which may be excluded by contract and supersedes any
previous written or oral agreement between the parties in relation to the
matters dealt with herein.

 



 

 **9.2** **No inducement**

 



 

Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it has not been induced to
enter into this Agreement by any representation, warranty or undertaking not
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.3** **Remedies**

 



 

So far as permitted by law and except in the case of fraud, each party agrees
and acknowledges that its only right and remedy in relation to any
representation, warranty or undertaking made or given in this Agreement shall
be for breach of the terms of the this Agreement to the exclusion of all other
rights and remedies (including those in tort or arising under statute).

 



 

 **9.4** **Injunctive relief**

 



 

Each party hereto acknowledges that it would be impossible to determine the
amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of the provisions
of this Agreement and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened
breach, of any of such provisions would likely be inadequate and, accordingly,
agrees that the other parties shall, in addition to any other rights or
remedies which they may have, be entitled to such equitable and injunctive
relief as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
specific performance of, or restrain any party from violating, any of such
provisions. In

 



       
 

 



 

connection with any action or proceeding for injunctive relief, each party
hereto hereby waives the claim or defence that a remedy at law alone is
adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each
provision of this Agreement specifically enforced against it, without the
necessity of posting bond or other security against it, and consents to the
entry of injunctive relief against it enjoining or restraining any breach or
threatened breach of such provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.5** **Legal advice**

 



 

Each party to this Agreement confirms it has received independent legal advice
relating to all the matters provided for in this Agreement, including the
provisions of this Clause 9.5, and agrees, having considered the terms of this
Clause 9.5, and this Agreement as a whole, that the provisions of this Clause
9.5, are fair and reasonable.

 



 

 **9.6** **Survival of rights, duties and obligations**

 



 

Termination of this Agreement for any cause shall not release a party from any
liability which at the time of termination has already accrued to another
party or which thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior
to such termination.

 



 

 **9.7** **Conflict with the Articles**

 



 

To the extent permitted by law, in the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy
between the provisions of this Agreement and the Articles, it is intended that
the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and accordingly the
Shareholders shall exercise all voting and other rights and powers available
to them so as to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement and shall
further if necessary procure any required amendment to the Articles.

 



 

 **9.8** **Several and not joint liability of Shareholders**

 



 

Each party hereby agrees that the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Shareholders under this Agreement are being made severally,
and not jointly, by the Shareholders, and no Shareholder will be liable for
any breach, default, liability or other obligation of any of the other
Shareholders.

 



 

 **9.9** **No partnership**

 



 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership between
the parties nor constitute any party the agent of any other party for any
purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.10** **Shareholder actions**

 



 

Any determination, consent or approval of, or notice or request delivered by,
or any other action of, any S Shareholder shall be made by, and shall be valid
and binding upon, all S Shareholders, if made by one or more S Shareholders
Beneficially Owning a majority

 



      
 

 



 

of the aggregate amount of the Shareholder Shares Beneficially Owned by the S
Shareholders. The Company shall be entitled to demand from time to time and at
any time, from the S Shareholders, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of such majority approval before proceeding with the Companys
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.11** **Release etc.**

 



 

Any liability to any party under this Agreement may in whole or in part be
released, compounded or compromised or time or indulgence given by that party
in its absolute discretion as regards any party under such liability without
in any way prejudicing or affecting its rights against any other party under
the same or a like liability, whether joint and several or otherwise.

 



 

 **9.12** **Amendments and waiver**

 



 

No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver
hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly
executed by the Company, where enforcement of the amendment, modification,
discharge or waiver is sought against the Company; or (ii) each Shareholder,
where enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is
sought against the Shareholders. Any waiver shall constitute a waiver only
with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no
way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect
or at any other time. The waiver by the Company or the Shareholders of a
breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement or the
failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or privilege hereunder,
shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar
nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges
hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is
exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may
otherwise have at law or in equity.

 



 

 **9.13** **Assignment**

 



 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
contemplated by Clause 4.1(c)(iv), none of the parties may directly or
indirectly assign any of their rights or delegate any of their obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Any purported direct or indirect assignment in violation of this Clause 9.13
shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

 **9.14** **Further assurance**

 



 

At any time after the date of this Agreement the parties shall, and shall use
all reasonable endeavours to procure that any necessary third party shall, at
the cost of the relevant party execute such documents and do such acts and
things as that party may reasonably require

 



      
 

 



 

for the purpose of giving to that party the full benefit of all the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.15** **Invalidity**

 



 

If any provision in this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any enactment or rule of law, such
provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this
Agreement but the legality, validity and enforceability of the remainder of
this Agreement shall not be affected.

 



 

 **9.16** **Counterparts**

 



 

This Agreement may be entered into in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any party may
enter into this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

 



 

 **9.17** **Costs**

 



 

Each party shall bear all costs incurred by it in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and entry into this Agreement and the documents to be
entered into pursuant to it.

 



 

 **9.18** **Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999**

 



 

A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement,
provided, that any Shareholder Designee from time to time may enforce the
terms of Clauses 5, 6 and 7 as if they were a party to this Agreement and the
parties shall not amend Clauses 5, 6 and 7, where to do so would have an
adverse effect on the rights of any Shareholder Designee, without the consent
of all Shareholder Designees at the relevant time.

 



 

 **10.** **Governing law and submission to jurisdiction**

 



 

 **10.1** **Governing law**

 



 

This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with
it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or
claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law,
without regard to the conflict of laws thereof.

 



 

 **10.2** **Jurisdiction**

 



 

Each party to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and
Wales are to have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit, action
or proceedings and/or to settle any dispute which may arise out of or in
connection with this Agreement (respectively, " **Proceedings** " and "
**Dispute** ") and the documents to be entered into

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to it and accordingly any Proceedings or Dispute arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement shall be brought in such courts.

 



 

 **10.3** **Submission and waiver**

 



 

All the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of
England and Wales and waive any objection to Proceedings in any such court on
the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

 



 

 **10.4** **Agent for service of process**

 



 

Without prejudice to any other permitted mode of service, each party to this
Agreement agrees that service of any claim form, notice or other document
(whether for the purpose of Proceedings begun in the courts of England and
Wales or for any other purpose set out in this Agreement) shall be duly served
on it if delivered personally or sent by registered post in the case of:

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of [*], 201[*] (this " _Agreement_ "),
between [Darwin Holdings Limited, a private company limited by shares
incorporated under the law of England, which will re-register as a public
company limited by shares in accordance with the provisions of the Combination
Agreement (the " _Company_ "), and OCI N.V., a public company ( _naamloze
vennootschap_ ) incorporated under the law of the Netherlands (" _Oxford_ " or
the " _Shareholder_ ").

 



 

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

 



 

WHEREAS, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Cambridge_
"), the Company, Beagle Merger Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly-owned, direct or indirect, subsidiary of the Company ("
_MergerCo_ " and, together with Cambridge and the Company, the " _Cambridge
Parties_ "), and Oxford entered into a Combination Agreement, dated as of
August [*], 2015 (the " _Combination Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among
other things, (i) Oxford will convey to the Cambridge Parties, and the
Cambridge Parties will acquire from Oxford, certain equity ownership interests
in certain Persons owned, directly or indirectly, in their entirety by Oxford
in exchange for consideration consisting, in whole or in part, of Ordinary
Shares (as defined below) to be issued by the Company to Oxford and (ii)
MergerCo will merge with and into Cambridge, with Cambridge becoming a wholly-
owned, direct or indirect, subsidiary of the Company (the " _Transaction_ "),
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Combination Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of the Combination
Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction, the Company has agreed to
grant the Shareholder certain registration rights as set forth below.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **DEFINITIONS**

 



 

SECTION 1.1 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:

 



 

" _Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person that,
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person, provided that
neither the Shareholders nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
an Affiliate of the Company or vice versa.

 



 

" _Agreement_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the preamble to this
Agreement.

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

SECTION 3.1 _Demand Request_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Date and until the Registration Rights Termination
Date, at any time when no Required Shelf Registration Statement is available
for the resale of Registrable Shares (other than by reason of a suspension
pursuant to Section Section 3.5), the Shareholder may request in writing that
the Company effect a registration under the Securities Act of such part of the
Shareholders Registrable Shares as the Shareholder requests to transfer in a

subject to the minimum threshold requirement applicable to such registration
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (such request, a " _Demand Request_ "). Upon

(a " _Demand Registration Statement_ ") covering such Registrable Shares to be
sold in a Marketed Underwritten Offering or a Non-Underwritten Offering, at
the sole discretion of the Shareholder. Each Demand Request shall specify the
number of Registrable Shares requested to be registered and the intended plan
of distribution of such Registrable Shares. Any registration requested by the

or sale on a continuous or delayed basis, pursuant to this Section 3.1.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder shall be entitled to initiate no more than three (3)

number of Registrable Shares requested by the Shareholder to be included

 



      
 

 



 

therein in accordance with Section 3.2(a)) or the pricing date of an
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down. A request for registration made in accordance
with Section 3.1(a) shall not count for the purposes of the limitations in
this Section 3.1(b) if (A) the Shareholder determines in good faith to
withdraw such request due to marketing conditions or regulatory reasons and
give written notice of such determination to the Company prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement and prior to the execution of an
underwriting agreement or purchase agreement relating to such request;
_provided_ that the Shareholder reimburses the Company for all Registration
Expenses incurred in good faith by the Company in connection with such Demand
Registration prior to the Companys receipt of such notice, (B) the
Registration Statement relating to such Demand Request does not become
effective within ninety (90) calendar days after the date such Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC (other than by reason of the Shareholder
having refused to proceed or a misrepresentation or an omission by the
Shareholder), (C) prior to the sale of at least fifty percent (50%) of the
Registrable Shares included in the applicable registration relating to such
Demand Request, such registration is adversely affected by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental
agency or court for any reason and the Company fails to have such stop order,
injunction, or other order or requirement removed, withdrawn or resolved to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Shareholder within thirty (30) calendar
days after the date of such order or (D) the conditions to closing specified
in any underwriting agreement or purchase agreement entered into in connection
with the registration relating to such request are not satisfied as a result
of a default or breach thereunder by the Company that proximately and
primarily caused the failure of such conditions.

the offering shall be chosen by the Shareholder, subject to the prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the
Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) If, at any time following the Effective Date until the Registration Rights
Termination Date, the Company proposes or is required to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of securities
of the Company of the same class as the Registrable Shares (such securities "
_Similar Securities_ "), whether or not for sale for its own account, on a
form and in a manner that would permit registration of the Registrable Shares
(excluding a Registration Statement that is (i) solely in connection with a
Special Registration, a dividend reinvestment plan or a rights offering, (ii)
pursuant to a Demand Registration in accordance with Section 3.1 or a Shelf
Registration or (iii) a "universal" Shelf Registration Statement), the Company
shall give written notice as promptly as practicable, but not later than ten
(10) calendar days prior to the anticipated date of filing of such
Registration Statement, to the Shareholder of its intention to effect such
registration and shall include in such registration all Registrable Shares
with respect to which the Company has received a written request from the
Shareholder for inclusion therein within ten (10) calendar days after the date
of the Companys notice (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). In the event that
the Shareholder makes such written request, the Shareholder may withdraw its
Registrable Shares from such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice
to the Company and the managing underwriter, if any, at any time at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
relating to such Piggyback Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw
any

 



       
 

 



 

Piggyback Registration under this Section 3.2(a), whether or not the
Shareholder has elected to include Registrable Shares in such registration. No
Piggyback Registration shall count towards the number of Demand Registrations
to which the Shareholder is entitled under Section 3.1(b).

 



 

(b) If a Piggyback Registration under Section 3.2(a) is proposed to be
underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Shareholder as a part of the
written notice given pursuant to Section 3.2(a). In such event, the lead
underwriter to administer the offering shall be chosen by the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses (subject to and in
accordance with Section 3.7) in connection with any Piggyback Registration,
whether or not any registration or prospectus becomes effective or final or is
terminated or withdrawn by the Company.

 



 

(d) If the registration of Similar Securities giving rise to a right to
Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 is initiated by the
Company for its own account, the Shareholder may include all the Registrable
Shares it requests in such Piggyback Registration on the same terms and
conditions as such Similar Securities included therein; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the offering to which such Piggyback Registration relates involves a
firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter(s) of such
offering advises the Company and the Shareholder in writing that, in its good
faith opinion, the total number or dollar amount of Similar Securities
proposed to be sold in such offering and Registrable Shares requested by the
Shareholder to be included therein, in the aggregate, exceeds the largest
number or dollar amount of securities that can be sold in such offering
without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an
adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company shall include in
the applicable registration or prospectus only such number of securities that
in the good faith opinion of such underwriter(s) can be sold in such offering
without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an
adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities shall be
included in the following order of priority:

 



 

(i) _first_ , the securities that the Company proposes to sell;

 



 

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Shares requested to be included by the
Shareholder and any Similar Securities requested to be included by any other
Persons exercising their contractual rights to piggyback registration, pro
rata (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate number of securities so
requested to be included therein; and

 



 

(iii) _third_ , any securities requested to be included therein by any other
Persons (other than the Company and the Shareholder and other Persons with
piggyback registration rights), allocated among such Persons in such manner as
the Company may determine.

 



 

(e) If the registration of Similar Securities giving rise to a right to
Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 is initiated by the
Company on behalf of holders of Similar Securities to be sold in an
underwritten offering, the Shareholder may include

 



      
 

 



 

all Registrable Shares requested by the Shareholder to be included in such
registration in such offering on the same terms and conditions as any Similar
Securities included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the managing
underwriter(s) of such offering advises the Company and the Shareholder in
writing that, in its good faith opinion, the total number or dollar amount of
securities to be included therein exceeds the largest number or dollar amount
of securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting
the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per
share offering price), the Company shall include in the applicable
registration or prospectus only such number of securities that in the
reasonable opinion of such underwriter(s) can be sold without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price), which securities shall be so included in the
following order of priority:

 



 

(i) _first_ , the Similar Securities requested to be included therein by the
holders of such Similar Securities, allocated among such Persons in such
manner as the Company may determine;

 



 

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Shares requested to be included by the
Shareholder and any Similar Securities requested to be included by any other
Persons exercising their contractual rights to piggyback registration, pro
rata (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate number of securities so
requested to be included therein;

 



 

(iii) _third_ , Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities offered by the Company
for its own account; and

 



 

(iv) _fourth_ , Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities offered by any other
holders of Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities requested to be included
therein (other than the Company and the Shareholder and other Persons with
piggyback registration rights), allocated among such Persons in such manner as
the Company may determine.

 



 

SECTION 3.3 _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Date, if the Company is eligible to use a Form S-3 or
any comparable or successor form or forms for a short-form registration
statement (a " _Short-Form Registration Statement_"), the Shareholder may
make a written request (a " _Shelf Notice_ ") to the Company to file a Short-
Form Registration Statement as a Shelf Registration Statement, which Shelf
Notice shall specify the kind and the aggregate amount of Registrable Shares
of the Shareholder to be registered therein and the intended methods of
distribution thereof. Following the delivery of a Shelf Notice, the Company
shall file with the SEC promptly (and, in any event, within sixty (60) days
following delivery of such Shelf Notice, provided that the Company shall not
be required to make such filing until the first Business Day after the date on
which the Form 8-K amendment contemplated by Section 7.14 of the Combination
Agreement is filed with the SEC) such Shelf Registration Statement, which
shall be an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405
under the Securities Act) if the Company qualifies at such time to file such a
Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Required Shelf Registration Statement_ ")
relating to the offer and sale of all Registrable Shares requested for
inclusion therein by the Shareholder in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the Shareholder (to the
extent permitted in this Section 3.3). Any registration made by the Company
under this Section 3.3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as a " _Shelf
Registration_." The Shareholder shall not deliver a Shelf Notice, and the
Company shall not be required to effect a Shelf Registration, during the
ninety (90) calendar day period following the effective date of a Registration
Statement pursuant to any Demand Registration or any Piggyback Registration
(provided that the number of Registrable Shares included in such Piggyback
Registration was not less than fifty percent (50%) of the number of
Registrable Shares requested by the Shareholder to be included therein in
accordance with Section 3.2(a)) and shall not be required to effect more than
two (2) Shelf Registrations. Subject to Section 3.5, the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause any Required Shelf Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof, or to become automatically effective if
such Required Shelf Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration
statement, and, so long as the Company remains eligible to register the resale
of Registrable Shares on Form S-3, to keep such Required Shelf Registration
Statement effective under the Securities Act until the earliest of the one
hundred eightieth (180th) day following the initial effective date of such
Required Shelf Registration Statement, such time as all Registrable Shares
that could be sold thereunder have been sold or are no longer outstanding and
the Registration Rights Termination Date (such period of effectiveness, the "
_Shelf Period_ ").

 



 

(b) If at any time that a Required Shelf Registration Statement covering
Registrable Shares pursuant to this Section 3.3 is effective the Shareholder
delivers a notice to the Company stating that the Shareholder intends to
effect an offering (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ ") of all or a portion of its
Registrable Shares included by it on such Required Shelf Registration
Statement and stating the number of Registrable Shares to be included in such
Shelf Take-Down, then the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
amend or supplement such Required Shelf Registration Statement and take such
other action as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the sale of such
Registrable Shares pursuant to such Shelf Take-Down.

 



 

(c) If the Shareholder elects by written request to the Company, a Shelf Take-
Down shall be in the form of a Marketed Underwritten Offering (an "
_Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), provided that the aggregate value of the
Registrable Shares to be included in such Marketed Underwritten Offering must
be at least twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), and the Company shall
amend or supplement the applicable Required Shelf Registration Statement for
such purpose as soon as practicable. In connection with any such Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down, the lead underwriter to administer the offering shall be
chosen by the Shareholder, subject to the prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the Company. The number of
Underwritten Shelf Take-Downs the Shareholder may make pursuant to Shelf
Registrations is limited to two in any Shelf Period.

 



 

SECTION 3.4 _Termination of Registration Obligation_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the obligation of the Company to register Registrable
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ and maintain the effectiveness of any
Required Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Section 3.1 shall terminate on the first date on which the
Shareholder (i) holds Registrable Shares representing less than one percent
(1%) of the outstanding Voting Securities and (ii) is able to freely sell its
remaining Registrable Shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act without
regard to the volume, manner of sale or filing

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of such rule (the " _Registration Rights Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , the obligation of the Company to register Registrable
Shares pursuant to this Article III and maintain the effectiveness of any
Required Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Section 3.1 shall thereafter revive (the " _Revival_ ") on
the date on which the Shareholder receives Registrable Shares as a result of
the Companys exercise of its call option pursuant to the terms of the
Firewater One Shareholder Agreement if on such date the Shareholder either (i)
as a result of the receipt of such Registrable Shares, holds Registrable
Shares representing one percent (1%) or more of the outstanding Voting
Securities or (ii) holds Registrable Shares representing less than one percent
(1%) of the outstanding Voting Securities and is not then able to freely sell
its Registrable Shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act without regard
to the volume, manner of sale and filing requirements of such rule. The
Revival, if it occurs, shall be effective on the seventh business day
following the Companys receipt of notice from the Shareholder of the Revival,
which notice must include evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of
the Shareholders ownership of a number of Registrable Shares sufficient to
give rise to the Revival and, in the case of a Revival under clause (ii) of
the immediately-preceding sentence, of the basis for the Shareholders
inability to freely sell its Registrable Shares under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act unless it is the same basis that exists at the time this
Agreement becomes effective pursuant to Section 4.12. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Revival becomes effective pursuant
to this Section 3.4, the Shareholder shall be entitled to initiate one Demand
Registration and one Shelf Registration.

 



 

SECTION 3.5 _Suspension_. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement with respect to a Demand Registration or a
Shelf Registration would require the Company to make a public disclosure of
material non-public information, which disclosure the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with external legal counsel) would materially
impact the Company or would materially impede, delay or interfere with the
Companys ability to effect a reasonably imminent material proposed
acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction, then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice
of such determination to the Shareholder, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, such Registration
Statement or any Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus; _provided_ , _however_
, that, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Shareholder, the Company
shall not be permitted to do so for a period of time in excess of ninety (90)
days in the case of any single delay or suspension, and the number of days in
any 12-month period on which such a suspension is in effect shall not exceed
one hundred twenty (120) (except that such number of days shall not exceed
ninety (90) in the 12-month period commencing on the Closing Date (as defined
in the Combination Agreement)). In the event that the Company exercises its
rights under the preceding sentence, the Shareholder shall suspend, promptly
upon receipt of the notice referred to above, the use of any Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus relating to such Demand Registration or Shelf
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Shares.
In the event of such a suspension for which notice is given by the Company
after the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement, the period
specified in clause (A) in Section 3.6(b) (or, in the case of a Required Shelf
Registration Statement, the Shelf Period) shall be extended by the number of
days of such suspension. The Shareholder shall keep confidential the receipt
of any notice under this Section 3.5 and the contents thereof, except as
required pursuant to applicable law, and, during any period of such delay or
suspension, shall not offer or sell or otherwise transfer any Shareholder
Shares or otherwise engage in trading of securities of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to

 



      
 

 



 

the contrary, upon the commencement of any Scheduled Black-Out Period, the
Shareholder shall immediately suspend the use of any Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Shares until the termination of such Scheduled Black-Out Period.

 



 

SECTION 3.6 _Registration Procedures_. Subject to Section 3.5 and the
Companys right to withdraw or terminate an applicable Piggyback Registration
under Section 3.2(a), whenever the Shareholder shall have requested in
accordance with Section 3.1, Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, as applicable, that
any Registrable Shares be registered pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2 or
Section 3.3, as applicable, the Company shall:

 



 

(a) use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement with respect to such Registrable Shares within the time periods
therefor specified herein, reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder and each
underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Shares and
their respective counsel in connection with any required filings with FINRA
and, if such Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon
filing, use reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be
declared effective as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, before filing a Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including free writing
prospectuses under Rule 433 under the Securities Act, each, a " _Free Writing
Prospectus_ "), the Company shall furnish to the Shareholder and each of the
managing underwriter(s), if any, copies of the Registration Statement and all
other documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits thereto), including
upon the reasonable request of the Shareholder and to the extent reasonably
practicable, all documents that would be incorporated by reference or deemed
to be incorporated by reference therein (other than documents publicly
available on the SECs EDGAR system or any successor system), which
Registration Statement and documents proposed to be filed will be subject to
the reasonable review and comment of the Shareholder and its counsel (
_provided_ that any comments are given to the Company promptly upon receipt of
such documents and in no event later than three (3) calendar days after such
documents are deemed under Section 4.4 to have been given to the Shareholder),
at the Shareholders sole expense;

 



 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement, the Prospectus used in connection therewith (including
Free Writing Prospectuses) and Exchange Act reports as may be necessary to
keep such Registration Statement (other than a Required Shelf Registration
Statement, the effectiveness of which shall be maintained for the Shelf
Period) effective for a period of (A) not less than sixty (60) days, (B) if
such Registration Statement relates to an underwritten offering, such longer
period as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter(s), a Prospectus is
required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Shares
by an underwriter or dealer or (C) such shorter period as will terminate when
all of the Registrable Shares covered by such Registration Statement have been
disposed of in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement (but in any event not before
the expiration of any longer period required under the Securities Act);

 



 

(c) furnish to the Shareholder and the managing underwriter(s), if any, such
number of conformed copies, without charge, of such Registration Statement,
each

filed therewith and such other documents as such Persons may reasonably
request, including in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Shares in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement; and the Company, subject to
the penultimate paragraph of this Section 3.6, hereby consents to the use of
such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Shareholder
and the managing underwriter(s), if any, in connection with the offering and
sale of the Registrable Shares covered by such Prospectus and any such
amendment or supplement thereto;

 



 

(d) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Shares
under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the
Shareholder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things that
may be necessary or reasonably advisable to enable the Shareholder to

accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof set
forth in the applicable Registration Statement ( _provided_ that the Company
shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
subsection; (ii) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction wherein it is
not so subject; or (iii) take any action which would subject it to general
service of process in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so subject);

 



 

(e) use its reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Shares covered by such
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental agencies, authorities and self-regulatory bodies as may be
necessary or reasonably advisable in light of the business and operations of
the Company to enable the Shareholder or the managing underwriter(s), if any,
to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Shares in the United States
in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof set
forth in such Registration Statement;

 



 

(f) promptly notify the Shareholder and the managing underwriter(s), if any,
at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered
under the Securities Act of the occurrence of any event or existence of any
fact as a result of which the Prospectus (including any information
incorporated by reference therein) included in such Registration Statement, as
then in effect, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and, as promptly as practicable upon
discovery, prepare and furnish to the Shareholder a reasonable number of
copies of a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus, or file any other
required document, as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to any
prospective purchasers of such Registrable Shares, such Prospectus shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made;

 



 

(g) promptly notify the Shareholder and the managing underwriter(s) of any
underwritten offering, if any, (i) when the Registration Statement, any pre-
effective amendment, the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement or any Free Writing
Prospectus has been filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become

 



      
 

 



 

effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
such Registration Statement or to such Prospectus or for additional
information; (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; and (iv) of the suspension of the qualification
of such securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the
institution of any proceedings for any such purposes;

 



 

(h) enter into underwriting agreements with customary provisions as the
Selling Holders (if such registration is a Demand Registration or an
underwritten offering pursuant to a Shelf Registration) or the managing
underwriter(s), if any, reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Shares;

 



 

(i) make available for inspection by the Shareholder and the Shareholders
counsel, any managing underwriter(s) participating in any disposition pursuant
to such Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by the Shareholder or underwriter(s), all financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and documents relating to the business
of the Company, and cause the Companys officers, directors, employees and
independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by the
Shareholder or such underwriter(s), attorney, accountant or agent in
connection with such Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Shareholder shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such
underwriter(s), accountant or other agent to (i) enter into a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company; and
(ii) minimize the disruption to the Companys business in connection with the
foregoing;

 



 

(j) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least twelve (12) months beginning with the first
day of the Companys first full calendar quarter after the effective date of
the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

 



 

(k) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related Prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order as
soon as reasonably practicable;

 



 

(l) subject to Section 3.7, cause its senior management to use reasonable
efforts to support the marketing of the Registrable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement pursuant to any Demand Registration or by a Required
Shelf Registration Statement in connection with an underwritten offering

(m) if such Registrable Shares are being sold in an underwritten public
offering, use its reasonable efforts to (i) furnish, on the date the
underwriting agreement is signed and on the date such Registrable Shares are
delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration, a
comfort letter in customary form, addressed to each of the managing

 



      
 

 



 

underwriter(s), signed by the independent public accountants who have issued
an audit report on the Companys financial statements included in the
applicable Registration Statement and (ii) provide, on the date of the closing
under the underwriting agreement, a legal opinion of the Companys outside
counsel, addressed to each of the managing underwriter(s), in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by legal opinions of
such nature and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the
managing underwriter(s).

 



 

Subject to the limitations on the Companys ability to delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, a Registration
Statement or a Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Section 3.5,
the Shareholder shall, upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.6(f), promptly
discontinue its disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to any Registration
Statement until the Shareholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3.6(f). If so directed by the
Company, the Shareholder shall deliver to the Company (at the Companys
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, in the Shareholders
possession of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Shares at the time of
receipt of such notice. In the event that the Company shall give any such
notice, the period specified in clause (A) in Section 3.6(b) (or, in the case
of a Required Shelf Registration Statement, the Shelf Period), as applicable,
shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including
the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the
Shareholder shall have been given the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.6(f).

 



 

In the case of any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares registered
under a Required Shelf Registration Statement or a Demand Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 3.1(a), or in the case of a Piggyback
Registration under Section 3.2 or a Shelf Registration, (i) all Registrable
Shares or Similar Securities to be included in such offering or registration,
as the case may be, shall be subject to the applicable underwriting agreement
with customary terms (including customary provisions relating to indemnities
and contribution), and neither the Shareholder nor any holder of Similar
Securities may participate in such offering or registration unless such Person
agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided therein; and
(ii) neither the Shareholder nor any holder of Similar Securities may
participate in such offering or registration unless such Person completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up
agreements, underwriting agreements, custody agreements and other documents
reasonably required to be executed in connection therewith, and provides such
other information to the Company and the underwriter(s) as may be reasonably
requested to offer or register such Persons Registrable Shares or Similar
Securities, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Shareholder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties
other than those related to title and ownership of, and power and authority to
transfer, the Registrable Shares of the Shareholder included therein and the
Shareholders intended method of distribution of such Registrable Shares and
as to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in the applicable
Registration Statement, Prospectus or other document in reliance upon, and in
conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company or
the managing underwriter(s) by the Shareholder or its Representatives
pertaining to the Shareholder and (B) the aggregate amount of liability of the
Shareholder pursuant to any indemnification obligation thereunder shall not
exceed the net proceeds received by the Shareholder from such offering. As a
condition to including Registrable

 



      
 

 



 

Shares in any Registration Statement filed in accordance with this _Article
III_, the Company may require that it shall have received an undertaking
reasonably satisfactory to the Company from any underwriter to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its directors, officers and Affiliates to the
extent customarily provided by underwriters in connection with similar
securities and offerings.

 



 

After the Shareholder has been notified of its opportunity to include
Registrable Shares in any Piggyback Registration, the Shareholder (i) shall
treat the Offering Confidential Information as confidential information, (ii)
shall not use any Offering Confidential Information for any purpose other than
to evaluate whether to include its Registrable Shares in such Piggyback
Registration and (iii) shall not disclose any Offering Confidential
Information to any Person other than such of its Representatives as have a
need to know such Offering Confidential Information in connection with such
purpose, which Representatives the Shareholder shall cause to comply with the
requirements of this paragraph; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholder
may disclose Offering Confidential Information if such disclosure is required
by legal process, but the Shareholder shall cooperate with the Company to
limit the extent of such disclosure through protective order or otherwise, and
to seek confidential treatment of the Offering Confidential Information. The
Shareholder shall not offer or sell or otherwise transfer any Shareholder
Shares or otherwise engage in trading of securities of the Company while in
possession of Offering Confidential Information.

 



 

SECTION 3.7 _Registration Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all expenses incidental to
the Companys performance of or compliance with this _Article III_ (the "
_Registration Expenses_ "), including (i) all registration and filing fees
(including (A) with respect to filings required to be made with the SEC, all
applicable securities exchanges and/or FINRA and (B) compliance with
securities or blue sky laws including any fees and disbursements of counsel
for the underwriter(s) in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 3.6(d)); (ii) word processing,

for Registrable Shares in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository
Trust Company and of printing Prospectuses, if the printing of Prospectuses is
requested by the managing underwriter(s), if any, or by the Shareholder);
(iii) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses; (iv) fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Company; and (v) fees and disbursements of all independent
certified public accountants (including the fees and disbursements in
connection with any "cold comfort" letters required by this Agreement) and

The Company shall, in any event, pay its internal expenses, the expenses of
any annual audit or quarterly review of the Companys financial statements by
the Companys independent certified public accountants, the expenses of any
liability insurance of the Company and the expenses and fees for listing the
Registrable Shares to be registered on the applicable securities exchange. All
underwriting discounts, selling commissions and transfer taxes and fees and
disbursements of counsel and any other advisers or agents of the Shareholder
(collectively, " _Selling Expenses_ ") incurred in connection with the
offering of any Registrable Shares shall be borne by the Shareholder. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not bear any Selling Expenses in
connection with its obligations under this Agreement. All expenses incurred in
connection with

 



      
 

 



 

any "road shows" undertaken pursuant to Section 3.6(l) shall be borne in equal
proportion by the Shareholder and the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be
required to pay Registration Expenses for any Demand Registration begun
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) the request for which has been subsequently
withdrawn by the Shareholder unless the withdrawal is (i) requested under the
circumstances described in Section 3.5; or (ii) based upon (A) any fact,
circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence that individually or in the
aggregate with all other facts or circumstances, events, changes, effects or

and of which the Company had not otherwise notified, in writing, the
Shareholder at the time of such request.

 



 

SECTION 3.8 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 



 

(a) In the case of each offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this
_Article III_, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder and its directors and officers and
each Person, if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Shareholder from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, actions or
proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) in respect thereof and expenses
(including reasonable and documented fees of counsel) (collectively, "
_Claims_ ") to which each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar
as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement reached in accordance
with the requirements for consent as provided herein) arise out of or are
based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any preliminary or final
Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such
Registration Statement) contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, (ii) any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any
preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus
incorporated into such Registration Statement), in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (iii) any
violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state
securities law in connection with such offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be liable to any such indemnified party in any such case
to the extent that any such Claims arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement contained in or omission or alleged
omission from such Registration Statement, or preliminary or final Prospectus
(including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration
Statement), or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the
Shareholder or any Representative of the Shareholder expressly for use
therein; _provided_ , _further_ , that that the foregoing indemnity agreement,
with respect to any Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, shall not inure to
the benefit of any such indemnified party if the Person asserting any Claims
against such indemnified party purchased Shareholder Shares and (x) prior to
the time of sale of the Shareholder Shares to such Person (the " _Time of
Sale_ "), the Company shall have notified the Shareholder that the Prospectus
or Free Writing Prospectus (as it existed prior to the Time of Sale) contains
an untrue statement of material fact

 



       
 

 



 

or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (y) such untrue
statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
was provided to the Shareholder in advance of the Time of Sale, and (z) such
corrected preliminary Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus was not conveyed
to such Person at or prior to the Time of Sale. In connection with any
underwritten offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this _Article
III_, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter, the
officers and directors of such underwriter and each Person, if any, that
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) such underwriter to substantially the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Shareholder by the
Company.

 



 

(b) In the case of each offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this
_Article III_, the Shareholder shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and officers
and each Person, if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company from and
against any Claims to which each such indemnified party may become subject,
insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement reached in
accordance with the requirements for consent as provided herein) arise out of
or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any preliminary or
final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such
Registration Statement) contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or arise out of or
are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of any preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free
Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration Statement), in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each
case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Shareholder or any
Representative of the Shareholder expressly for use therein. The liability of
the Shareholder under the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.8(b) shall be
limited to an amount equal to the dollar amount of the net proceeds received
by such Selling Holder from Shareholder Shares sold by such Selling Holder
pursuant to such Registration Statement or Prospectus. In connection with any
underwritten offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this _Article
III_, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter, the
officers and directors of such underwriter and each Person, if any, that
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) such underwriter and any other selling securityholder in
such offering (and, in the case of each such other selling securityholder,
such selling securityholders officers and directors and each Person, if any,
that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such selling securityholder), to substantially
the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
Company by the Shareholder.

 



 

(c) If, for any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section
3.8(a) or Section 3.8(b) are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold
harmless an indemnified party in respect of any Claims referred to therein
other than by the terms of this Section 3.8, then each Indemnifying Party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such

 



      
 

 



 

indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to
statements or omissions that that resulted in such Claims. The relative fault
of such Indemnifying Party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or by
such indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
If, however, the allocation in the first sentence of this Section 3.8(c) is
not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults, but also the relative
benefits of the Indemnifying Party and the indemnified party, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section
3.8(c) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations
referred to in the preceding sentences of this Section 3.8(c). The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above
shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3.9) any reasonable and documented legal or other fees or out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder shall not be liable to contribute any amount in
excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by the Shareholder
from Shareholder Shares sold by the Shareholder pursuant to such Registration
Statement or Prospectus.

 



 

SECTION 3.9 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under Section 3.8 in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Claim against the indemnified party, such indemnified party
shall notify the Company or the Shareholder, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of such Claim, the amount or the estimated
amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim), any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and,
to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") promptly after receipt by such indemnified party of written
notice of the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide a Claim
Notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations provided hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the indemnified partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the indemnified party relating to the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to provide any such copies shall not affect the indemnification
obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



 

(b) If a Claim is made against an indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses,
to assume the

 



      
 

 



 

defense thereof with separate counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof,
unless the Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially
different defenses for the indemnified party and the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof and as
otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the indemnified party shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Claim, and the indemnified party shall use
reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of a Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. The Indemnifying Party may pay,
settle or compromise a Claim without the written consent of the indemnified
party, so long as such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) does not
subject the indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

 



 

SECTION 3.10 _Rule 144; Regulation S_. The Company will use its reasonable
efforts to timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by
the SEC thereunder, and to take such further action as the Shareholder may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the
Shareholder to sell Registrable Shares without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule
144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act or (ii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

 



 

SECTION 3.11 _Holdback_. The Company and the Shareholder agree, in connection
with any underwritten offering of equity securities of the Company, upon the
written request of the managing underwriter(s) of such offering, not to effect
(other than pursuant to such underwritten offering) any public sale or
distribution of Shareholder Shares or other equity securities of the Company,
including any sale or distribution pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, or make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the
purchase of, or otherwise transfer, any Registrable Shares or other equity
securities of the Company, in each case during the Holdback Period (and, if
(A) during the last seventeen (17) days of the Holdback Period, the Company
issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to
the Company occurs or (B) prior to the expiration of the Holdback Period, the
Company announces that it will release earnings results during the sixteen
(16) day period beginning on the last day of the Holdback Period, until the
expiration of the eighteen (18) day period beginning on

 



      
 

 



 

the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news
or the occurrence of the material event), without the prior written consent of
the managing underwriter(s).

 



 

SECTION 3.12 _Existing Registration Statements_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary and subject to applicable law and regulation, the Company may
satisfy any obligation hereunder to file or use reasonable efforts to file a
Registration Statement or to have a Registration Statement become effective by
designating, by notice to the Shareholder, a Registration Statement that
previously has been filed with the SEC or become effective, as the case may
be, as the relevant Registration Statement for purposes of satisfying such
obligation, and all references to any such obligation shall be construed
accordingly; _provided_ that such previously filed Registration Statement may
be amended or, subject to applicable securities laws, supplemented to add the
number of Registrable Shares, and, to the extent necessary, to identify
selling securityholders thereunder. To the extent this Agreement refers to the
filing or effectiveness of other Registration Statements by or at a specified
time and the Company has, in lieu of then filing such Registration Statements
or having such Registration Statements become effective, designated a
previously filed or effective Registration Statement as the relevant
Registration Statement for such purposes, in accordance with the preceding
sentence, such references shall be construed to refer to such designated
Registration Statement, as amended.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

SECTION 4.1 _Injunctive Relief_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it would
be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the other parties shall, in
addition to any other rights or remedies which they may have, be entitled to
such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or
defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement specifically
enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.2 _Assignments_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. None of the parties may directly or indirectly assign any
of their rights or delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported direct
or indirect assignment in violation of this Section 4.2 shall be null and void
ab initio.

 



 

SECTION 4.3 _Amendments; Waiver_. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set
forth in writing and duly executed by (i) the Company, where enforcement of
the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought against the
Company; or (ii) the Shareholder, where enforcement

 



      
 

 



 

of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought against the
Shareholder. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to
the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. The waiver by the Company or the Shareholder of a breach of or a default
under any of the provisions of this Agreement or the failure to exercise or
delay in exercising any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver
of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or
of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in
equity.

 



 

SECTION 4.4 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to
be given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given to a party when (i) delivered to the appropriate address by hand
or by nationally recognized overnight courier service; (ii) sent by facsimile
with confirmation of transmission by the transmitting equipment; or (iii) sent

severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

SECTION 3.1 _Demand Request_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Date and until the Registration Rights Termination
Date, at any time when no Required Shelf Registration Statement is available
for the resale of Registrable Shares (other than by reason of a suspension
pursuant to Section 3.5), one or more Shareholders may request in writing that
the Company effect a registration under the Securities Act of such part of
such Shareholders Registrable Shares as such Shareholders request to transfer
in a Marketed Underwritten Offering or a Non-Underwritten Offering in each
case subject to the minimum threshold requirement applicable to such
registration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (such request, a " _Demand Request_ ,"
and such Shareholders the " _Initiating Holders_ " with respect to such Demand
Request). Upon receipt of any Demand Request, the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to file, not later than the later of (x) the date that is sixty (60)
calendar days after receipt by the Company of such Demand Request and (y) the
first Business Day after the date on which the Form 8-K amendment contemplated
by Section 7.14 of the Combination Agreement is filed with the SEC, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, a

 



      
 

 



 

Registration Statement with the SEC (a " _Demand Registration Statement_ ")
covering such Registrable Shares to be sold in a Marketed Underwritten
Offering or a Non-Underwritten Offering, at the sole discretion of the
Initiating Holders (the number and amount of Registrable Shares required to be
registered on such Demand Registration Statement being subject to Section
3.1(b)). Each Demand Request shall specify the identity of each Initiating
Holder, the number of Registrable Shares of each Initiating Holder requested
to be registered, the aggregate number of Registrable Shares requested to be
registered by the Initiating Holders and the intended plan of distribution of
such Registrable Shares. Any registration requested by one or more
Shareholders under this Section 3.1(a) is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Demand Registration_." Unless otherwise agreed by the Company, any Demand
Registration to be made by way of a Marketed Underwritten Offering must relate
to a firm commitment underwriting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to file or make available
any Shelf Registration Statement, or otherwise register securities for offer
or sale on a continuous or delayed basis, pursuant to this Section 3.1.

 



 

(b) After receipt of a Demand Request, the Company shall give written notice
thereof to all Shareholders, other than the Initiating Holders, with respect
to such Demand Request, not later than ten (10) calendar days after such
receipt and shall include in the applicable Demand Registration Statement (i)
the Registrable Shares specified in such Demand Request and (ii) all
Registrable Shares with respect to which the Company has received a written
request for such inclusion from Shareholders, other than such Initiating
Holders, within seven (7) calendar days after the date of the Companys giving
such notice (such Shareholders providing such requests, together with such
Initiating Holders, being referred to herein as the " _Participating Holders_
" with respect to the applicable Demand Registration). The Company and holders
of Similar Securities may participate in and include any Similar Securities in
the Demand Registration relating to such Demand Request. If the managing
underwriter(s) of the offering to which a Demand Registration Statement
relates advise the Company and the Participating Holders in writing that, in
its good faith opinion, the total number or dollar amount of Registrable
Shares and Similar Securities proposed to be sold in such offering exceeds the
largest number or dollar amount of securities that can be sold in such
offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering
(including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company
shall include in the applicable Demand Registration Statement only such number
of securities that in the good faith opinion of such underwriter(s) can be
sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the
offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price),
allocated as follows: (i) first, the Registrable Shares requested to be
included by the Participating Holders, pro rata on the basis of the number of
Registrable Shares requested in accordance with the terms hereof to be
included in such Demand Registration Statement and (ii) second, any securities
requested to be included therein by any other Persons (including the Company),
allocated among such Persons in such manner as the Company may determine.

 



 

(c) The Shareholders shall be entitled to initiate no more than three (3)
Demand Registrations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect any Demand Registration (i) unless the aggregate value of
the Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the Shareholders in such
Demand Registration is at least twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000); and
(ii) during the ninety (90) calendar day period following the effective date
of a Registration Statement pursuant to any other Demand Registration or a
Piggyback Registration

 



       
 

 



 

( _provided_ that the number of Registrable Shares included in such Piggyback
Registration was not less than fifty percent (50%) of the number of
Registrable Shares requested by the Shareholders to be included therein in
accordance with Section 3.2(a)). A request for registration made in accordance
with Section 3.1(a) shall not count for the purposes of the limitations in
this Section 3.1(c) if (A) the Initiating Holders determine in good faith to
withdraw such request due to marketing conditions or regulatory reasons and
give written notice of such determination to the Company prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement and prior to the execution of an
underwriting agreement or purchase agreement relating to such request;
_provided_ that the Initiating Holders reimburse the Company for all
Registration Expenses incurred in good faith by the Company in connection with
such Demand Registration prior to the Companys receipt of such notice, (B)
the Registration Statement relating to such Demand Request does not become
effective within ninety (90) calendar days after the date such Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC (other than by reason of any Participating
Holder having refused to proceed or a misrepresentation or an omission by any
Participating Holder), (C) prior to the sale of at least fifty percent (50%)
of the Registrable Shares included in the applicable registration relating to
such Demand Request, such registration is adversely affected by any stop
order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other
governmental agency or court for any reason and the Company fails to have such
stop order, injunction, or other order or requirement removed, withdrawn or
resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Shareholder within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date of such order or (D) the conditions to closing
specified in any underwriting agreement or purchase agreement entered into in
connection with the registration relating to such request are not satisfied as
a result of a default or breach thereunder by the Company that proximately and
primarily caused the failure of such conditions.

 



 

(d) In connection with any Demand Request, the lead underwriter to administer
the offering shall be chosen by the Initiating Holders holding a majority of
the Registrable Shares included in such Demand Request, subject to the prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of
the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) If, at any time following the Effective Date until the Registration Rights
Termination Date, the Company proposes or is required to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of securities
of the Company of the same class as the Registrable Shares (such securities "
_Similar Securities_ "), whether or not for sale for its own account, on a
form and in a manner that would permit registration of the Registrable Shares
(excluding a Registration Statement that is (i) solely in connection with a
Special Registration, a dividend reinvestment plan or a rights offering, (ii)
a "universal" Shelf Registration Statement or (iii) pursuant to a Demand
Registration in accordance with Section 3.1 or a Shelf Registration), the
Company shall give written notice as promptly as practicable, but not later
than ten (10) calendar days prior to the anticipated date of filing of such
Registration Statement, to each Shareholder of its intention to effect such
registration and, in the case of each Shareholder, shall include in such
registration all of such Shareholders Registrable Shares with respect to
which the Company has received a written request from such Shareholder for
inclusion therein within ten (10) calendar days after the date of the
Companys notice (a " _Piggyback Registration_ " and any such requesting
Shareholder that has not withdrawn its Registrable Shares from such Piggyback
Registration a " _Piggyback Holder_ " with respect to such Piggyback

 



      
 

 



 

Registration). In the event that a Shareholder makes such written request,
such Shareholder may withdraw its Registrable Shares from such Piggyback
Registration by giving written notice to the Company and the managing
underwriter, if any, at any time at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such Piggyback
Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw any Piggyback Registration
under this Section 3.2(a), whether or not any Shareholder has elected to
include Registrable Shares in such registration. No Piggyback Registration
shall count towards the number of Demand Registrations to which the
Shareholders are entitled under Section 3.1(c).

 



 

(b) If a Piggyback Registration under Section 3.2(a) is proposed to be
underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Shareholders as a part of the
written notice given pursuant to Section 3.2(a). In such event, the lead
underwriter to administer the offering shall be chosen by the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses (subject to and in
accordance with Section 3.7) in connection with any Piggyback Registration,
whether or not any registration or prospectus becomes effective or final or is
terminated or withdrawn by the Company.

 



 

(d) If the registration of Similar Securities giving rise to a right to
Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 is initiated by the
Company for its own account, each Piggyback Holder with respect to such
Piggyback Registration may include all the Registrable Shares it requests in
such Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as such Similar
Securities included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the offering to
which such Piggyback Registration relates involves a firm commitment
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter(s) of such offering advises
the Company and the Piggyback Holders with respect to such Piggyback
Registration in writing that, in its good faith opinion, the total number or
dollar amount of Similar Securities proposed to be sold in such offering and
Registrable Shares requested by such Piggyback Holders to be included therein,
in the aggregate, exceeds the largest number or dollar amount of securities
that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share
offering price), the Company shall include in the applicable registration or
prospectus only such number of securities that in the good faith opinion of
such underwriter(s) can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting
the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per
share offering price), which securities shall be included in the following
order of priority:

 



 

(i) _first_ , the securities that the Company proposes to sell;

 



 

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Shares requested to be included by such
Piggyback Holders and any Similar Securities requested to be included by any
other Persons exercising their contractual rights to piggyback registration,
pro rata (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate number of securities so
requested to be included therein; and

 



 

(iii) _third_ , any securities requested to be included therein by any other
Persons (other than the Company and such Piggyback Holders and

 



      
 

 



 

other Persons with piggyback registration rights), allocated among such
Persons in such manner as the Company may determine.

 



 

(e) If the registration of Similar Securities giving rise to a right to
Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 is initiated by the
Company on behalf of holders of Similar Securities to be sold in an
underwritten offering, the Piggyback Holders with respect to such Piggyback
Registration may include all Registrable Shares requested by them to be
included in such registration in such offering on the same terms and
conditions as any Similar Securities included therein; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the managing underwriter(s) of such offering advises the Company and
such Piggyback Holders in writing that, in its good faith opinion, the total
number or dollar amount of securities to be included therein exceeds the
largest number or dollar amount of securities that can be sold in such
offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering
(including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company
shall include in the applicable registration or prospectus only such number of
securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriter(s) can be sold
without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an
adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities shall be so
included in the following order of priority:

 



 

(i) _first_ , the Similar Securities requested to be included therein by the
holders of such Similar Securities, allocated among such Persons in such
manner as the Company may determine;

 



 

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Shares requested to be included by such
Piggyback Holders, and any Similar Securities requested to be included by any
other Persons exercising their contractual rights to piggyback registration,
pro rata (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate number of securities so
requested to be included therein;

 



 

(iii) _third_ , Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities offered by the Company
for its own account; and

 



 

(iv) fourth, Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities offered by any other
holders of Ordinary Shares or Similar Securities requested to be included
therein (other than the Company and such Piggyback Holders and other Persons
with piggyback registration rights), allocated among such Persons in such
manner as the Company may determine.

 



 

SECTION 3.3 _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Date, if the Company is eligible to use a Form S-3 or
any comparable or successor form or forms for a short-form registration
statement (a " _Short-Form Registration Statement_"), one or more
Shareholders (such Shareholders, the " _Initiating Shelf Holders_ ") may make
a written request (a " _Shelf Notice_ ") to the Company to file a Short-Form
Registration Statement as a Shelf Registration Statement, which Shelf Notice
shall specify the kind and the aggregate amount of Registrable Shares of the
Initiating Shelf Holders to be registered therein and the intended methods of
distribution thereof. Following the delivery of a Shelf Notice, the Company
shall file with the SEC promptly (and, in any event, within sixty (60)

 



      
 

 



 

days following delivery of such Shelf Notice, provided that the Company shall
not be required to make such filing until the first Business Day after the
date on which the Form 8-K amendment contemplated by Section 7.14 of the
Combination Agreement is filed with the SEC) such Shelf Registration
Statement, which shall be an automatic shelf registration statement (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) if the Company qualifies at such
time to file such a Shelf Registration Statement (such Shelf Registration
Statement, the " _Required Shelf Registration Statement_ ") relating to the
offer and sale of all Registrable Shares requested for inclusion therein by
the Initiating Shelf Holders in accordance with the methods of distribution
elected by the Initiating Shelf Holders (to the extent permitted in this
Section 3.3). Any registration made by the Company under this Section 3.3(a)
is referred to in this Agreement as a " _Shelf Registration_." Shareholders
shall not deliver a Shelf Notice, and the Company shall not be required to
effect a Shelf Registration, during the ninety (90) calendar day period
following the effective date of a Registration Statement pursuant to any
Demand Registration or any Piggyback Registration (provided that the number of
Registrable Shares included in such Piggyback Registration was not less than
fifty percent (50%) of the number of Registrable Shares requested by the
Shareholders to be included therein in accordance with Section 3.2(a)) and
shall not be required to effect more than three (3) Shelf Registrations.
Subject to Section 3.5, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
any Required Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof,
or to become automatically effective if such Required Shelf Registration
Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement, and, so long as the
Company remains eligible to register the resale of Registrable Shares on Form
S-3, to keep such Required Shelf Registration Statement effective under the
Securities Act until the earliest of the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
following the initial effective date of such Required Shelf Registration
Statement, such time as all Registrable Shares that could be sold thereunder
have been sold or are no longer outstanding and the Registration Rights
Termination Date (such period of effectiveness, the " _Shelf Period_ ").

 



 

(b) If at any time that a Required Shelf Registration Statement covering
Registrable Shares pursuant to this Section 3.3 is effective the Initiating
Shelf Holders deliver a notice to the Company stating that the Initiating
Shelf Holders intend to effect an offering (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ "), provided
that the aggregate value of the Registrable Shares to be included in such
Marketed Underwritten Offering must be at least twenty-file million
($25,000,000), of all or a portion of their Registrable Shares included by
them on such Required Shelf Registration Statement and stating the number of
Registrable Shares to be included in such Shelf Take-Down, then the Company
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable amend or supplement the applicable
Required Shelf Registration Statement and take such other action as may be
reasonably necessary to facilitate the sale of such Registrable Shares
pursuant to such Shelf Take-Down.

 



 

(c) If the Initiating Shelf Holders elect by written request to the Company, a
Shelf Take-Down shall be in the form of a Marketed Underwritten Offering (an "
_Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ ") and the Company shall amend or supplement
the Required Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose as soon as
practicable. In connection with any such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, the
lead underwriter to administer the offering shall be chosen by the Initiating
Shelf Holders, subject to the prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the Company. The number of Underwritten

 



      
 

 



 

Shelf Take-Downs the Shareholder may make pursuant to Shelf Registrations is
limited to two in any Shelf Period.

 



 

SECTION 3.4 _Termination of Registration Obligation_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the obligation of the Company to register Registrable
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ and maintain the effectiveness of any
Required Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Section 3.1 shall terminate on the first date on which the
Shareholders (i) in the aggregate, hold Shareholder Shares representing less
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Voting Securities (the "
_Registration Rights Termination Date_ ") and (ii) are each able to freely
sell their remaining Shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act without
regard to the volume, manner of sale or filing requirements of such rule, and
as to any Shareholder shall terminate on the earlier of the Registration
Rights Termination Date and the first date on which such Shareholder no longer
holds Registrable Shares.

 



 

SECTION 3.5 _Suspension_. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement with respect to a Demand Registration or a
Shelf Registration would require the Company to make a public disclosure of
material non-public information, which disclosure the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with external legal counsel) would materially
impact the Company or would materially impede, delay or interfere with on the
Companys ability to effect a reasonably imminent material proposed
acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction, then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice
of such determination to the Shareholder, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, such Registration
Statement or any Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus; _provided_ , _however_
, that, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Shareholder, the Company
shall not be permitted to do so for a period of time in excess of ninety (90)
days in the case of any single delay or suspension, and the number of days in
any 12-month period on which such a suspension is in effect shall not exceed
one hundred twenty (120) (except that such number of days shall not exceed
ninety (90) in the 12-month period commencing on the Closing Date (as defined
in the Combination Agreement)). In the event that the Company exercises its
rights under the preceding sentence, the Shareholder shall suspend, promptly
upon receipt of the notice referred to above, the use of any Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus relating to such Demand Registration or Shelf
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Shares.
In the event of such a suspension for which notice is given by the Company
after the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement, the period
specified in clause (A) in Section 3.6(b) (or, in the case of a Required Shelf
Registration Statement, the Shelf Period) shall be extended by the number of
days of such suspension. The Shareholder shall keep confidential the receipt
of any notice under this Section 3.5 and the contents thereof, except as
required pursuant to applicable law, and, during any period of such delay or
suspension, shall not offer or sell or otherwise transfer any Shareholder
Shares or otherwise engage in trading of securities of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, upon the commencement of any
Scheduled Black-Out Period, the Shareholder shall immediately suspend the use
of any Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus in connection with any sale or
offer to sell Registrable Shares until the termination of such Scheduled
Black-Out Period.

 



 

SECTION 3.6 _Registration Procedures_. Subject to Section 3.1(d) and the
Companys right to withdraw or terminate an applicable Piggyback Registration
under Section

 



      
 

 



 

3.2(a), whenever one or more Shareholders shall have requested in accordance
with Section 3.1 or Section 3.2, as applicable, that any Registrable Shares be
registered pursuant to Section 3.1 or Section 3.2, as applicable, the Company
shall:

 



 

(a) use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement with respect to such Registrable Shares within the time periods
therefor specified herein, reasonably cooperate with the Shareholders and each
underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Shares (such
participating Shareholders, " _Selling Holders_ ") and their respective
counsel in connection with any required filings with FINRA and, if such
Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon filing, use
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto (including free writing prospectuses under
Rule 433 under the Securities Act, each, a " _Free Writing Prospectus_ "), the
Company shall furnish to each Selling Holder and each of the managing
underwriter(s), if any, copies of the Registration Statement and all other
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits thereto), including, in the
case of any Selling Holder, upon the reasonable request of such Selling Holder
and to the extent reasonably practicable, all documents that would be
incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein
(other than documents publicly available on the SECs EDGAR system or any
successor system), which Registration Statement and documents proposed to be
filed will be subject to the reasonable review and comment of the Selling
Holders and their counsel ( _provided_ that any comments are given to the
Company promptly upon receipt of such documents and in no event later than
three (3) calendar days after such documents are deemed under Section 3.9 to
have been given to the Selling Holders), at the Selling Holders sole expense;

 



 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement, the Prospectus used in connection therewith (including
Free Writing Prospectuses) and Exchange Act reports as may be necessary to
keep such Registration Statement (other than a Required Shelf Registration
Statement, the effectiveness of which shall be maintained for the Shelf
Period) effective for a period of (A) not less than sixty (60) days, (B) if
such Registration Statement relates to an underwritten offering, such longer
period as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter(s), a Prospectus is
required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Shares
by an underwriter or dealer or (C) such shorter period as will terminate when
all of the Registrable Shares covered by such Registration Statement have been
disposed of in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement (but in any event not before
the expiration of any longer period required under the Securities Act);

 



 

(c) furnish to the Selling Holders and the managing underwriter(s), if any,
such number of conformed copies, without charge, of such Registration
Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, including each preliminary
and final Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus, all exhibits and other
documents filed therewith and such other documents as such Persons may
reasonably request, including in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended method or methods of
distribution thereof set forth in such Registration Statement; and the
Company, subject to the penultimate paragraph of this Section 3.6, hereby
consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or

 



      
 

 



 

supplement thereto by the Selling Holders and the managing underwriter(s), if
any, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Shares
covered by such Prospectus and any such amendment or supplement thereto;

 



 

(d) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Shares
under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the
Selling Holders reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things
that may be necessary or reasonably advisable to enable the Selling Holders to
consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Shares in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof set
forth in the applicable Registration Statement ( _provided_ that the Company
shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
subsection; (ii) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction wherein it is
not so subject; or (iii) take any action which would subject it to general
service of process in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so subject);

 



 

(e) use its reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Shares covered by such
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental agencies, authorities and self-regulatory bodies as may be
necessary or reasonably advisable in light of the business and operations of
the Company to enable the Selling Holders or the managing underwriter(s), if
any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Shares in the United
States in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement;

 



 

(f) promptly notify the Selling Holders and the managing underwriter(s), if
any, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the occurrence of any event or existence
of any fact as a result of which the Prospectus (including any information
incorporated by reference therein) included in such Registration Statement, as
then in effect, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and, as promptly as practicable upon
discovery, prepare and furnish to the Selling Holders a reasonable number of
copies of a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus, or file any other
required document, as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to any
prospective purchasers of such Registrable Shares, such Prospectus shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made;

 



 

(g) promptly notify the Selling Holders and the managing underwriter(s) of any
underwritten offering, if any, (i) when the Registration Statement, any pre-
effective amendment, the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement or any Free Writing
Prospectus has been filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Registration
Statement or to such Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
and (iv) of the suspension of the qualification of

 



      
 

 



 

such securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the institution
of any proceedings for any such purposes;

 



 

(h) enter into underwriting agreements with customary provisions as the
Selling Holders (if such registration is a Demand Registration) or the
managing underwriter(s), if any, reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Shares;

 



 

(i) make available for inspection by the Selling Holders and the Selling
Holders counsel, any managing underwriter(s) participating in any disposition
pursuant to such Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other
agent retained by the Selling Holders or underwriter(s), all financial and
other records, pertinent corporate documents and documents relating to the
business of the Company, and cause the Companys officers, directors,
employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably
requested by the Selling Holders or such underwriter(s), attorney, accountant
or agent in connection with such Registration Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Selling Holder shall, and shall use reasonable efforts
to cause each such underwriter(s), accountant or other agent to (i) enter into
a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company; and (ii) minimize the disruption to the Companys business in
connection with the foregoing;

 



 

(j) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least twelve (12) months beginning with the first
day of the Companys first full calendar quarter after the effective date of
the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

 



 

(k) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related Prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order as
soon as reasonably practicable;

 



 

(l) subject to Section 3.7, cause its senior management to use reasonable
efforts to support the marketing of the Registrable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement pursuant to any Demand Registration or by a Required
Shelf Registration Statement in connection with an underwritten offering
thereunder (including participation in "road shows," to be scheduled in a
collaborative manner so as not to interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company), taking into account the Companys business needs;

 



 

(m) if such Registrable Shares are being sold in an underwritten public
offering, use its reasonable efforts to (i) furnish, on the date the
underwriting agreement is signed and on the date such Registrable Shares are
delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration, a
comfort letter in customary form, addressed to each of the managing
underwriter(s), signed by the independent public accountants who have issued
an audit report on the Companys financial statements included in the
applicable Registration Statement and (ii) provide, on the date of the closing
under the underwriting agreement, a legal opinion of the Companys outside
counsel, addressed to each of the managing underwriter(s), in customary

 



      
 

 



 

form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by legal
opinions of such nature and such other matters as may be reasonably requested
by the managing underwriter(s).

 



 

Subject to the limitations on the Companys ability to delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, a Registration
Statement or a Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Section 3.5,
each Shareholder shall, upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.6(f), promptly
discontinue its disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to any Registration
Statement until such Shareholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented
or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3.6(f). If any Shareholder is so
directed by the Company, such Shareholder shall deliver to the Company (at the
Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, in such
Shareholders possession of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Shares at
the time of receipt of such notice. In the event that the Company shall give
any such notice, the period mentioned in Section 3.6(b) (or, in the case of a
Required Shelf Registration, the Shelf Period), as applicable, shall be
extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date
of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Shareholders
to which such notice was given shall have been given the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.6(f).

 



 

In the case of any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares registered
under a Required Shelf Registration Statement or a Demand Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 3.1(a), or in the case of a Piggyback
Registration under Section 3.2 or a Shelf Registration, (i) all Registrable
Shares or Similar Securities to be included in such offering or registration,
as the case may be, shall be subject to the applicable underwriting agreement
with customary terms (including customary provisions relating to indemnities
and contribution), and neither any Shareholder nor any holder of Similar
Securities may participate in such offering or registration unless such Person
agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided therein; and
(ii) neither any Shareholder nor any holder of Similar Securities may
participate in such offering or registration unless such Person completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up
agreements, underwriting agreements, custody agreements and other documents
reasonably required to be executed in connection therewith, and provides such
other information to the Company and the underwriter(s) as may be reasonably
requested to offer or register such Persons Registrable Shares or Similar
Securities, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) a
Shareholder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties
other than those related to title and ownership of, and power and authority to
transfer, the Registrable Shares of such Shareholder included therein and such
Shareholders intended method of distribution of such Registrable Shares and
as to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in the applicable
Registration Statement, Prospectus or other document in reliance upon, and in
conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company or
the managing underwriter(s) by such Shareholder or its Representatives
pertaining to such Shareholder and (B) the aggregate amount of liability of a
Shareholder pursuant to any indemnification obligation thereunder shall not
exceed the net proceeds received by such Shareholder from such offering. As a
condition to including Registrable Shares in any Registration Statement filed
in accordance with this _Article III_, the Company may require that it shall
have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to the Company from any
underwriter to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors,

 



      
 

 



 

officers and Affiliates to the extent customarily provided by underwriters in
connection with similar securities and offerings.

 



 

After any Shareholder has been notified of its opportunity to include
Registrable Shares in any Piggyback Registration or of a request, in
connection with an offering other than under a Demand Registration, such
Shareholder (i) shall treat the Offering Confidential Information as
confidential information, (ii) shall not use any Offering Confidential
Information for any purpose other than, in the case of a Piggyback
Registration, to evaluate whether to include its Registrable Shares in such
Piggyback Registration and (iii) shall not disclose any Offering Confidential
Information to any Person other than, in the case of a Piggyback Registration,
such of its Representatives as have a need to know such Offering Confidential
Information in connection with such purpose, which Representatives such
Shareholder shall cause to comply with the requirements of this paragraph;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Shareholder may disclose Offering
Confidential Information if such disclosure is required by legal process, but
such Shareholder shall cooperate with the Company to limit the extent of such
disclosure through protective order or otherwise, and to seek confidential
treatment of the Offering Confidential Information. Such Shareholder shall not
offer or sell or otherwise transfer any Shareholder Shares or otherwise engage
in trading of securities of the Company while in possession of Offering
Confidential Information.

 



 

SECTION 3.7 _Registration Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all expenses incidental to
the Companys performance of or compliance with this _Article III_ (the "
_Registration Expenses_ "), including (i) all registration and filing fees
(including (A) with respect to filings required to be made with the SEC, all
applicable securities exchanges and/or FINRA and (B) compliance with
securities or blue sky laws including any fees and disbursements of counsel
for the underwriter(s) in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 3.6(d)); (ii) word processing,
duplicating and printing expenses (including expenses of printing certificates
for Registrable Shares in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository
Trust Company and of printing Prospectuses, if the printing of Prospectuses is
requested by the managing underwriter(s), if any, or by any Shareholder
participating in the applicable offering of Registrable Shares); (iii)
messenger, telephone and delivery expenses; (iv) fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company; (v) fees and disbursements of all independent
certified public accountants (including the fees and disbursements in
connection with any "cold comfort" letters required by this Agreement) and
other special experts, retained by the Company, shall be borne by the Company.
The Company shall, in any event, pay its internal expenses, the expenses of
any annual audit or quarterly review of the Companys financial statements by
the Companys independent certified public accountants, the expenses of any
liability insurance of the Company and the expenses and fees for listing the
Registrable Shares to be registered on the applicable securities exchange. All
underwriting discounts, selling commissions and transfer taxes and fees and
disbursements of counsel and any other advisers or agents of any Shareholders
(collectively, " _Selling Expenses_ ") incurred in connection with the
offering of any Registrable Shares shall be borne by the Shareholders
participating in such offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
not bear any Selling Expenses in connection with its obligations under this
Agreement. All expenses incurred in connection with any "road shows"

 



       
 

 



 

undertaken pursuant to Section 3.6(l) shall be borne in equal proportion by
the Shareholders and the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be
required to pay Registration Expenses for any Demand Registration begun
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) the request for which has been subsequently
withdrawn by the Initiating Holders unless the withdrawal is (i) requested
under the circumstances described in Section 3.5; or (ii) based upon (A) any
fact, circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence that individually or
in the aggregate with all other facts or circumstances, events, changes,
effects or occurrences has a material adverse effect on the Company or (B)
material adverse information concerning the Company that the Company had not
publicly disclosed at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to such registration
request and of which the Company had not otherwise notified, in writing, the
Initiating Holder at the time of such request.

 



 

SECTION 3.8 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 



 

(a) In the case of each offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this
_Article III_, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder and its directors and officers
and each Person, if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such Selling Holder from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, actions or
proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) in respect thereof and expenses
(including reasonable and documented fees of counsel) (collectively, "
_Claims_ ") to which each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar
as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement reached in accordance
with the requirements for consent as provided herein) arise out of or are
based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any preliminary or final
Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such
Registration Statement) contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, (ii) any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any
preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus
incorporated into such Registration Statement), in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (iii) any
violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state
securities law in connection with such offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be liable to any such indemnified party in any such case
to the extent that any such Claims arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement contained in or omission or alleged
omission from such Registration Statement, or preliminary or final Prospectus
(including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration
Statement), or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Selling Holder or any Representative of such Selling Holder expressly for use
therein; _provided_ , _further_ , that that the foregoing indemnity agreement,
with respect to any Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, shall not inure to
the benefit of any such indemnified party if the Person asserting any Claims
against such indemnified party purchased Shareholder Shares and (x) prior to
the time of sale of the Shareholder Shares to such Person (the " _Time of
Sale_ "), the Company shall have notified such Selling Holder that the
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus (as it existed prior to the Time of
Sale) contains an untrue statement of material fact

 



      
 

 



 

or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (y) such untrue
statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
was provided to such Selling Holder in advance of the Time of Sale, and (z)
such corrected preliminary Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus was not
conveyed to such Person at or prior to the Time of Sale. In connection with
any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this _Article
III_, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter, the
officers and directors of such underwriter and each Person, if any, that
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) such underwriter to substantially the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of each Selling Holder by
the Company.

 



 

(b) In the case of each offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant to this
_Article III_, each Selling Holder shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and
officers and each Person, if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company from
and against any Claims to which each such indemnified party may become
subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement
reached in accordance with the requirements for consent as provided herein)
arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any preliminary
or final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into
such Registration Statement) contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or arise out of or
are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of any preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free
Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration Statement), in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each
case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Selling Holder or
any Representative of such Selling Holder expressly for use therein. The
liability of any Selling Holder under the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.8(b) shall be limited to an amount equal to the dollar amount of the net
proceeds received by such Selling Holder from Shareholder Shares sold by such
Selling Holder pursuant to such Registration Statement or Prospectus. In
connection with any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares made pursuant
to this _Article III_, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each
underwriter, the officers and directors of such underwriter and each Person,
if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriter and any other selling
securityholder in such offering (and, in the case of each such other selling
securityholder, such selling securityholders officers and directors and each
Person, if any, that controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such selling
securityholder), to substantially the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification of the Company by each Selling Holder.

 



 

(c) If, for any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section
3.8(a) or Section 3.8(b) are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold
harmless an indemnified party in respect of any Claims referred to therein
other than by the terms of this Section 3.8, then each Indemnifying Party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such

 



      
 

 



 

indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to
statements or omissions that that resulted in such Claims. The relative fault
of such Indemnifying Party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or by
such indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
If, however, the allocation in the first sentence of this Section 3.8(c) is
not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults, but also the relative
benefits of the Indemnifying Party and the indemnified party, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section
3.8(c) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations
referred to in the preceding sentences of this Section 3.8(c). The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above
shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3.9) any reasonable and documented legal or other fees or out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder shall not be liable to contribute any amount in
excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by the Shareholder
from Shareholder Shares sold by the Shareholder pursuant to such Registration
Statement or Prospectus.

 



 

SECTION 3.9 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under Section 3.8 in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Claim against the indemnified party, such indemnified party
shall notify the Company or the applicable Selling Holder, as the case may be
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of such Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim),
any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ ") promptly after receipt by such indemnified
party of written notice of the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
provide a Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the indemnified partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to provide any such copies shall not affect the
indemnification obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 



 

(b) If a Claim is made against an indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses,
to assume the

 



      
 

 



 

defense thereof with separate counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof,
unless the Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially
different defenses for the indemnified party and the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof and as
otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the indemnified party shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Claim, and the indemnified party shall use
reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of a Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. The Indemnifying Party may pay,
settle or compromise a Claim without the written consent of the indemnified
party, so long as such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) does not
subject the indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

 



 

SECTION 3.10 _Rule 144; Regulation S_. The Company will use its reasonable
efforts to timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by
the SEC thereunder, and to take such further action as the Shareholders may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the

necessary, to identify selling securityholders thereunder. To the extent this
Agreement refers to the filing or effectiveness of other Registration
Statements by or at a specified time and the Company has, in lieu of then
filing such Registration Statements or having such Registration Statements

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

SECTION 4.1 _Shareholder Actions_. Any determination, consent or approval of,
or notice or request delivered by, or any other action of, any Shareholder
shall be made by, and shall be valid and binding upon, all Shareholders, if
made by one or more Shareholders Beneficially Owning a majority of the
Shareholder Shares. The Company shall be entitled to demand from time to time
and at any time, from the Shareholders, evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Company of such majority approval before proceeding with the Companys
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.2 _Joint and Several Liability_. The Shareholders hereby agree that
all representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, liability and
obligations under this Agreement are joint and several to the Shareholders,
and each Shareholder will be liable to the fullest extent provided for in this
Agreement for any breach, default, liability or other obligation of each of
the other Shareholders.

 



 

SECTION 4.3 _Injunctive Relief_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it would
be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the other parties shall, in
addition to any other rights or remedies which they may have, be entitled to
such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or
defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement specifically
enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.4 _Assignments_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. None of the parties may directly or indirectly assign any
of their rights or delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties, other than a transfer
by a Shareholder to a Permitted Transferee (as defined in the Shareholders
Agreement), which shall not require the prior written consent of the other
parties. Any purported direct or indirect assignment in violation of this
Section 4.4 shall be null and void ab initio.

 



 

SECTION 4.5 _Amendments; Waiver_. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set
forth in writing and duly executed by (i) the Company, where enforcement of
the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought against the
Company; or (ii) each Shareholder, where enforcement of the amendment,
modification, discharge or waiver is sought against the Shareholders. Any such
waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by
the Company or the Shareholders of a breach of or a default under any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the failure to exercise or delay in exercising
any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver of any
other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein
provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights
or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 



 

SECTION 4.6 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to
be given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given to a party when (i) delivered to the appropriate address by hand
