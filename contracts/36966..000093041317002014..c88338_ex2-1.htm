Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2013 held, all licenses, franchises, permits
and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith),
except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization
(nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with and are not in material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as would not reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, none of Parent or
any of its affiliates, or to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, employee, agent or other person acting on behalf
of Parent or any of its affiliates, has, directly or indirectly, (a) used any funds of Parent or any of its affiliates for unlawful
contributions, unlawful gifts, unlawful entertainment or other expenses relating to political activity, (b) made any unlawful
payment to foreign or domestic governmental officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns from
funds of Parent or any of its affiliates, (c) violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any similar law or
(d) made any unlawful bribe, unlawful rebate, unlawful payoff, unlawful influence payment, unlawful kickback or other unlawful
payment to any person, private or public, regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, to obtain favorable treatment
in securing business or to obtain special concessions for the Company or any of its affiliates, or is currently subject to any
United States sanctions administered by the OFAC. Parent Bank has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo;
or better. Parent and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in material
default or violation under the Volcker Rule. Section 4.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) all Parent affiliates
and subsidiaries (including Parent) engaged in proprietary trading (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that would be prohibited upon
expiration of any temporary conformance period granted by the Federal Banking Agencies under the Volcker Rule and (ii) all covered
funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that Parent or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries sponsors or invests in that would
be prohibited upon expiration of any temporary conformance period granted by the Federal Banking Agencies under the Volcker Rule.
Parent and its applicable subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of internal controls designed to ensure compliance
by Parent and its subsidiaries with the laws, regulations and regulatory guidance that is applicable to it. For the purpose of
the preceding two sentences, &ldquo;<U>affiliate</U>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<U>subsidiary</U>&rdquo; shall have their respective meanings
under 12 U.S.C. &sect; 1813. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and, since January 1, 2014 have complied,
with all Environmental Laws.</P>

Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not
the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then, if such transaction is consummated, Company shall, on the earlier

of same day funds, a fee equal to $85,000,000 (the &ldquo;<U>Termination Fee</U>&rdquo;); <U>provided</U>, that for purposes of
this Section&nbsp;8.2(a)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to &ldquo;25%&rdquo; shall instead refer

to the contrary, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate amount of
fees payable by Company under this Section&nbsp;8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee. In no event shall Company be required

Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section&nbsp;8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Company shall pay
the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition,
if Company fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.2, then Company shall pay interest on such overdue
amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the &ldquo;prime rate&rdquo; (as announced
by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for
the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.</FONT> The amounts payable by
Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2(a)(i) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or
willful and material breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified
in such section.</P>
