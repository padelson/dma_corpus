AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated May 3, 2017 (this " _Agreement_ "),
between First Horizon National Corporation, a Tennessee corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Capital Bank Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Company_
"), and Firestone Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

A. The parties intend to effect a strategic business combination through the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

B.  Each of the board of directors of Parent (" _Parent Board_ ") and the
board of directors of Merger Sub unanimously has (1) determined that it is in
the best interests of Parent and Merger Sub, and the shareholders of Parent
and Merger Sub, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with
Company providing for the Merger in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), (2) adopted a resolution approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
applicable law on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and has authorized the execution and delivery thereof and (3), in the case of
Parent Board, adopted a resolution recommending that the shareholders of
Parent approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.

  



  

C. The board of directors of Company (the " _Company Board_ ") unanimously
has (1) determined that it is in the best interests of Company and the
stockholders of Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL, (2) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the DGCL on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and has authorized the execution and delivery thereof and
(3) adopted a resolution recommending the plan of merger set forth in this
Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Company (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ").

  



  

D. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger, and as part of a
single integrated transaction for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to be merged
with and into Parent (the " _Second Step Merger_ ", and together with the
Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with Parent as the surviving corporation in the
Second Step Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

  



  

E. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Mergers, taken
together, shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a
plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

F. As a condition to the parties' willingness to enter into this Agreement,
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
stockholders of Company are entering into voting agreements (the " _Company
Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which each such stockholder is agreeing,
among other things, on the terms and subject to the

   

-1- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

conditions of the applicable Company Support Agreement, to vote his, her or
its shares of Company Class A Common Stock in favor of the approval of the
Merger and to take certain other actions in furtherance thereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
 The Merger

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Company at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
terminate. Company will be the Surviving Company, and will continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New
York, at 10:00 a.m. on the third business day (unless the parties agree to
another time or date) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII, other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions (the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, in
connection with the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will duly execute and
deliver a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to the
Delaware Secretary of State for filing under Section 251 of the DGCL. The
parties will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL, and
the Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is filed in
the office of the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such later date or time
as Parent and the Company agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger; Tax Consequences_. At and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and other applicable law. It is intended that the
Mergers, taken together, shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to
be and is adopted as "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code.

  



  

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Company, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 2.4(e), each share of Company Class A Common Stock,
par value $0.01 (" _Company Class A Common Stock_ ") and each share of
Company Class B Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 (" _Company Class B
Non-Voting Common Stock_ " and,

   

-2- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

together with the Company Class A Common Stock, " _Company Common Stock_ "),
in each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except for (1) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company as treasury
stock or otherwise owned by Company or Parent (in each case other than shares
of Company Common Stock (x) held in any Company Benefit Plans or
related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary, custodial or agency capacity or (y) held,
directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted ((x) and
(y), collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")) and (2) Dissenting Shares,
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest:

  



  

(i) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not
revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 (collectively, the " _Cash
Election Shares_ "), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash
Consideration (the " _Cash Consideration_ ");

  



  

(ii) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been effectively
made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 (collectively,
the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of the common stock, par value $0.625 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "
_Stock Consideration_ "); and

  



  

(iii) For each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked
pursuant to Section 2.2 (collectively, the " _Non-Election Shares_ "), the
right to receive such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration as is
determined in accordance with Section 2.1.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

  



  

(i) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient, rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth, of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by (B) the
Parent Share Closing Price.

  



  

(ii) The " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " means the sum, rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a cent, of (A) $7.90 plus (B) the product, rounded to
the nearest one tenth of a cent, of 1.75 (the " _Share Ratio_ ") times the
Parent Share Closing Price.

  



  

(iii) The " _Merger Consideration_ " means the Cash Consideration and/or
Stock Consideration described in Section 1.5(a), as applicable.

  



  

(c) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
," it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old_ _Certificate_
" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements
relating to the

   

-3- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with, and
subject to, Sections 1.5(a), 2.1 and 2.2, (ii) cash in lieu of a fractional
share which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.4(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.4. Old Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at
Parent's option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively,
referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), representing the Stock
Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor) or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, upon the
surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.4, without
any interest thereon. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or
distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
each of the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Share Ratio to give holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this sentence
shall be construed to permit Parent or Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company
or Parent or by any direct or indirect Company or Parent Subsidiary (in each
such case other than Exception Shares) prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger Consideration nor
any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

1.6 _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a
person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of, or
otherwise consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and who is entitled to
and has properly demanded appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, has complied in all respects with Section 262
of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in Section 1.5(a), unless and until
such person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to
perfect such person's right to appraisal or payment under the DGCL, at which
time such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(a), without interest,
payable upon surrender of the Old Certificates (and related documents) in
accordance with this Article I, and such Shares shall not be deemed
Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other
rights with respect to such Shares. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such person shall have
effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such person's

prompt notice of receiving any demands for appraisal, withdrawals or attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law with respect to appraisal rights. Company shall not,

or agree to make, any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal,
offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Company to purchase shares

_Company Stock Option_ "), shall fully vest (to the extent unvested) and
shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (a " _Parent
Stock Option_ ") to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (B) the
Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the

_divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 1.9(a), each such Parent Stock Option assumed and converted pursuant
to this Section 1.9(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the

Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under

each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable tax
withholdings.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of the

than three (3) business days following the Closing Date), if and to the
extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be registered and issuable under Parent Stock Options, Parent shall file a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4, a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Stock Options and shall maintain the

(" _Tennessee Articles of Merger_ ") relating to the Second Step Merger and

Article II 
  
 Exchange of Shares

  



  

2.1 _Proration._

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be entitled to receive
the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a) shall be equal to the
quotient of (i) the Cash Component divided by (ii) the Per Share Cash
Consideration (such quotient, the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "). All other
shares of Company Common Stock (excluding the shares of Company Common Stock
to be cancelled as provided in Section 1.5(d) and Company Restricted
Stock Awards) shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of the Cash
Consideration shall equal $410,535,300 (the " _Cash Component_ ").

  



  

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) business days) after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be
deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time)
(the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all
Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares

   

-7- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election
Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election
Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a),
whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with
the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

  



  

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

  



  

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares
held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election
Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a),
whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with
the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

  



  

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number
exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which
is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Stock
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration.

  



  

2.2  _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6 and 2.1 (a " _Holder_ ") shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to
submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

  



  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an "Election") (i) the number
of shares of Company

   

-8- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires
to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash
Election.

  



  

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of
Election_ "), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

  



  

(c) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing
date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts
to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election
Deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline
is referred to herein as the " _Election Period_ ".

  



  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing
all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered
national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the
United States. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the
parties, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in
which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date
which the parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business
days preceding the Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to
issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before,
and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

  



  

(e) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company nor the Exchange Agent
being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-
Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

  



  

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Old Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections
shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance
by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method
of issuance and delivery of New Certificates representing the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

2.3 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the
" _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.4(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in an
amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (except for the
New Certificates, Per Share Cash Consideration, or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares attributable to any Dissenting Shares) (such cash and New
Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ , that
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates and any shortfall as
a result of investment losses shall be promptly replenished by Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

  



  

2.4 _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of one or more Old
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I
and that has not theretofore submitted its Old Certificates with a Form of
Election, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration which such holder shall have become
entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and
2.2, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.4(b) (or, in the case of book-entry shares, such other transmittal
instructions as applicable to effective delivery and surrender of Old
Certificate in book entry form). From and after the Effective Time and the
completion of the allocation procedures set forth in Section 2.1, upon
proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly

   

-10- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

completed letter of transmittal or Form of Election, as applicable, duly
executed (or upon proper delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
book-entry shares), the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing the Stock Consideration to which such holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance
with, and subject to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2 and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (A) Cash Consideration which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old
Certificates in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2,
(B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates
pursuant Section 2.4(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated by Sections 2.2 and 2.4, each Old
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the applicable Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of
dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.4.

  



  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in
accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the Stock
Consideration which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after giving
effect to Section 6.11).

  



  

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is
entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

   

-11- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

(e) No New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the
ten (10) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.5 and subject to Section 2.1.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Company who
have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 and
any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

  



  

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

Article III 
  
 Representations and Warranties of Company

  



  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b)
the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article
III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of
this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2017, Company's

disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (" _BHC
Act_ "). Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects. Company is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent, Company or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect

hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C)
changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in
economic or market (including equity, credit, and debt

markets, as well as changes to interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such

earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not including the
underlying causes thereof, (E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party's relationship with its

3.5 _Reports_.

  



  

(a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished, as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2014 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (vi) any foreign
regulatory authority and (vii) any SRO ((i) - (vii), collectively, "

required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules
or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would
not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the

    

-17- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Company. Except for
examinations of Company and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency
in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has
pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Company, investigation
into the business or operations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2014, except where such proceedings or investigation would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Company. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to
any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Company.

  



  

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, since January 1, 2014 (the " _Company Reports_ ") is publicly
available. No such Company Report, at the time filed, furnished or
communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Company Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Company has failed in any
respect to make the certification required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company
Reports.

  



  

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Company Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and
(iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements
or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2014, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed
Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed

    

-18- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

as independent public accountants of Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with Company on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Company, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance
sheet of Company, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Company included in the Company
Form 10-Q (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since March 31, 2017, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Company and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Company. Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of
Company's Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of
Company, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Company's internal
controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Company's auditor and audit committee and a copy has been
previously made available to Parent. To the knowledge of Company, there is no
reason to believe that Company's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  



  

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, all swaps, caps,
floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
derivative transactions (each, a " _Derivative Contract_ "), whether entered
into for its own account, or for the account of one or more of its
Subsidiaries or their respective customers, were entered into (i) in
accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with counterparties believed to
be financially responsible at the time; and each Derivative Contract
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of it or one of its
Subsidiaries, as the

    

-19- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

case may be, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Enforceability Exception), and are in full force and effect. Except as would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company, neither Company nor its Subsidiaries, nor
to its knowledge any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its
obligations under any Derivative Contract.

  



  

(e) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Company, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Company, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or written
claim that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws,
fiduciary duties or similar violation by Company or any of its officers,
directors or employees to the Company Board or any committee thereof or, to
the knowledge of Company, to any director or officer of Company.

  



  

(f) The allowance for loan losses as of March 31, 2017, was in the reasonable
judgment of management of Company or its applicable Subsidiaries, adequate
under the standards established by applicable Governmental Entities.

  



  

3.7 _Broker 's Fees_. Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees,
commissions or finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than Sandler O'Neill and
Partners, L.P. and UBS Securities LLC. Company has disclosed to Parent as of
the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the

--- 

    

other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Company, or challenge the validity
or propriety of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Mergers, would apply
to Parent or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be
material to either Company or any of its " _Significant Subsidiaries_ " (as
such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

  



  

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any

Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,

The federal income Tax Returns of Company and its Subsidiaries for all years
up to and including December 31, 2012 have been examined by the

which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving
effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a
material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened
(in writing) disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings
regarding any material Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Company and its Subsidiaries. In the last six years, neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any jurisdiction that the
jurisdiction believes that Company or any of its Subsidiaries was required to
file any Tax Return that was not filed. Company has made available to Parent
true, correct, and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests,
closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes
requested or executed in the last six years. There are no Liens for material
Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Company and its Subsidiaries). Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the
common parent of which was Company) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of
any person (other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or
otherwise as part of a "plan (or

series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the

under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years
has Company been a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

Company Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit
Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the

Article IV 
  
 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

  



  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub to Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth
as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by Parent that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of this Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of
this Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other
sections of this Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other
sections or (ii) as disclosed in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2017
(the " _Parent Form 10-K_ ") and Parent's Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A
filed with the SEC on March 23, 2017 (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures

contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to Company as
follows:

  



  

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company under the BHC Act. Merger Sub is a corporation duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent. True and complete copies of the Restated Charter of Parent, as
amended (" _Parent Charter_ "), and Bylaws of Parent (" _Parent Bylaws_ "),
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have been made available by
Parent to Company.

  



  

(b) Except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 4.1(b) only,
as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, each Significant Subsidiary
of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Parent Subsidiary to pay dividends or
distributions, except, in the case of a Parent Subsidiary that is a regulated
entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable
to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Parent Subsidiary that is an insured depository institution are insured by
the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted
by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of
such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 400,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value

stock or other voting securities of Parent are issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding, other than (i) 233,883,250 shares of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding, including 1,045,362 shares of Parent Common Stock

Common Stock granted under a Parent Stock Plan (" _Parent Deferral Stock Unit

Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to future grants under the Parent Stock

All of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and Merger

shares of Parent Common Stock, with no personal liability for the acts or
debts of the Parent, except that the holder thereof may become personally
liable by reason of the shareholder's own acts or conduct. There are no
issued or outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have
the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Parent or of Merger
Sub may vote. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or
subordinated debt securities of Parent or Merger Sub are issued or
outstanding. Other than Parent Stock Options and Parent Restricted Stock Unit
Awards, in each case, issued prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or
other commitments or agreements obligating Parent or Merger Sub to issue,
transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities.

  



  

(b) There are no Voting/Transfer Agreements in effect pursuant to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation to the
voting or transfer of the Parent Common Stock or other equity interests of
Parent.

  



  

(c) All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at
the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any
business other than (i) incident to its formation for the sole purpose of
carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in
relation to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each Parent
Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable (except, with respect to Parent Subsidiaries that are insured
depository institutions, as provided under any provision of applicable state
law

    

-34- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

comparable to 12 U.S.C. § 55) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Parent Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

  



  

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers have been duly and validly approved by the Parent
Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub. The Parent Board has
determined that the Mergers, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, are in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders, and has
directed that the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger be submitted to its shareholders for approval at a duly held meeting
of such shareholders and has adopted resolutions to the foregoing effect. The
board of directors of Merger Sub has determined that the Mergers, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, are in the best interests of
Merger Sub and its sole shareholder and has adopted a resolution to the
foregoing effect. Parent, as Merger Sub's sole shareholder, has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at a duly held meeting or
by unanimous written consent. Except for (i) the approval of the issuance of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement by a majority of the votes
cast by holders of outstanding Parent Common Stock at the Parent Meeting (the
" _Requisite Parent Vote_ "), (ii) the adoption and approval of the Bank
Merger Agreement by the board of directors of Parent Bank and Parent, as
Parent Bank's sole shareholder and (iii) the adoption of resolutions to give
effect to the provisions of Section 6.12 in connection with the Closing, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). Subject to the receipt of the
Requisite Parent Vote, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger have been validly authorized and, when issued, will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of Parent
will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

  



  

(b) Subject to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, nor the consummation
by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof,
will (i) violate any provision of the Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws, the
Merger Sub Articles, or the Merger Sub Bylaws, or (ii) assuming that the
consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained
and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance, rule,

under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations which would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

  



  

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the NYSE and the NASDAQ, (ii) the
filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal
Reserve Board under the BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and
notices, (iii) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as

Section 4.4 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and approval of such

the TBCA, and the filing of the Bank Merger Certificates, (vii) the filing of
any notices or other filings under the HSR Act, if necessary or

or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in
connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement and the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on
the NYSE, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Parent of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Parent of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank
Merger). No consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with the execution and
delivery by Merger Sub of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent is
not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and
consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger
and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

  



  

4.5 _Reports_.

  



  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2014 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations
of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory
Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would
not reasonably be likely to

    

-36- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Parent. Except for examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or operations of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014 except where such
proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Parent. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception
by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to
any examinations or inspections of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

  



  

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2014
(the " _Parent Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent Report, at
the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all Parent Reports filed or furnished under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302
or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent Reports.

  



  

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and
(iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements
or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2014, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of

   

-37- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet
of Company, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in the Parent
Form 10-K (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since December 31, 2016, or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent. Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
of Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of
Parent's Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of
Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls
over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Parent's auditors and audit committee and a copy has been
previously made available to Company. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no
reason to believe that Parent's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  



  

(d) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion
or written claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or

   

-38- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities laws, fiduciary duties or similar violation by Parent
or any of its officers, directors, or employees to the Parent Board or any
committee thereof or, to the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer
of Parent.

  



  

4.7 _Broker 's Fees_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees,
commissions or finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Barclays Capital Inc.
and Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC.

  



  

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

  

  



  

(a) Since December 31, 2016, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

  



  

(b) Since December 31, 2016, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Parent and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business.

  



  

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

  



  

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent, or challenge the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to
Parent or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be
material to either Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

  



  

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all material
Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be
filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all
material respects. All material Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether
or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely
paid. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or
other third party. The federal income Tax Returns of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for all years up to and including December 31, 2012 have been
examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable
period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions
or waivers, has expired. No

   

-39- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been proposed,
asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
pending or threatened (in writing) disputes, claims, audits, examinations or
other proceedings regarding any material Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries
or the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2013 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, and to the
knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such
necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and
are not in material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as

opportunity to comment, other than any portions of material filed in
connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary information filed under a claim of confidentiality (except any
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information (but not any
confidential supervisory information) of Company that is necessary for Parent
to prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in
order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that Parent
shall request confidential treatment of any such information, permit Company
to control the defense of any challenge to such confidential treatment request
and will not release any such information publicly pursuant to Freedom of
Information Act requests or similar rules without Company's consent). The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in any such meetings and
conferences.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, Company and their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in this Section
6.1 or otherwise or to agree to any conditions in respect of any approvals
required hereunder that would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse
effect with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_
").

  



  

(d) Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders/stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4
or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Company
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment
or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated

   

-50- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to the respective stockholders/shareholders of Company or
Parent and at the time of the Parent Meeting and the Company Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading, and (iii) any applications, notices and filings required in order
to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will, at the time each is filed,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Each of Parent and Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement.

  



  

(e) Parent and Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood
that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1, Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the furnishing of information and by making employees
reasonably available) as is reasonably requested by Parent in order to
comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Financial Protection Act stress testing program applicable to Parent
and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

6.2 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and
each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal business
operations, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may
reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any interference with the other party's regular business operations
during any such access. Neither Parent nor Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where

   

-51- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parent's
or Company's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and Company shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated February 23, 2017, between Parent and Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

6.3 _Company Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) Company shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company COI
and Company Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a special meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger. Except to the extent specifically contemplated in Section 6.3(b) in
the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change, each of Company and the Company
Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of
Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its
stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve the plan of Merger set
forth in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Company
shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite
Company Vote.

  



  

(b) The Company Board (and each committee thereof) shall not: (1) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose, resolve or declare its
intent to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation;
(2) recommend or declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; or (3) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement (any action
described in sub-clauses (1)-(3) above, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"). However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a material breach of the other terms of this Agreement, and the Company
Board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with an
Acquisition

   

-52- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Proposal would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, then in submitting this Agreement to its
stockholders, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may
not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its Adverse Recommendation Change to its
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not take any
actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least three (3)
business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and
a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken by the Company Board in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe
in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Company Board takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than
not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred
to in this Section 6.3.

  



  

(c) Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to solicit
additional proxies if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting,
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Company at the Company
Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Company of such obligation. Company shall only be required
to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.3(c).

  



  

6.4 _Parent Shareholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) The Parent Board has resolved to recommend to Parent's shareholders that
they approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and will submit to its shareholders the proposed issuance of the
Parent Common Stock and any other matters required to be approved by its
shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. Parent
shall duly take, in accordance with applicable law, the Parent Charter, and
the Parent Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Parent Vote (the " _Parent Meeting_ "). The Parent Board will use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the Requisite
Parent Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement). Parent shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably

   

-53- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

 acceptable to Company to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Requisite Parent Vote. Company and Parent shall
cooperate to schedule and convene the Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting
on the same date.

  



  

(b) Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting to solicit additional
proxies, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite Parent Vote. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Parent Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Meeting, for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Parent of such obligation. Parent shall only be required to adjourn or
postpone the Parent Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 6.4(b).

  



  

6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly
as practicable, (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may
be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and
the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

6.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Company shall cause the shares of Class A Common Stock of Company to be
delisted from the NASDAQ prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

6.7 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_
"), Parent shall provide the employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as they are
employed following the Effective Time, with the following: (i) an annual base
salary or wages and target annual cash incentive opportunities, as
applicable, that are, in each case, no less than the annual base salary or
wages and target annual cash incentive opportunities, as applicable, in effect
for each such Continuing Employee immediately

   

-54- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

 prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding any severance
benefits, frozen benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries or benefit
plans that exclusively provide benefits to grandfathered employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries). Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment
terminates during the Continuation Period with severance benefits no less
than the severance benefits set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, determined (A) by taking into account such Continuing
Employee's service with Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessor
entities) prior to the Closing Date and with Parent and its Subsidiaries on
and after the Closing Date, and (B) without taking into account any
reduction after the Closing in the compensation paid to such Continuing
Employee.

  



  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such Continuing Employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan that
provides health care benefits (including medical, dental and vision), to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such Continuing Employees with
Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, or (C) for
purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered
benefits.

  



  

(c) If requested by Parent in writing at least twenty (20) business days
prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by Company (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Company and Parent shall take any and all actions as
may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or
Parent 401(k) Plan to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of
"eligible rollover distributions" (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), Parent Common
Stock or a combination thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed to such Continuing Employee from a Company 401(k) Plan. Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been
terminated

   

-55- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 6.7(c); _provided_
that, prior to amending or terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, Company shall
provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to
Parent for review and comment (and shall consider in good faith any such
comments).

  



  

(d) On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or
communication materials with respect to employment, compensation or benefits
matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior
prompt review and comment of the other party, and the party seeking to
distribute any such notice or communication shall consider in good faith
revising such notice or communication to reflect any comments or advice that
the other party timely provides.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Company,
Company, Parent, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Company, Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of
Company and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any Company Benefit Plans or (ii)
matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
consideration and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent and the
Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by

   

-56- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

applicable law; _provided_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary
form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by Company or its Subsidiaries and any similar policies
covering fiduciaries under the Company Benefit Plans ( _provided_ , that
Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current
annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Company for such insurance (the
" _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance that, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of
Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail"
policy under Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy and
similar policy covering fiduciaries under the Company Benefit Plans providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed, on an annual basis, the Premium Cap. If a "tail policy" is
purchased as provided above, Parent shall maintain in full force and effect
and not cancel such "tail policy".

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages
in any similar transaction, then in each case, Parent or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company will expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously entered into by
Company in connection with a merger, acquisition or other
business combination, the provisions of this Section 6.8 shall apply to
directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor
entities previously acquired by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Company, Parent and Company under this
Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely
affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the
benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the affected
Company Indemnified Party.

   

-57-

--- 

     

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest Parent or the Surviving Company with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other
party who makes any such request.

  



  

6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and Company shall each promptly advise the
other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that
has had or is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, either individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect
to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section
6.10 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied.

  



  

6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any
such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of
the foregoing, (i) starting with the third quarter of 2017, the Company Board
shall cause its regular quarterly dividend record dates and payment dates for
Company Common Stock to be similar to the regular quarterly dividend record
dates and payment dates for Parent Common Stock (i.e., Company shall move its
dividend record and payment dates for the third quarter of 2017 to
approximately June 9 and July 3, respectively) and (ii) the Parent Board shall
thereafter and until the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement,
only pay dividends on the Parent Common Stock on substantially the same
record and payment date schedules as have been utilized in the past.

  



  

6.12 _Parent Board_. Parent shall take all appropriate action so that, as of
the Effective Time, the number of directors constituting the Parent Board
shall be increased by two (2) members, one (1) of whom shall be Mr. R. Eugene
Taylor (the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Company) and one
(1) of whom shall be selected by agreement between Company and Parent prior to
the Closing from the other members of the Company Board, in each case,
subject to such individuals completing Parent's director and officer
questionnaire form, together with such supporting documentation or other
information that Parent may reasonably request.

   

-58-

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, after the date
hereof and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the event
Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Company shall have provided such
information to Parent, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company. Company will,
and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly (and in any event within one
(1) business day) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Parent promptly (and in any event within one (1)
business day) advised of any related substantive developments, discussions
and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or
revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Company shall
(1) withdraw and terminate access that was granted to any person (other than
the parties to this Agreement and their respective affiliates and
representatives) to any "data room" (virtual or physical) that was
established in connection with a transaction involving Company and (2) use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board, to enforce any existing confidentiality or (to the
extent separate from a confidentiality agreement) standstill agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof and, in accordance therewith, cause any person (other than a party to
this Agreement, its affiliates and representatives) to return or destroy non-
public information regarding Company or any of its affiliates in
connection with a potential transaction involving Company. During the term of
this Agreement, Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to on
its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section
6.13(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Company and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or 

   

-59-

--- 

    

voting securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, either
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning more
than 25% of any class of equity or voting securities of Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, either individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Company, or (iii) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination,
reorganization involving Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, either
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of Company, except, in each case, any sale of whole
loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any _bona
fide_ internal reorganization.

  



  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  



  

6.14 _Public Announcements_. Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such
joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement
required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a

withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the
extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.15 _Change of Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of
effecting the Mergers if and to the extent requested by Parent, and Company
agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may
reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the
amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement,
(ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect to
Company's stockholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to
be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to
be prevented or materially delayed.

  



  

6.16 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either Company or Parent shall have failed
to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at the duly
convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no party
shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of
this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in
a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders/shareholders or (ii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect

transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section
6.16) to its stockholders/shareholders for approval or adoption.

that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of
Parent and Company shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If
any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Company will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  



  

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Company and Parent agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk
of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.18. The Boards of Directors of Parent and of Company, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly after the date of
this Agreement, and in any event prior to (i) the Effective Time, take all
such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (x) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards and (y) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any Company Insiders
who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of
Parent or of the Surviving Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

  



  

6.19 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to
question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated
hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent, Company, or
their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to
enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own expense in
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Company
and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed
without

Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  



  

6.20 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Parent, the Surviving
Company or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Second

any debt of Company Bank, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and
other instruments required for the due assumption of Company's or Company
Bank's outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each

of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

6.22 _Company Bank Pre-Closing Dividend_. Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Company Bank to prepare and file any applications,
notices and filings required by Company's or Company Bank's federal or state
regulatory agencies to permit Company Bank to make a distribution of cash in
an amount requested by Parent (which amount may not exceed the amount of the
aggregate Cash Consideration) to Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If Parent so requests no later than twenty (20) business days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause Company Bank to make a distribution of cash in an amount requested
by Parent (which amount may not exceed the lesser of (x) the amount of cash
Company Bank may, in Company's reasonable determination, distribute to
Company based on its available cash on hand and (y) the amount, if any,
previously approved by Company's and Company Bank's federal or state
regulatory agencies) to Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no
event shall the making of such distribution or the receipt of any regulatory
approval contemplated by this Section 6.22 be a condition to or delay the
Closing.

  



  

6.23 _Company Cooperation_. Company shall cooperate by executing and
delivering representations contained in certificates of officers of Company,
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Company's and Parent's
counsel, in connection with (i) any tax opinion or description of the U.S.

Article VIII 
  
 Termination

  



  

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Company:

  



  

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and Company in a written instrument;

  



  

(b) by either Parent or Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the
failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

   

-65- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

  

(c) by either Parent or Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

  



  

(d) by either Parent or Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true),
would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the case may be,
and which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date and forty-
five (45) days following written notice to Company, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, or
by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

  



  

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, Company or the Company Board (A) effects an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (B) materially breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section
6.13; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent
or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Company Board recommends that the
stockholders of Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer
or otherwise fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender
offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision
or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

  



  

8.2  _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or Company
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Parent, Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 3.7, Section 4.7,
Section 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (and any relevant
definitions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made

  

   

-66- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

known to senior management of Company or shall have been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn) a _bona fide _ Acquisition Proposal with respect to Company and
(A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been
obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then, if such
transaction is consummated, Company shall, on the earlier of the date it
entered into such definitive agreement or the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$85,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes
of this Section 8.2(a)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

  



  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of termination (and in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum
aggregate amount of fees payable by Company under this Section 8.2 shall be
equal to the Termination Fee. In no event shall Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against Company for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Company shall pay the costs and
expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if Company fails to pay the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Company shall pay interest on such
overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto)
in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid. The amounts payable by Company pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the
case of fraud or willful and material breach, shall be the sole monetary
remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such section.
