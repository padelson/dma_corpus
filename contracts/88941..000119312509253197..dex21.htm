pursuant to Section 1.6(a) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

(v) " _Series A Escrow Amount_ " shall mean a number equal to the product of
(A) the Per Share Series A Escrow Consideration by (B) the number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(vi) " _Total Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to (a) $180,000,000,
minus (b) Excess Transaction Expenses minus (c) the Shareholders
Representative Funds; and

(vii) " _Total Series A Closing Consideration_ " shall mean a number equal to
the product of (A) the Per Share Series A Closing Consideration multiplied by
(B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to pay any amounts
pursuant to Section 1.5 and Section 1.6(a) hereunder to the holders of
Company Capital Stock and Vested Company Options in excess of the Total Merger
Consideration. To the extent that, during the Pre-Closing Period, there is a
change in the conversion ratio of the Series B Preferred Stock, or the number
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, or any other event which
would cause the payments contemplated by Section 1.5 and Section 1.6(a) to be
in excess of the Total Merger Consideration, then the amounts contemplated to
be so paid as set forth therein shall be proportionately or equitably adjusted
to give effect to any such change or event such that the aggregate payments
required to be made pursuant to such Section 1.5 and Section 1.6(a) shall not
exceed the amount of the Total Merger Consideration.

1.6 Company Options.

(a) Parent shall not assume any Vested Company Options in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Rather, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger, without any action on the part of any holder of any Company
Options and pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans, each
Vested Company Option shall be cancelled, and the holder of each
Vested Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto: (i) an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the excess of (1) the Per Share Common Closing
Consideration, less (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Company Option, 



 

4  multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Vested Company Option (such amount, the " _Option Payment_ ," and the sum
total of all payments to holders of Vested Company Options pursuant to this
Section 1.6(a) shall be referred to collectively as the " _Aggregate Option
Payment_ "); and (ii) upon release pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Per Share
Common Escrow Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the distribution and amount of the Per Share Common Escrow Consideration
is subject to reduction to satisfy indemnification obligations in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and Article 9 of this Agreement. An
amount of cash equal to the Aggregate Option Payment shall be delivered by
Parent promptly after the Effective Time to the Company. Within five Business
Days following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall distribute to
each holder of cancelled Vested Company Options an amount equal to his or her
Option Payment.

(b) The terms of each outstanding unvested Company Option shall be adjusted
as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unvested Company
Option that is then outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans shall be
converted, replaced, substituted or assumed by Parent in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the stock option agreements by
which such Company Option is evidenced (the " _Substituted Options_ "). Parent
shall assume the Company Stock Option Plans at the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall result in Parent having "Assumed" the Company
Options within the meaning of the Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. All
rights with respect to Company Common Stock under each Substituted Option
then outstanding shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall convert, replace, substitute or assume
each such Substituted Option in accordance with the terms and conditions (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company Stock Option Plans
under which it was originally issued and the terms and conditions of the stock
option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after the Effective Time,
(i) each Substituted Option may be exercised solely for shares of Parent
Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
Substituted Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Substituted Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest
whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such
Substituted Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price
under such Substituted Option by the Option Exchange Ratio and rounding up to
the nearest cent, and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any such
Substituted Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Substituted
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged. The term " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "
shall be equal to the fraction (rounded to the third decimal point) obtained
by dividing the Per Share Common Closing Consideration by the Parent Stock
Price. " _Parent Stock Price_ " shall mean the average of the closing sales
prices for one share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market on the five trading days ending three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(c) The Company shall take all requisite action to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.6, including making any changes to the Company
Stock Option Plans as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree
are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.



 

5 1.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders
of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as Company Shareholders, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
with respect to all shares of such Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books
after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate
previously representing any shares of Company Capital Stock (a " _Company
Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.8.

1.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will
deliver to Parent a spreadsheet setting forth: (i) the names of all the
Company Shareholders and holders of Company Options and their respective
addresses and, where available, taxpayer identification numbers; (ii) the
number and class or series of shares of Company Capital Stock held by, or
subject to the Company Options held by, such Persons and, in the case of
outstanding shares, the respective certificate numbers, and, in the case of
outstanding Company Options, the respective instrument numbers and plan or
agreement pursuant to which such options were granted; (iii) the exercise
price per share in effect for each Company Option; (iv) the amount of cash
payable to each Company Shareholder in exchange for the shares of Company
Capital Stock held by such Persons (and amount of cash, if any, required to be
deducted and withheld from such Persons for Taxes); (v) the amount of cash
payable to each holder of a Vested Company Option in exchange for the
Vested Company Option held by such Persons (and amount of cash, if any,
required to be deducted and withheld from such Persons for Taxes); (vi) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to, and exercise price of,
each option to acquire Parent Common Stock issuable to each holder of
unvested Company Options and whether such option is an incentive stock option
or non-qualified stock option under the Code (and amount of cash required to
be deducted and withheld from such Persons for Taxes); and (vii) each
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share and the interest in dollar terms of
each Effective Time Holder in the Escrow Fund (such spreadsheet, the " _Merger
Consideration Allocation Schedule_ "). The Company shall deliver a copy of
the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule to the Shareholders
Representative.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Promptly, but in no event later than
one Business Day, after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders
of Company Stock Certificates immediately available funds in an amount not
less than the amount necessary to make the payments for the shares of the
Company Capital Stock contemplated by Section 1.5 (such amount, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates a
letter of transmittal in customary form, and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company 



 

6  Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, each holder of a Company Stock
Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration
payable at Closing with respect to the shares formerly represented by such
Company Stock Certificate as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.
All Company Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Company Stock
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of the Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Parent shall
deliver a copy of the letter of transmittal to the Shareholders
Representative.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not
theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with
this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
satisfaction of their claims for the consideration relating thereto.

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any portion of the Exchange Fund properly delivered to any public official
as required by any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
Legal Requirement. 

1.9 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who, pursuant to
Chapter 13 of the CGCL or any successor provision, has the right to dissent to
the Merger and demand payment for such shares and has not failed to perfect,
withdrawn or lost such rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with
the CGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. If, after the Effective Time, such holder withdraws, fails to
perfect or loses any such right to payment, such holders Dissenting Shares
shall be treated as having been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, such holder would
have otherwise been entitled to receive in accordance with Section 1.5 of
this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Chapter 13 of the CGCL or any respective successor provision to
such provision and as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock and the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand. Except to the extent otherwise required by the CGCL, the Company shall
not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to
such payment or settlement offer.



 

7 1.10 Escrow Fund. Upon the Closing, Parent shall withhold the Escrow Amount
and deliver it to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking
association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held by the Escrow Agent as
collateral (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") and security for the rights of the
Indemnitees under Article 9 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held pursuant to
the provisions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Subject to the next sentence of this Section
1.10, the Escrow Fund shall be held as an indemnification fund by the Escrow
Agent until 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the date that is the first-year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "). In the event any
Indemnitee has made a claim under Article 9 prior to the end of the Escrow
Period, then the Escrow Period shall continue (and the Escrow Agent will
continue to hold only that portion of the Escrow Fund in escrow equal to the
claimed amount) until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event
that the principal terms of this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger are
approved by the Company Shareholders, then all such Company
Shareholders shall, without any further act of any Company Shareholder, be
deemed to have consented to and approved (a) the use of the Escrow Fund as
collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnitees under Article 9 in the
manner set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement and (b) the appointment
of the Shareholders Representative as the representative under the Escrow
Agreement of the Persons receiving Merger Consideration under this Agreement
and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each such Person
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares).

1.11 Shareholders Representative Funds. Upon the Closing, Parent shall pay
to the Shareholders Representative an amount equal to $300,000 to be held by
the Shareholders Representative (the " _Shareholders  Representative
Funds_") in a segregated, non-interest bearing account to be used for the
expenses incurred by the Shareholders Representative while acting on behalf
of the Company Shareholders under the authorization granted in Section 10.1.
Promptly after the resolution of all claims against the Escrow Fund, the
Shareholders Representative will distribute any remaining Shareholders
Representative Funds to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with each
such holders Pro Rata Share. 

1.12 Withholding Taxes. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable to any current or former Company
Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under
the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.13 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Closing, no other Person not disclosed in the Merger Consideration Allocation
Schedule will have a right to acquire any shares of Company Capital Stock
and/or Company Options from the Company. In addition, the shares of

been approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the time such Company Stock Option
Plans or material amendments thereto, as applicable, were approved by the

provisions of the Companys Constituent Documents (for the avoidance of doubt,
as amended by the Charter Amendment);

of the assets owned, used or controlled by the Company;

(d) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or result
in a default under, any provision of any Material Contract, or give any
Person the right to (i) declare a default or exercise any remedy under any

such Material Contract or (iii) cancel, terminate or modify in any material
respect any such Material Contract;

(e) require any filing with, notice to or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Body), except for any such failures to file with, notify or
obtain consent from any Person that would not be material to the Company; or

(f) result in the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance upon or with
respect to any asset owned or used by the Company. 

No filing with, notice to or consent from any Governmental Body is required in
connection with (1) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, or (2) the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
except for (x) the filing of the Charter Amendment and the Agreement of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of California, and (y) the
pre-merger notification filings required pursuant to the HSR Act.

2.6 Financial Statements.

(a) Attached as Part 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule are the following
financial statements (collectively, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "):
(a) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31,
2008 (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") and the related audited consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders deficits and cash flows for the fiscal
year then ended, including any notes thereto, together with the report thereon
of the Companys independent certified public accountants; and (b) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of October 31, 2009 and
the related unaudited consolidated statements of income, stockholders
deficits and cash flows for the nine months then ended (the " _Interim
Balance Sheet_ "). The Company Financial Statements are correct and complete
in all material respects, are consistent with the books and records of the
Company and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
throughout the periods involved (except that the unaudited financial
statements are subject to normal recurring year-end adjustments, the effect of
which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material, and the
absence of notes that, if presented, would not differ materially from the
notes to the Balance Sheet). The Company Financial Statements fairly present
the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations, changes
in shareholders equity and cash flow of the Company as of the respective
dates and for the periods indicated therein. No financial statements of any
Person other than the Company are required by GAAP to be included in
the financial statements of the Company. The Company is not a party to any
off-balance sheet arrangements the purpose or effect of which is to defer,
postpone, reduce or otherwise avoid or adjust the recording of expenses
incurred by Company. 



 

13 (b) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to: (i) provide reasonable assurances that
transactions, receipts and expenditures of the Company are being executed and
made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the
Company Board; (ii) provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

with respect to the Company in respect of any Tax. There are no unsatisfied
Liabilities for Taxes (including Liabilities for interest, additions to tax

deficiency or similar document received by the Company with respect to
any Tax (other than Liabilities for Taxes asserted under any such notice of
deficiency or similar document which are being contested in good faith by the

established). There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of the
Company except liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.

parent. The Company is not, nor has it ever been, a party to or bound by any
tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or
similar Contract. The Company is not liable for the Taxes of any taxpayer
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract
(including any tax allocation agreement, tax sharing agreement or tax
indemnity agreement), or otherwise for any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all tax sharing, tax indemnity or
similar agreements or arrangements to which any of the Company has been
a party have been terminated.

(v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

(g) The Company has withheld all amounts of Taxes required to be withheld from

2.17 Employee and Labor Matters.

(a) Part 2.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Employee
Plan. No Employee Plan benefits individuals who reside outside of the United
States or is subject to laws other than the laws of the United States. The
Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain, sponsor, administer,
contribute to, have any obligation to contribute to, or have any potential
Liability to, and have not at any time in the past maintained, sponsored,
administered or contributed to (i) any employee pension benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not excluded from coverage under
ERISA) for the benefit of Employees or former Employees subject to Sections
412 or 430 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA; or (ii) any
"multiemployer plan" or "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of the
Code or ERISA; (iii) a voluntary employees benefit association (VEBA) within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code; or (iv) a multiple employer
welfare arrangement (MEWA) within the meaning of Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA.

(b) All contributions and premium payments for any period ending on or before

Parent: (i) an accurate and complete copy of all documents setting forth the
terms of each such Employee Plan (including the plan document and all
amendments thereto); (ii) an accurate and complete copy of the annual report

the last three years and all actuarial reports and valuations for the past
three years; (iii) an accurate and complete copy of the most recent summary
plan description, together with each Summary of Material Modifications, if
required under ERISA, with respect to such Employee Plan, and all material
written employee communications relating to such Employee Plan; (iv) if such
Employee Plan is funded through a trust or any third party funding vehicle, an
accurate and complete copy of the trust or other funding agreement (including
all amendments thereto) and accurate and complete copies of the most recent
financial statements thereof; (v) accurate and complete copies of all
Contracts relating to such Employee Plan, including service provider

requested by Parent.

(d) Except as described on Part 2.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company has never had any ERISA Affiliates. The Company has never made a
complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as such term is
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as
such term is defined in Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent
reduction or waiver of such liability).

(e) No Welfare Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not
insured) with respect to any current or former Employee after any such
Employees termination of service (other than (i) benefit coverage mandated by
applicable Legal Requirements, including coverage provided pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code, (ii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as Liabilities
on the Company Financial Statements, and (iii) benefits the full cost of which
are borne by current or former Employees (or the Employees beneficiaries)).
With respect to each Welfare Plan, all claims incurred by the Company are (A)
insured pursuant to a contract of insurance whereby the insurance company
bears any risk of loss with respect to such claims, (B) covered under a
contract with a health maintenance organization (an " _HMO_ "), pursuant to
which the HMO bears the Liability for claims, or (C) reflected as a Liability
or accrued for on the Company Financial Statements.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company with respect to Employee Plans sponsored
or administered by Administaff, and without qualification as to all other
Employee Plans, each of the Employee Plans is and at all times has been
established, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited
to ERISA and the Code. The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
Administaff have performed and complied in all respects with all of 



 

30  their material obligations under and with respect to the Employee Plans
including with their material obligations under any Contract between the
Company and Administaff. To the Knowledge of the Company, no fiduciary of any
Employee Plan has committed a breach of fiduciary duty that would subject the
Company or Parent to any Liability. No individual classified as an independent
contractor has ever been permitted to participate in any Employee Plan with
respect to the period of time so classified.

(g) All Company Options have been appropriately authorized by the Company
Board or an appropriate committee thereof, including approval of the option
exercise price or the methodology for determining the option exercise price
and the substantive option terms. All of such options granted to Employees or
other service providers reflect the fair market value of the Company Common
Stock as determined in good faith by the Company Board and to the extent
applicable in consideration of Section 409A of the Code on the date the option
was granted (within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulation Section
1.421-1(c)). No Company Options have been retroactively granted or the
exercise price of any such option determined retroactively in contravention of
any applicable Legal Requirements.

(h) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service, or has submitted (or under applicable Internal Revenue
Service guidance has remaining time to timely submit without penalty) a
request for such a letter within the applicable remedial amendment period, or
is a prototype plan or a volume submitter plan which relies on an opinion or
advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service for the Employee Plan. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or circumstance exists that would
adversely affect the tax-favored status of any Employee Plan that is intended
to be tax-exempt or provide nontaxable benefits. The Company has never
incurred, and no fact exists that reasonably would be expected to result in,
any Liability to the Company with respect to any Employee Plan, including any
Liability, Tax, penalty or fee under any applicable Legal Requirements (other
than to pay premiums, contributions or benefits in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice) or third-party Contracts, including
Contracts with Administaff.

(i) Except as required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any Employee
Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, no condition or
circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Employee Plan and neither the Company nor any such Employee Plan will be
subject to any surrender fees or service fees on termination except for
reasonable administrative fees associated with the termination of such
Employee Plan. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
or condition or circumstance exists that would result in a material increase
in the benefits under or the expenses of maintaining any Employee Plan from
the level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no event or circumstance has occurred or
exists, or is likely to exist that would result in the imposition of a lien or
excise tax with respect to any Employee Plan.

(j) Any Employee Plan that constitutes a "non-qualified deferred compensation
plan" subject to Code Section 409A fully complies with Code Section 409A with
respect to its form and is and has been operated in compliance with Code
Section 409A.



 

31 (k) The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Administaff have not
made any written or verbal commitments to any officer, Employee, consultant
or independent contractor of the Company with respect to compensation,
promotion, retention, termination, severance or similar matter in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will result (either alone or in combination with any other
event) in (i) any Liability to the Company or Parent or any payment of, or
increase in, remuneration or benefits, to any Employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company, (ii) any cancellation of indebtedness owed to the
Company by any Employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company, (iii)
the acceleration of the vesting, funding or time of any payment or benefit to
any Employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company (including the
applicable Company Stock Option Plan under which any Company Options were
granted if the vesting of such Company Options will accelerate in connection
with the Merger) or (iv) any "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be
reasonable compensation for services rendered). The Company can terminate its
relationship with Administaff on 30 days notice without liability, other than
routine payment for earned but unpaid fees and costs incurred prior to the
date of such termination.

(l) The Company does not have any unfunded Liability under any Employee Plan.

(m) The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Administaff have not
announced or entered into any plan or binding commitment to (i) create or
cause to exist any additional Employee Plan or (ii) adopt, amend or terminate
any Employee Plan, other than any amendment required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(n) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (i)
complaint, claim, charge, suit, proceeding or other action of any kind with
respect to any Employee Plan (other than a routine claim for benefits in
accordance with such Employee Plans claims procedures and that have not
resulted in any litigation) or the fiduciaries or administrators of any
Employee Plan or (ii) proceeding, examination, audit, inquiry, investigation,
citation, or other action of any kind in or before any Governmental Body with
respect to any Employee Plan or any Employee Plan fiduciary or administrator
and there exists no state of facts that after notice or lapse of time or both
reasonably would be expected to give rise to any such claim, investigation,
examination, audit or other proceeding.

(o) As of the Effective Time, each of the Benefit Plans shall have been
terminated (or, to the extent a Benefit Plan is sponsored or administered by
Administaff, the Companys participation in such Benefit Plan shall have been
terminated), and after the Effective Time no Employee (or any of their spouses
or beneficiaries) shall have any right under the Benefit Plans and
all Liabilities of the Company under or with respect to the Benefit Plans
(including any Liabilities relating to services performed prior to the
Closing) shall be fully extinguished at no cost, and with no Liability, to the
Company.

(p) All current Employees are employed pursuant to a co-employer relationship
between the Company and Administaff. Part 2.17(p) of the Company Disclosure 



 

32  Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of: (i) the names,
citizenship status (whether such Employee is an United States citizen or
otherwise) and, with respect to non-United States citizens, identifies the
visa or other similar permit under which such Employee is working for the
Company and the dates of issuance and expiration of such visa or other similar
permit, titles, annual base salary, commission, and any other cash
compensation or bonus opportunity of all Employees as of the date of this
Agreement, including their principal location; and (ii) the wage rates for
non-salaried Employees as of the date of this Agreement (by classification).
The employment relationship of each such Employee with the Company is
terminable at the will of the Company without notice or Liability (other than
for accrued, but unpaid wages) or approval from any third party, such as
Administaff.

(q) Part 2.17(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies each
former Employee who is receiving or is scheduled to receive (or whose spouse
or other dependent is receiving or is scheduled to receive) any benefits
(whether from the Company or otherwise) relating to such former Employees
employment with the Company or with Administaff in its capacity as a co-
employer with the Company; and Part 2.17(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
accurately describes such benefits.

(r) The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Administaff (with
respect to Employees co-employed by Administaff) have complied in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements relating to employment,
employment practices, wages, hours, immigration control, employee safety,
bonuses and terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to,
laws relating to job applicants and laws relating to employee background
checks. No Legal Proceeding that arises out of the current, former or
potential employment relationship between the Company or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, Administaff (in its capacity as a co-employer of Employees) and
any of the Companys current, former or potential employees has been filed or
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or Administaff. The Company has not engaged in layoffs, terminations or
relocations sufficient in number to trigger application of the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any
similar state, local or foreign law or regulation requiring advance notice of
a mass layoff or plant closing or other similar event requiring advance notice
to any Employee, Employee representative or Governmental Body (collectively,
the " _WARN Act_ "). The Company and Administaff have not caused any of the
Companys employees to suffer an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN
Act) or similar event during the 180 days preceding the date of this
Agreement that, when aggregated with enough similar other events, would result
in any obligation on behalf of the Company or Parent under the WARN Act.

(s) The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Administaff have
maintained and currently maintain adequate insurance as required by
applicable Legal Requirements with respect to workers compensation claims and
unemployment benefits claims by Employees. The Company is not liable for any
payment to, or with respect to, any trust or other fund governed by
or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, workers compensation, social security or
other benefits or obligations for their employees (other than routine payments
to be made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice).



 

33 (t) The Company is not a party to or bound by, and the Company has never been
a party to or been bound by, any union contract, collective bargaining
agreement or similar Contract with any labor union or labor organization.
Administaff is not a party to or bound by and has never been a party to or
bound by any union contract, collective bargaining agreement or similar
contract with any labor union or labor organization with respect to the
Employees who are co-employed by Administaff. No representation election
petition or application for certification has been filed by Employees or is
pending with the National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental Body
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no union organizing campaign or other
attempt to organize or establish a labor union, employee organization or
labor organization or group or other similar activity or dispute involving
Employees has occurred, is in progress or is threatened. In the last five
years, there has not been any slowdown, work stoppage, labor dispute or union
organizing activity, or any similar material labor activity or dispute,
affecting the Company or any Employees and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred and no circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to
directly or indirectly give rise to or provide a basis for the commencement
of any slowdown, work stoppage, labor dispute or union organization activity
or any similar material labor activity or dispute. Administaff (with respect
to the Employees) and the Company have never engaged in any unfair labor
practice and there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened labor board proceeding of any kind. The Company reasonably believes
that it has good labor relations and the Company has no reason to believe that
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have
a material adverse effect on the Companys labor relations.

(u) The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of
all current employee manuals and handbooks, disclosure materials, policy
statements and other material documents provided by the Company or

with the Company;

(ii) no current Employee has received an offer to join a business that may be
competitive with the Companys business; and

Employee of any of his or her duties or responsibilities as an Employee or
(B) the Companys business or operations.

(w) As of the Effective Time, any bonus that has been earned by any Employee
pursuant to any bonus arrangement, and any Taxes related thereto, shall have
been paid without Liability or obligation to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time.



 

34 (x) No Employee has notified the Company of any: (i) obligations
of confidentiality of such Employee to any other Person(s) that conflict or
might conflict with such Employees work for, or such Employees obligations
to, the Company; (ii) Proprietary Rights of any other Person(s) that conflict
or might conflict with such Employees work for, or such Employees
obligations to, the Company; or (iii) claims of such Employee to any
Proprietary Rights that conflict or might conflict with such Employees work
for, or such Employees obligations to, the Company.

reserves the right, without the Companys prior consent, to make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable securities
laws or securities listing standards (in which case Parent agrees to use
reasonable efforts to advise the Company prior to making such disclosure).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, following the Closing, the
Shareholders Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it
has been engaged to serve as the Shareholders Representative in connection
with the Merger, as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the
other terms of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein;

opportunity to comment prior to such announcement.

Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated by reference in this
Agreement and which terms will survive until the Closing, at which time
the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate; _provided, however_ , that if
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the

materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) provided to
such party or such person related to the tax treatment and tax structure,

securities laws, provide, however, that such disclosure may not be made until
the earlier of (i) public announcement of discussions relating to the Merger,
(ii) public announcement of the Merger, or (iii) execution of an agreement to
enter into the Merger. This authorization is not intended to permit disclosure
of any information regarding (without limitation) (A) any portion of any
materials to the extent not related to the Mergers tax treatment or tax
structure, (B) the identities of potential participants, (C) the existence or
status of any negotiations, (D) any pricing or financial information (except
to the extent such pricing or financial information is related to the Mergers
tax treatment or tax structure) or (E) any other term or detail not relevant
to the Mergers tax treatment or tax structure.

5.4 Registration Statement. Except as may be necessary to avoid violation of
any applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business
Days, to the extent not already registered, file a registration statement

shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to awards of Restricted Stock
Units contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 5.5(a) (the " _RSUs_ ")

aggregate amount equal to $20,000,000 less the value of the aggregate
"spread" of the Substituted Options (such amount, the " _RSU Pool_ "). The
number of RSUs to be awarded shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the RSU Pool by the Parent Stock Price. Prior to the date hereof,
Parent has delivered to the Company a tentative schedule of such RSU grants.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the preparation of a final schedule of RSU
grants which shall include the name of the recipient and the number of RSUs
to be awarded to such recipient immediately after the Closing. The RSUs will
either vest annually over a four-year period starting on the Closing Date or,
for performance-based RSUs, vest over a two-year period if specified

Corporation Employees_ ") participation in employee benefit programs on terms
that are reasonably similar to those offered to Parents similarly-situated
employees, as determined by Parent. Parent shall treat, cause the Surviving
Corporation to treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the
service of Company Employees with the Company attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or the Surviving

thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the
requisite shareholder approval procedure under Section 5.7, and who might
otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code as a result of (a) the

Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the requisite
shareholder approval of such accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options
and stock is obtained pursuant to Section 5.7.

5.7 Section 280G Shareholder Approval. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the approval by such number of Company
Shareholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) so as to
render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code
inapplicable to any and all accelerated vesting payments, benefits, options

connection herewith (including the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 2 and the representations set forth in the Company Compliance

Time on [ *** ]; _provided, however_ , that (i) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in [ *** ] (the "

performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect
the right to indemnification or payment of Damages pursuant to this Article 9,
or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall, for purposes of

suffered or incurred by any Indemnitee or to which any Indemnitee may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of or in connection
with:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company Compliance Certificate or any other document, certificate, schedule or
instrument executed and delivered in connection herewith (in each case,
without giving effect to any "Knowledge" qualification contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in Section 2.17, but only as such
qualifications relate to actions or inactions by Administaff);

(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in this

the Company Securities held by such Effective Time Holder as set forth in the

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise
becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving
Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages
as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach but in either
case the total amount both Parent and the Surviving Corporation may recover
shall not exceed the amount of actual Damages.

9.5 No Contribution. The Company Shareholders shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other Liability to which such shareholders may become subject to or in
connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

9.6 Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim
or Legal Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Corporation, against
Parent or against any other Person) with respect to which any of the
Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification or any other remedy pursuant to
this Article 9, Parent shall promptly give the Shareholders Representative
and the Escrow Agent written notice of such claim or Legal Proceeding (a "
_Claim_ "); _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so
notify the Shareholders Representative shall not limit any of the
Indemnitees rights to indemnification under this Article 9 (except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal
Proceeding).

(b) Within 30 days of delivery of such written notice, the Shareholders
Representative may elect (by written notice delivered to Parent) to take all
necessary steps to properly contest any Claim involving third parties or to
prosecute such Claim to conclusion or, subject to Section 9.6(d), settlement.
If the Shareholders Representative makes the foregoing election, an
Indemnitee will have the right to reasonably participate at its own expense in
all proceedings. If the Shareholders Representative does not make such
election within such period or fails to diligently contest such Claim after
such election, then the Indemnitee shall be free to handle the prosecution or
defense of any such Claim, and will take all necessary steps to contest the
Claim involving third parties or to prosecute such Claim to conclusion or,
subject to Section 9.6(d), settlement, and will notify the Shareholders
Representative of the progress of any such Claim, will permit the
Shareholders Representative, at the sole cost of the Shareholders
Representative, to reasonably participate in all proceedings and will provide
the Shareholders Representative with reasonable access to all relevant
information and documentation relating to the Claim and the prosecution or
defense thereof. In 



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 58 |  | *Confidential Treatment Requested  any case, the party not in control of the Claim will reasonably cooperate
with the other party in the conduct of the prosecution or defense of such
Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 9.6(d), if a Claim
includes Damages equal to an amount in excess of the value of the Escrow Fund
on the date of the Claim, or relates to any Taxes, Proprietary Rights or other
intellectual property issues, or involves any action by any Governmental Body,
Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of
such Claim on its own.

(d) Neither party will compromise or settle any such Claim without the
written consent of either Parent (if the Shareholders Representative defends
the Claim) or the Shareholders Representative (if Parent or other Indemnitees
defend the Claim). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent may withhold its consent to any settlement that does not include a
full general release of all the claims against the Indemnitees from all
parties to the litigation or that requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to
perform any covenant or refrain from engaging in any activity; provided that
such consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(e) If the Shareholders Representative does not elect to contest any Claim
or Legal Proceeding pursuant to Section 9.6(b), and Parent proceeds with the
defense of any such Claim, all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of
such Claim shall be satisfied out of the Escrow Fund in the manner set forth
in the Escrow Agreement.

9.7 Exercise of Remedies; Tax Treatment.

(a) No Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise
any other remedy under this Agreement or under the Escrow Agreement unless
Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to
the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other
remedy.

(b) The parties shall report any indemnification payment made pursuant to
this Article 9 as a purchase price adjustment unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

62 10.5 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

10.6 Headings. The underlined headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one agreement.

10.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the
State of California (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of
laws). The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the Central District of California (or,
if subject matter jurisdiction in that court is not available, in the state
courts of California located in the County of Los Angeles) over any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or entered into in
connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such
courts (and the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH
PARTYS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THEREWITH OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

10.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns (if
any). Prior to the Effective Time, neither party shall assign this Agreement
or any rights or obligations hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) to
any Person without the consent of the other party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

10.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The rights and remedies of
the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. The parties accordingly agree that,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in 



 

63  equity, the parties are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and otherwise to enforce specifically the provisions of this
Agreement. Each party expressly waives any requirement that any other party
obtain any bond or provide any indemnity in connection with any action seeking
injunctive relief or specific enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

10.11 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege
or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,
right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.

10.12 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

10.13 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, shall
be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is
determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be
impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

10.14 Parties in Interest. None of the provisions of this Agreement is
intended to provide any rights or remedies to any Person other than the
parties hereto, the Indemnitees and their respective successors and assigns
(if any). No Employees or others may rely on this Agreement as the basis for
any breach of contract claim against Parent, the Company or any related
Entity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to require
Parent, the Company or any related Entity to employ any particular employee
for any period of time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or
construed to limit Parents, the Companys or any related Entitys right to
terminate the employment of any employee, and nothing in this Agreement shall
modify or amend any Employee Plan or other agreement, plan, program or
document unless this agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends"
such Employee Plan or other agreement, plan, program or document.

10.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Escrow Agreement set forth the
entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among
or between any of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

10.16 Construction; Interpretation. Any reference in this Agreement to an
"Article," "Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding
Article, Section, 



 

64  Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the context indicates
otherwise. The table of contents and the headings of Articles and Sections are
provided for convenience only and are not intended to affect the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement should
be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require. The
term "including" means "including, without limitation" and is intended by way
of example and not limitation. Any reference to a statute is deemed also to
refer to any amendments or successor legislation, and all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as in effect at the relevant time. Any
reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the
Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to
time through such date. The language used in this Agreement is the language
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party
or its attorney drafted the provision.

10.17 Waiver of Conflict of Interest. Parent and Merger Sub understand that
the Company has been represented by Morrison and Foerster LLP as counsel to the
Company, including in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and that Morrison and Foerster LLP has not represented any
director or employee of the Company or any Company Securityholder in the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company acknowledge and agree that Morrison and Foerster LLP may after the
Closing represent one or more of the Shareholders Representative, the
Effective Time Holders and/or their Affiliates in matters related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
including the representation of such Persons or their Affiliates in matters
related to post-Closing claims made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
any other Indemnitees under the indemnification provisions in Article 9 and
other claims that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement. Parent and the
Company hereby acknowledge, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, that
they have had an opportunity to ask for and have obtained information
relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the reasonably
foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and they hereby waive
any conflict arising out of such future representation with respect to the
matters contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
