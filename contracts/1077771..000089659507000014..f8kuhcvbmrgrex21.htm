   to effect the Holding Company Merger and the Secretary of State of the State
of California as required under California law.

Merger. UmpquaÂ’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws shall be the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation.

 

  2.1.3 As of the Effective Time, each share of Umpqua capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger shall remain
outstanding and shall be deemed to be one share of the capital stock of the
surviving corporation.

 

  2.1.4 All shares of NBB Common Stock that are "dissenting shares"
within the meaning of CGCL Â§ 1300 ("DissentersÂ’ Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Umpqua Common Stock or Umpqua
Common Stock and Cash Consideration unless and until such shares have lost
their status as dissenting shares under CGCL Â§ 1300, at which time such
shares shall be converted into Umpqua Common Stock or Umpqua Common Stock and
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1.5.

 

  2.1.5 As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NBB Common
Stock (other than DissentersÂ’ Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive: (i) the number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio, (ii) cash in lieu of any resulting fractional shares, (iii)

each outstanding option to acquire NBB Common Stock (each an "NBB Option")

Exchange Ratio. Provided, further, if Umpqua elects the Cash Fill Option, the
exercise price per share of the NBB options as calculated pursuant to this
Section 2.1.6(a) will be reduced by the amount of the Cash Consideration. All
terms and conditions of the Converted Options other than the number of shares
and exercise price as adjusted pursuant to the Section 2.1.6(a) shall remain
the same as the terms and conditions of the NBB Options. With respect to each
NBB Option, the foregoing adjustments shall be effected in a manner consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Code and related treasury regulations.

 

  (b) Umpqua shall, as of the Effective Time, assume the obligations and
rights of NBB under the NBB Stock Plans pursuant to which NBB Options and NBB

maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration

long as the Converted Options remain outstanding.

agent reasonably acceptable to NBB for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing shares of NBB Common Stock (other than DissentersÂ’ Shares) for
Umpqua Common Stock and, as applicable, Cash Consideration as required by
Section 2.1 (the "Exchange Agent"). On or about the Effective Date, Umpqua
will issue and deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates representing a
sufficient number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock issuable in the Holding
Company Merger and an estimate of the cash required to make cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares and, after the Effective Time, if applicable, any
Cash Consideration and any cash and dividends or other distributions of Umpqua
Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.3.3.

 

 2.3.2 Promptly after the Effective Time, Umpqua shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares (other than holders of DissentersÂ’ Shares) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Holding Company Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates for shares of NBB Common Stock ("Old Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 2.3.5) and instructions for surrendering the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of one or more Old Certificates, accompanied by a duly executed letter of transmittal in proper form, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to each holder of such surrendered Old Certificates new certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock ("New Certificates"), together with checks for payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be issued in respect 

   of the Old Certificates plus any Cash Consideration and any dividends
(including the $0.14 cash dividend permitted pursuant to Section 6.1(b) if the
Effective Time is on or before March 31, 2007 and such dividend is declared
but unpaid at such time) or other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2, less any taxes
required to be withheld with respect thereto.

 

  2.3.3 Until Old Certificates have been surrendered and exchanged for
New Certificates as herein provided, each outstanding Old Certificate shall
be deemed, for all corporate purposes of Umpqua, to represent the number of
shares of Umpqua Common Stock into which the shares of NBB Common Stock were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1.5. All shares of Umpqua Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Holding Company Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Umpqua in respect of the Umpqua Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions that
are declared on Umpqua Common Stock into which shares of NBB Common
Stock have been converted after the Effective Date will be paid to persons
otherwise entitled to receive the same until the Old Certificates have been
surrendered in exchange for New Certificates in the manner herein provided. In
no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends or other
distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other
distributions. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of NBB Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of NBB, a New
Certificate, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender
of the Old Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in respect
thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Old Certificate formerly representing such shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required by Umpqua and the
Exchange Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

  2.3.4 Any Umpqua Common Stock or cash delivered to the Exchange Agent
(together with any interest or dividends thereon) and not issued pursuant to
this Section 2.3 at the end of twelve months from the Effective Date shall be
returned to Umpqua, in which event the persons entitled thereto shall look
only to Umpqua for payment thereof.

 

  2.3.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if any holder of NBB Common Stock shall be unable to surrender his
or her Old Certificates because such certificates have been lost or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof a lost stock certificate
affidavit and, unless waived, at the sole option of Umpqua or the Exchange
Agent, an indemnity bond in customary amount together with a surety, each in
a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Umpqua or the Exchange Agent.

 

  2.3.6 The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Umpqua Common Stock or
NBB Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with
respect to such shares of Umpqua Common Stock for the account of the persons
entitled thereto.

 

  2.4 _Dissenters Â’ Shares_. Any Dissenting Shareholder who shall be
entitled to be paid the fair market value of such shareholderÂ’s shares of NBB
Common Stock, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL, shall not be entitled
to shares of Umpqua Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio or, as applicable,
shares of Umpqua Common Stock and Cash Consideration in respect thereof
unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting ShareholderÂ’s right
to dissent from the Holding Company Merger under the CGCL, and shall 

  be entitled to receive only the payment provided for by Section 1300 of the
CGCL with respect to such DissentersÂ’ Shares.

 

 2.5 _Anti-Dilution Provision_. If Umpqua changes or proposes to change the number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Umpqua Common Stock, or exchanges Umpqua Common Stock for a different number or kind of shares or securities or is involved in any transaction resulting in any of the foregoing, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

 4. Representations and Warranties of NBB and TVB. 
--- 
  
  
  
 

 Except as disclosed in one or more schedules to this Agreement delivered to Umpqua prior to execution of this Agreement (the "NBB Disclosure Schedule"), NBB and TVB represent and warrant to Umpqua as follows: 

 

 4.1 _Organization, Existence, and Authority_. NBB is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of California and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business in the manner now being conducted. TVB is a state-chartered bank, duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of California and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and assets and carry on its business in the manner now being conducted. Each of NBB and TVB is qualified to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which such qualification is required except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NBB. North Bay Bancorp Statutory Trust I is a statutory trust organized and validly existing under Connecticut law and the trustÂ’s activities do not require it to be qualified to do business in any jurisdiction other than Connecticut. VCT was a subsidiary of TVB and a statutory real estate investment trust organized under Maryland law and qualified to do business in California. VCT has been dissolved, all preferred shares of beneficial interest have been liquidated and all remaining assets of VCT have been distributed to TVB as the sole holder of common shares of beneficial interest.

 

 4.2 _Authorized and Outstanding Stock, Options, and Other Rights_. The authorized capital stock of NBB consists of (i) 500,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, of which no preferred shares are issued or outstanding, and (ii) 15,000,000 shares of common stock, without par value, of which 4,169,845 shares are outstanding as of the close of business on January 17, 2007, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All outstanding shares of capital stock of TVB are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and held by NBB. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which NBB shareholders may vote are issued or outstanding. Other than 474,125.73 shares of NBB Common Stock issuable upon exercise of NBB Options under NBB Stock Plans as of the close of business on January 17, 2007, and 23,650 shares of NBB Common Stock issued pursuant to NBB Stock Awards as of the close of business on January 17, 2007, and as disclosed in the NBB Public Reports and in Section 4.2 of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, no subscriptions, options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights or commitments which would enable the holder to acquire any shares of capital stock or other investment securities of NBB or TVB, or which enable or require NBB or TVB to acquire shares of its capital stock or of investments issued by NBB or TVB from any holder, are authorized, issued or outstanding. All grants of NBB Options were properly approved by NBBÂ’s Board of Directors or a committee duly authorized by the Board of Directors and validly issued in accordance with the applicable NBB Stock Plan and applicable law. No grant of an NBB Option involved any "backdating."

 (f) NBB and the NBB Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate actions are taken with respect to any differences. NBB has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and has identified for its auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal controls. NBB has implemented "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by NBB in the NBB Public Reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to NBBÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

    (g) Each NBB Public Report that was required to be accompanied by the
certifications contemplated by Item 601 of Regulation S-K was so accompanied,
and at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such
certification complied with such item and was accurate in all material
respects as of the date of such certificate.

 

  (h) The audit committee of the NBB Board of Directors has established
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding
the accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters and the

questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing NBB or
any NBB Subsidiary, whether or not employed by NBB or any NBB Subsidiary, has
reported "evidence of a material violation" (within the meaning of Part 205 of
the Standards of Professional Conduct for Attorneys Appearing and Practicing
Before the Commission in the Representation of an Issuer) by NBB or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the NBB Board of Directors or
any committee thereof, to NBBÂ’s chief executive officer. Section 4.3 of the
NBB Disclosure Schedule lists all investigations conducted prior to the date
hereof regarding any reported "evidence of a material violation" by NBB or
any of its officers, directors, employees or agents and all NBB audit
committee investigations conducted prior to the date hereof of complaints by
NBB employees regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing
matters.

 

  (i) NBB is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market, and

and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Holding Company Plan of Merger or Bank Plan of Merger by NBB and TVB,
as the case may be, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby will conflict with, result in any material breach or violation of, or
result in any default or any acceleration of performance under, or will result
in the declaration or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any
of the assets of NBB or TVB under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of (a) NBBÂ’s or TVBÂ’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, (b) any statute,
regulation or existing order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental agency, or (c) any contract, agreement or instrument to which any

threatened (in writing) audit or investigation of NBB or TVB with respect to
any Tax liabilities. There are currently no agreements in effect with respect
to NBB or TVB to extend the period of limitations for assessment or collection
of any Tax, and, except as required by law  among NBB and the NBB
Subsidiaries, neither NBB or TVB is a party to any tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement or is liable for any Tax imposed on
any other Person other than NBB or TVB. Except as disclosed in Section 4.17 of
the NBB Disclosure Schedule, all Taxes that NBB or TVB is required to
withhold from amounts owing to any employee or director, former employee or
director, creditor or third party have been properly withheld and, to the
extent payable, timely paid. NBB has delivered to Umpqua true and correct
copies of NBBÂ’s and TVBÂ’s unconsolidated or uncombined federal and state
income or franchise tax returns for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. "Tax" or
"Taxes" means (i) any and all federal, 
 

   state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross income, ad
valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, payroll,
employment, severance, withholding, duties, intangibles, franchise, backup
withholding, and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments together
with all penalties and additions to tax and interest thereon and (ii) any
liability for any items described in clause (i), as successor or transferee,
by contract or otherwise. NBB, TVB or VCT paid Tax on all income received by
VCT as though VCT was not qualified as a "real estate investment trust" under
Code Section 856.

 

  4.18 _Real Property, Leased Personal Property_. Section 4.18 of the NBB
Disclosure Schedule includes a list of all the real property owned or leased
by NBB or TVB and all real property held by NBB or TVB as of the date hereof
as other real estate owned (the "NBB Real Property"). Except for disposition
of other real estate owned in the ordinary course of business and except as
disclosed in Section 4.18 of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, NBB or TVB will own
or have a valid leasehold interest in all of the NBB Real Property on the
Effective Date. All NBB Real Property reflected in the NBB Public Reports or
TVBÂ’s Call Reports as of September 30, 2006 is included in Section 4.18 of the
NBB Disclosure Schedule. The leases pursuant to which NBB or TVB leases real
property and material personal property, true and correct copies of
which have been delivered to Umpqua, are the legal, valid and binding
obligation of NBB or TVB, enforceable against such entity in accordance with
its terms, and, to the Knowledge of NBB, are the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the other party thereto, enforceable against such entity in
accordance with its terms, in each case subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights and to general
equity principles valid, and neither NBB nor TVB nor, to the Knowledge of NBB,
the other party thereto is in material default, and no event has occurred that
would, with the giving of notice, lapse of time or both, constitute
a material default under such leases. No material waiver or indulgence has
been granted by any landlord under any such leases. All owned NBB Real
Property and material personal property owned by NBB or TVB is free of any
adverse claims, except for (1) statutory liens not yet delinquent which are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and liens for taxes
not yet due, for which NBB maintains reserves as required by GAAP consistently
applied with the NBB Public Reports, (2) pledges of assets in the ordinary
course of business to secure public deposits, (3) defects and irregularities
of title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for
the purposes for which they are held, (4) mechanicsÂ’, materialmenÂ’s,
workmenÂ’s, repairmenÂ’s, warehousemenÂ’s, carriersÂ’ and other similar liens, for
sums not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business for which
NBB maintains reserves as required by GAAP consistently applied with the NBB
Public Reports and (5) adverse claims with respect to properties and assets
the loss of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NBB
("Permitted Liens"). All buildings and structures on the NBB Real Property,
the equipment located thereon, and the real and personal property leased by
NBB or TVB, are in good operating condition and in a good state of repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted). The NBB Real Property is in material
compliance with all applicable zoning laws and building codes. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of NBB, threatened condemnation proceedings
against the NBB Real Property. To NBBÂ’s Knowledge, since January 1, 2005,
neither NBB nor TVB have received any written notices alleging violations of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations, California Building Standard Code and all
similarly motivated state and local laws ("Local Barriers Acts") or the
Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), any notices of claims
made or threatened in writing regarding noncompliance with ADA, or Local
Barriers Acts or any written notices of any governmental or regulatory actions
or investigations instituted or threatened regarding noncompliance with ADA
or Local Barriers Acts. NBB and TVB have good and marketable title to all of
their owned NBB Real Property and personal property, subject to no mortgages,
pledges, encumbrances, liens or charges of any kind, except for Permitted
Liens.

 

  4.19 _Insurance_. For each of the past three years and continuing
through the date hereof, NBB and TVB have insured their business and real and
personal property against all risks of a character usually

  insured against, including but not limited to financial institution bond,
directors and officers liability, property and casualty and commercial
liability insurance, with customary amounts of coverage, deductibles and
exclusions by reputable insurers authorized to transact insurance in the State
of California and such other jurisdictions where they do business or own
property. NBB and TVB are in material compliance with all existing insurance
policies and have not failed to give timely notice of, or present properly,
any material claim thereunder of which NBB has Knowledge. Section 4.19 of the
NBB Disclosure Schedule includes a list of all insurance policies in force as
of the date hereof with respect to NBBÂ’s and TVBÂ’s business and real and
personal property. No insurer has advised NBB or any NBB Subsidiary that it
intends to materially reduce coverage or materially increase any premium under
any such policy or that coverage is not available (or that it will contest
coverage) for any material claim made against NBB or any NBB Subsidiary.

 

 4.20 _Intellectual Property_. NBB and TVB own or have valid licenses to use all Intellectual Property which they consider to be material to their business taken as a whole, and have not received written notice of infringement or violation of any Intellectual Property which would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NBB. 

 

 4.21 _Contracts and Agreements_. Section 4.21 of the NBB Disclosure Schedule is a list of each Contract (i) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of SEC Regulation S-K); (ii) to which NBB or TVB is a party or to which any of their properties are subject that individually or together with all related Contracts involve a payment after the date of this Agreement by NBB or TVB in excess of $50,000; (iii) would prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the Holding Company Merger or the Bank Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) would entitle any present or former director, officer employee or agent of NBB or any NBB Subsidiary to indemnification from NBB or any NBB Subsidiary; (v) limits the ability of the NBB or any NBB Subsidiary from competing in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any person, or which requires referrals of business or requires NBB or any NBB Subsidiary to offer products or services of any other person on a priority or exclusive basis; (vi) gives rise to any benefits to any other person as a result of the consummation of the Holding Company Merger or the Bank Merger; or (vii) is with current officers and directors and any persons who have been an officer or director of NBB or TVB within the past three years, other than Contracts relating to deposits or Loans that are fully performing in accordance with their terms, and the terms of which are no more favorable than those available to unaffiliated parties made at or about the same time (collectively, "Material Contracts").

 

 Each Material Contract is valid and binding on NBB or the NBB Subsidiary (as the case may be) that is a party thereto, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights and to general equity principles. and neither NBB nor TVB is in material default or breach, and there has not occurred any event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute a material breach or default by any such entity, under any Material Contract, and to the Knowledge of NBB, except with respect to loan agreements or notices with TVB customers reflected in TVBÂ’s delinquent loan reports, no other party thereto is in material default thereof. Except as disclosed in Section 4.21 of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, no consent or approval by the other parties to any Material Contract is required by reason of this Agreement to maintain such oral or written contracts, agreements or leases in effect.

 

4.22 _Employee Benefits._ 
  
  (a) Each Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by NBB, or any
entity which is considered one employer with NBB as determined under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate"), is disclosed in
Section 4.22(a) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule. Neither NBB nor any ERISA
Affiliate maintains nor sponsors any other pension, profit sharing, thrift,
savings, bonus, retirement, vacation, life insurance, health insurance,
severance, salary continuation, sickness, disability, medical or death benefit
plans, whether or not subject to ERISA. There are no other compensation,

   employment, stock options, stock purchase agreements, life, health, accident
or other insurance, bonus, deferred or incentive compensation, change-in-
control, severance or separation, salary continuation, profit
sharing, retirement, or employee fringe benefit policies or arrangements of
any kind that could result in the payment to any current or former employees,
directors, consultants or any of their beneficiaries of NBB or TVB of any
money or other property.

 

  (b) The only "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA) sponsored or maintained by NBB or any ERISA Affiliate, or to
which NBB or any ERISA Affiliate contributes ("Welfare Benefit Plan") or are
required to contribute, are as set forth Section 4.22(b) of the NBB Disclosure
Schedule.

 

  (c) Except as disclosed in Section 4.22(c) of the NBB Disclosure
Schedule, there are no Contracts, agreements, arrangements, undertakings or
commitments maintained or agreed to by either of NBB or TVB or provision of
any Employee Benefit Plan that provide for or could result in the payment to
any NBB or TVB employee or director or former employee or director of any
money or other property rights or that would accelerate the vesting
or payment of such amounts or rights to any such person as a result of the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set
forth in Section 4.22(c) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, no such payment or
acceleration set forth in Section 4.22(c) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule
could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Code Section 280G.

 

  (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.22(d) of the NBB Disclosure
Schedule, neither NBB nor any ERISA Affiliate has maintained a single-employer
pension benefit plan that is subject to title 1, subtitle B, part 3 of ERISA
within six years of the date hereof (each, a "Pension Benefit Plan"). With
respect to any such Pension Benefit Plan, the amount of liability for any
contribution paid or owing with respect to such Pension Benefit Plan for the
last or current plan year and the plan year in which the Effective Date occurs
is set forth on Section 4.22(d) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in Section 4.22(d) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, under each Pension
Benefit Plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to
the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
Pension Benefit Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the
then current value of the assets of such Pension Benefit Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a
result of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Benefit Plan since
the last day of the most recent plan year.

 

  (e) NBB and, to the Knowledge of NBB, all persons having fiduciary or
other responsibilities or duties with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan,
are, and have since inception been, in substantial compliance in all material
respects with, and each such Employee Benefit Plan is and has been operated
substantially in accordance with its provisions and in compliance with the
applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such Employee Benefit Plan,
including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by the
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Internal
Revenue Service under ERISA or the Code. Each Pension Benefit Plan and any
related trust agreements or annuity contracts (or any other funding
instruments) substantially comply both as to form and operation, with the
provisions of ERISA and the Code (including Section 410(b) of the Code
relating to coverage), where required in order to be tax-qualified under
Section 401(a) or 403(a) or other applicable provisions of the Code, and all
other applicable laws, rules and regulations; all material governmental
approvals for the Employee Benefit Plans have been obtained; and a favorable
determination or opinion as to the qualification under the Code of each
Pension Benefit Plan described in Section 4.22(d) of the NBB Disclosure
Schedule has been made or given by the Internal Revenue Service covering
all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or such letter or opinion has been applied for
within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the
Code. No Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer
pension plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. To the
Knowledge of NBB, all

  contributions or other amounts payable by NBB or TVB as of the date hereof
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan
years have been paid or accrued in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and, to the extent applicable, Section 412 of the Code,
and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of NBB, threatened or
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of
or against any Employee Benefit Plan, or any trusts related thereto which
would, individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NBB.

 

 (f) Each Welfare Benefit Plan and each Pension Benefit Plan has been administered to date in material compliance with the requirements of the claims procedure of the Code and ERISA. All reports required by any government agency and disclosures to participants with respect to each Welfare Benefit Plan and each Pension Benefit Plan have been timely made or filed. Each Employee Benefit Plan is in material compliance with the governing instruments and applicable federal or state law. In particular, but without limitation, each Welfare Benefit Plan is in material compliance with federal law, including without limitation the health care continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"). Except as set forth in Section 4.22(f) of the NBB Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees or directors of NBB or any ERISA Affiliate beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, (iii) any deferred compensation benefits fully accrued as liabilities on the books of NBB or any ERISA Affiliate or (iv) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee or director (or beneficiary thereof).

 

 (g) Neither NBB nor, to the Knowledge of NBB, any plan fiduciary of any Welfare Benefit Plan or Pension Benefit Plan, has engaged in any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA (for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or for which no exemption has been granted by the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service) or any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) for which no exemption exists under Section 4975(c)(2) or (d) of the Code or for which no exemption has been granted by the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service, in each case which would, individually, or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NBB. To the Knowledge of NBB, neither NBB nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction in connection with which NBB or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter and (iii) Umpqua shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Umpqua

applicable law.

 

  (c) All rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of an Indemnified Party as
provided in their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws and any
existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section 7.10(c) of the NBB

otherwise provide comparable coverage for such period.

with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets

proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
surviving corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this

benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

11. Termination; Price Protection. 
  
  11.1 _Procedure for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated before
the Effective Date:

 

 (a) By the mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Umpqua and NBB acknowledged in writing; 

 

 (b) By Umpqua or NBB acting through their Boards of Directors upon written notice to the other party, if at the time of such notice the Mergers shall not have become effective by October 1, 2007 (or such later date as shall have been agreed to in writing by Umpqua and NBB acting through their respective Boards of Directors) except to the extent that the failure of the Mergers then to be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of such party, which action or inaction is in violation of its obligations under this Agreement;

  (c) By Umpqua, acting through its Board of Directors upon written notice to NBB, if there has been a breach by NBB in its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein such that Section 8.8 or 8.9 would not be satisfied and which misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured within thirty (30) days notice to NBB of such misrepresentation, breach or failure; or by NBB, acting through its Board of Directors upon written notice to Umpqua, if there has been a breach by Umpqua in its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein such that Section 9.7 or 9.8 would not be satisfied and which misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured within thirty (30) days notice to Umpqua of such misrepresentation, breach or failure; 

 

 (d) By NBB, if its Board of Director determines in good faith (after consultation with Nixon Peabody LLP) that such action is required in order for the directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law; or

 

 (e) By NBB, if (1) the Umpqua Measuring Price is less than $26.42, (2) NBB delivers written notice to Umpqua of its intention to terminate this Agreement within two business days following the close of the Umpqua Measuring Period and (3) Umpqua does not elect to pursue a Decline Adjustment or Cash Fill Option as set forth below; provided, however, that, if Umpqua effects a stock dividend, stock split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction after the date hereof and prior to the date on which the Umpqua Measuring Price is determined, the provisions of this Section 11.1(e) shall be appropriately adjusted so that such event does not in and of itself trigger a termination right on behalf of NBB.

 

      | The following terms have the following meanings: 
---|--- 

      | (i)   |   | "Umpqua Measuring Period" means
the fifteen trading days ending on the fifth business day prior to the
Effective Date. 
---|---|---|--- 
     | 
     | (ii)   |   | "Umpqua Measuring Price" means the mathematical
average of the per share closing prices of Umpqua Common Stock as quoted on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or
another authoritative source) over the Umpqua Measuring Period. 
     | 
 

 Except as provided in Section 11.4, NBB shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) if Umpqua elects, no later than the close of business on the second succeeding Business Day after the later of (i) the close of the Umpqua Measuring Period and (ii) receipt of notice of NBBÂ’s intent to terminate, either to:

 

 (A) adjust the Exchange Ratio (a "Decline Adjustment") such that the Exchange Ratio (carried to five significant digits) shall equal the quotient of (i) $32.15 divided by (ii) the Umpqua Measuring Price, or 

 

 (B) maintain the Exchange Ratio at 1.217 and pay additional consideration to NBB Shareholders (the "Cash Fill Option") in cash ("Cash Consideration") per share equal to $32.15 minus the product of (i) 1.217 times (ii) the Umpqua Measuring Price.

 

Upon UmpquaÂ’s election of the Decline Adjustment or the Cash Fill Option, no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
term Exchange Ratio, as applicable, shall have been so modified), and in the
event of a Decline Adjustment any references in this Agreement to "Exchange
Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio, as
applicable, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) .

 

 (f) By NBB or Umpqua, acting through its Board of Directors, if any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of any of the Mergers shall 

  become final and non-appealable (whether before or after the approval by the
shareholders of NBB or Umpqua).

 

 (g) By either party if NBB shareholders fail to approve the principal terms of this Agreement at a meeting held pursuant to Section 6.10 or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

 

 11.2 _Effect of Termination._ 

 

 11.2.1 In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), 11.1(e) or 11.1(f), this Agreement shall become wholly void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the part of any party or its respective Board of Directors as a result of such termination or abandonment.

 

 11.2.2 If this Agreement is terminated by NBB or Umpqua pursuant to Section 11.1(g) (provided that no failure of any covenant, condition, representation or warranty on the part of Umpqua or within the reasonable control of NBB shall have proximately caused the failure of NBB shareholders to have approved the principal terms of this Agreement), by Umpqua pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or by NBB pursuant to Section 11.1(d), then NBB agrees to pay to Umpqua its reasonable expenses incurred in entering into and attempting to consummate the transaction up to a maximum of $500,000, to be paid within thirty (30) days after UmpquaÂ’s request; provided, however, if Umpqua has terminated the Agreement as a result of NBBÂ’s willful failure to comply with any material covenant set forth in Section 6, it agrees to pay Umpqua an additional $2,000,000, to be paid within thirty (30) days after UmpquaÂ’s request. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(g) or Section 11.1(d), or by Umpqua pursuant to Section 11.1(c) and NBB enters into an Alternative Acquisition Transaction prior to the date that is 12 months from the date of termination and such Alternative Acquisition Transaction had been proposed prior to the date of the NBB shareholder meeting in the case of termination pursuant to Section 11.1(g) or prior to the date of termination in the case of termination pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or 11.1(d); and provided that in any of such events if, at the time of NBBÂ’s shareholder meeting there was no material failure by Umpqua to comply with the covenants set forth in Section 7 and to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 9.7 and 9.9, then NBB will, within thirty (30) days after UmpquaÂ’s request, pay Umpqua the sum of $5,000,000 (reduced by any amounts paid or payable pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph). This Section 11.2.2 shall be the sole remedy in favor of Umpqua for termination of this Agreement pursuant to the sections named in the first sentence, and Umpqua specifically waives the protections of any other legal or equitable remedies that otherwise might be available to Umpqua.

 

 11.2.3 If this Agreement is terminated by NBB pursuant to Section 11.1(c), then Umpqua agrees to pay to NBB its reasonable expenses incurred in entering into and attempting to consummate the transaction up to a maximum of $500,000; provided, however, if NBB has terminated the Agreement as a result of UmpquaÂ’s willful failure to comply with any material covenant set forth in Section 7, it agrees to pay NBB an additional $2,000,000. This Section 11.2.3 shall be the sole remedy in favor of NBB for termination of this Agreement pursuant to the sections named in the first sentence, and NBB specifically waives the protections of any other legal or equitable remedies that otherwise might be available to NBB.

 

 11.3 _Price Protection_. Except as provided in Section 11.4, in the event
the Umpqua Measuring Price is greater than $33.58 the Exchange Ratio (carried
to five significant digits) shall equal the quotient of (i) $40.87 divided by
(ii) the Umpqua Measuring Price. If the Exchange Ratio is adjusted pursuant to
this Section 11.3, this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any
references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to
refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 11.3.

  11.4 _Participation in Subsequent Transaction_. From the date hereof through the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Umpqua shall not enter into any agreement with any unaffiliated third party concerning any purchase or acquisition of Umpqua or Umpqua Bank or substantially all of their respective assets by any unaffiliated third party through any type of corporate reorganization, stock acquisition or exchange, asset purchase or other similar transaction (an "Umpqua Transaction"), unless such Umpqua Transaction expressly provides (i) for the acquisition of NBB by Umpqua or a successor entity on the same terms and conditions as provided for in this Agreement and (ii) that if such Umpqua Transaction is completed before the Effective Time, the shareholders of NBB will be entitled to receive consideration in such transaction as if their shares of NBB had been converted into Umpqua Common Stock at the effective time of such transaction, without giving effect to any adjustment of the Exchange Ratio that would otherwise be required pursuant to Section 11.3 hereof.

 

 11.5 _Documents from NBB_. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Umpqua will promptly deliver to NBB all originals and copies of documents and work papers obtained by Umpqua from NBB, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof.

 

 11.6 _Documents from Umpqua_. In the event of termination of this Agreement, NBB will promptly deliver to Umpqua all originals and copies of documents and work papers obtained by NBB from Umpqua, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof.

Agreement and the Plans of Merger may be amended or modified, either before or
