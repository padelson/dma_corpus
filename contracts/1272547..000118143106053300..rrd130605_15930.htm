Effective Time, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any Option holder, become fully vested. As of the Effective Time,
except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder of Options with respect to
such holder\'s Options, each Option will be canceled and extinguished, and the
holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
excess (if any) of (i) the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to such
Option and (B) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the aggregate exercise price
of such Option, without interest and less any required withholding Taxes as
specified in Section 3.5(c) hereof. All payments with respect to canceled
Options shall be made by the

Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the
Company shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the
direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with
Section 3.5(a). Prior to the Effective Time, as reasonably directed by Parent,
the Company shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this
Section 3.2(a), including, without limitation, adopting any plan amendments
and using reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents; provided,
however, that no action taken by the Company shall be required to be
irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time.

      

(b) As of the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right of the Company
that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the party of the holder, become fully vested. As of
the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right will be canceled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the product of (A) the number of
Shares subject to such stock appreciation right and (B) the Merger
Consideration over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such stock
appreciation right, without interest and less any required withholding Taxes
as specified in Section 3.5(c) hereof. All payments with respect to canceled
stock appreciation rights shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other
agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to
the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation
to pay such amounts in accordance with Section 3.5(a). Prior to the Effective
Time, as reasonably directed by Parent, the Company shall take any and all
actions necessary to effectuate this Section 3.2(b), including, without
limitation, adopting any plan amendments and using reasonable best efforts to
obtain any required consents; provided, however, that no action taken by the
Company shall be required to be irrevocable until immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

      

(c) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a
holder of a Restricted Stock Unit or as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, each Restricted Stock Unit that is issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any Restricted Stock Unit holder, become
fully vested. Each vested Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted into the
right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (but no later than the maximum period permitted
for such payments to qualify under the short-term deferral exception of
Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)), a cash payment with
respect thereto equal to the Merger Consideration less any required
withholding Taxes as specified in Section 3.5(c) hereof. As of the Effective
Time, all Restricted Stock Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each Restricted Stock Unit holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, with respect to the
vested Restricted Stock Units, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
less any required withholding Taxes as specified in Section 3.5(c) hereof,
without interest. Prior to the Effective Time, as reasonably directed by
Parent, the Company shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate
this Section 3.2(c), including, without limitation, providing Restricted Stock
Unit holders with notice of their rights with respect to any such Restricted
Stock Units as provided herein, adopting any plan amendments and using
reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents; provided, however,
that no action taken by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as is
necessary to cause the ending date of the then current offering period under
the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to be at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of such plan (the
"Final Purchase Date"). On the Final Purchase Date, the Company shall apply
the funds credited as of such date under such ESPP within each participant\'s
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares of the Company in
accordance with the terms of such ESPP and shall prevent the commencement of
any new purchase or offering period.

      

Section 3.3 Adjustment of Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration or other dependent item, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this sentence.

               

Section 3.4 Dissenting Shares.

               

(a) Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in favor of or
consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded and perfected their
rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however,
that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall
effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder\'s rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, such stockholder\'s Shares in respect of which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon.

      

(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by
the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters\'
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
exercise of dissenters\' rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights.

               

Section 3.5 Payment and Exchange of Certificates.

               

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as

      

11

      



   



   



   

Paying Agent in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent will, or cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit in trust with, the Paying Agent, the aggregate consideration to which
stockholders, holders of Options, holders of stock appreciation rights of the
Company or holders of Restricted Stock Units become entitled under this
Article III. Until used for that purpose, the funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of
an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Services Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or
banker\'s acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million
(based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise).

      

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a record holder of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares were
converted pursuant to Article III into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the
surrender of stock certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") in order to receive
payment of the Merger Consideration (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only
upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), and shall otherwise be in customary form)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. When the Paying Agent receives a Certificate (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly
completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents,
the Paying Agent shall pay to the holder of the Shares represented by the
Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), or as otherwise
directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to
each Share represented by such Certificate, less any required Tax withholdings
in accordance with Section 3.5(c) below, and the Certificate shall be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of Certificates. If payment is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the Person who surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for
payment of any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that all Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. After the Effective Time, a Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

      

(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Paying Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
a holder of Shares, Options, stock appreciation rights of the Company or
Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Merger or this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be withheld under the Code, or any

      

12

      



   



   



   

applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares (or
Options, stock appreciation rights or Restricted Stock Units) in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

      

(d) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to accept an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed instead
of the Certificate; provided, that the Surviving Corporation may require the
Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid, as a condition precedent to
the payment thereof, to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as
it may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

      

(e) At any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been deposited with the Paying Agent and have not
been disbursed in accordance with this Article III (including, without
limitation, interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect
of the funds made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered to
the Surviving Corporation, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this
Article III shall be entitled to look solely to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them,
without any interest thereon; provided, that such Persons shall have no
greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to
general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under applicable Laws. Any
portion of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed as of
a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent will be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article III
for any consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

      

(f) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not
record on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and treated as
having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented thereby.

                                       

ARTICLE IV

entity in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified, licensed or
in good standing or have such power or authority would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company and
each of its Material Subsidiaries, in each case as currently in full force and
effect, have been made available to Parent and no other organizational
documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company or its Material

affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock voting together as a single
class (the "Requisite Stockholder Vote")).

      

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the unanimous

the date hereof unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of

(collectively, "Takeover Laws") of any jurisdiction that may purport to be
applicable to this Agreement do not apply to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

      

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties

capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries necessary to adopt this Agreement or approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby do and will not (a) violate or
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar governing documents)
of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries, (b) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by clauses (a) -- (f) of
Section 4.4 have been obtained and all filings described in such Section have

violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which its or any of their respective properties are bound, or (c) require the
consent, approval or authorization of, or notice to or filing with any third

obligations under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of, any Material Contract, except, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 4.3, for any such conflict, violation,
breach, default, loss, right or other occurrence which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

      

Section 4.4 Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance of

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.5(a), (i) there are no preemptive rights
of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or
deliver any shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any

Section 4.6 Company Subsidiaries. Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure
Letter lists each Subsidiary of the Company and the jurisdiction of
organization thereof. All the outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary

relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries. Except for its interests in its

      

Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any Equity
Interest in any other Person.

               

Section 4.7 SEC Reports; Financial Information; Cash Balances.

               

(a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
all forms, documents, certifications, registration statements and reports
required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since July 16, 2004 (as
amended to date, the "SEC Reports"). As of their respective dates, or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the SEC Reports complied
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the SEC Reports at the time they
were filed or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not
misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments from the SEC staff with respect to any of the SEC Reports.

      

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related notes
and schedules) of the Company included (or incorporated by reference) in the
SEC Reports fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and
consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to
any other adjustments described therein including the notes thereto, which are
not expected to be significant) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case
of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

      

17

      



   



   



   

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, no fact, event or circumstance currently
exists that would prevent any material amount of the cash, investments or
securities (on a net proceeds basis, and subject to fluctuations in value
based on market and other circumstances prior to conversion to cash) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that were reflected in the line items "Cash and
cash equivalents" or "Short-term investments" or that were debt portfolio
investments reflected in the line item "Investments" on the face of the
Company\'s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in the Company\'s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2006 from being
available as cash for use by the Company in the United States, subject in the
case of the aggregate amount of cash, investments and securities reflected in
the line items "Cash and cash equivalents" or Short-term investments" on such
balance sheet owned or held by non-U.S. Subsidiaries, to restrictions under or
the effect of applicable Laws.

      

Section 4.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto) included in the Company\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six
months ended June 30, 2006, (b) for liabilities or obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business since June 30, 2006, (c) liabilities and
obligations arising under this Agreement, (d) liabilities or obligations which
have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, and
(e) liabilities and obligations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,

and is in compliance with all Licenses from

      

21

      



   



   



   

Governmental Authorities required to conduct their respective businesses as
now being conducted and all such Licenses are valid and in full force and
effect, except for any such License the absence of, the non-compliance with,
or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

incorporated, that together with the Company would be deemed to be a single
employer for purposes of Section 4001 of ERISA or Sections 414(b), (c), (m),
(n) or (o) of the Code. None of the Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.14(c) of

materially increase the cost of such Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

      

(f) Except as provided in this Agreement or as required under applicable Law,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or together
with any other event): (i) result in any material payment (including any

forgiveness of indebtedness or golden parachute payment) becoming due to any
current or former employee under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; (ii)
increase in any material respect any benefit otherwise payable under any
Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; (iii) result in the

employee in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement could
result in a material amount of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning

162(m) of the Code.

      

(g) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has classified any individual as an "independent
contractor" or similar status who, according to a Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan
or applicable Law, should have been classified as an employee or of similar

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability by reason of any
individual who provides or provided services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in any capacity, being improperly excluded from participating in
any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan.

      

(h) Correct and complete copies have been delivered or made available, or will

other fund or to any governmental or administrative authority, with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice).

amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute

      

36

      



   



   



   

and matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, (i) "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

that the Closing is likely to occur within five Business Days, brokerage fees,
breakage fees, losses based on market values or breakage costs, or (B) with
respect to any such items owned or held by non-U.S. Subsidiaries, contravene
any applicable Laws or incur any significant cost or liability or liability

(p) agree to take any of the actions described in Sections 6.1(a) through
6.1(o).

                  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.1 conflict with or impose restrictions that are
inconsistent with the obligations or covenants of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, set forth in Section 4.11 of any Senior Notes
Indenture or Section 7.07 of the Credit Agreement, such restrictions shall be
inoperable and shall not apply; provided, that all such restrictions shall
apply to the maximum extent possible without conflicting with such obligations
or covenants. Prior to taking any taking any action that would be prohibited
by the provisions of this Section 6.1 but for the effect of this paragraph,
the Company will consult with Parent with respect to any such conflicts.

      

Nothing set forth in this Section 6.1 shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

practicable after the SEC indicates that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, and in
accordance with applicable Law, shall (i) duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement (the "Stockholders Meeting") and (ii) subject to Section 6.5(d),
include in the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, if applicable, the Board
Recommendation. Except in accordance with Section 6.5(d), none of the Board of
Directors of the Company, the Special Committee, nor any committee thereof
shall (x) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner

      

40

      



   



   



   

adverse to Parent in any material respect), or publicly propose to withdraw
the Board

      

Recommendation, or (y) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, or (z) knowingly take any other action or knowingly make any other
public statement that is knowingly inconsistent in any material respect with
such Board Recommendation (any action described in this clause (x), (y) or (z)
being referred to as a "Recommendation Withdrawal") (it being understood and
hereby agreed that action taken by the Company, the Board of Directors or the
Special Committee in connection with the notice specified in clause (A) of
Section 6.5(d) will not be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation
Withdrawal). Notwithstanding any Recommendation Withdrawal, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement.

               

Section 6.3 Proxy Statement; Other Filings.

               

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(i) the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, (ii)
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
prepare and file with the SEC and all Other Filings; provided, that the
parties acknowledge that the Company\'s goal is to file the Proxy Statement
within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement and that if it does
not file the Proxy Statement within such period, its senior executives shall
discuss the reasons for the failure to meet such goal with the senior
executives of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC
indicates that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement and the Other
Filings, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The
Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the Other Filings. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or, to the extent applicable, filing the Other Filings (or, in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or
mailing such document shall provide the other party a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by the other party. The
Company shall include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and, to
the extent applicable, the Other Filings, and the Board of Directors shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption of the agreement of merger
(as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) by the stockholders of the
Company, unless the Board of Directors or the Special Committee has effected a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
Section 6.5(d).

      

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should
be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, as
applicable, so that the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings, as applicable,
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Company shall file with the SEC (and, if required by applicable Law or the
SEC, shall disseminate to the stockholders of the Company) an appropriate
amendment thereof or supplement thereto describing such information to the
Company\'s stockholders.

      

41

      



   



   



   

(c) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts, after
consultation with the other party, to resolve all SEC comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings as reasonably promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. Each of the Company and Parent shall as soon as
reasonably practicable notify the other party of the receipt of any comments
from or other correspondence with the SEC staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Other Filings and any request by the SEC for any amendment to
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings or for additional information (and
promptly deliver a copy of such comments, correspondence or request to the
other party).

               

Section 6.4 Access to Information.

               

(a) During the period from the execution of this Agreement through the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Effective
Time, the Company (i) shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of
counsel respecting the provision of privileged communications or any
applicable confidentiality agreement with any Person (provided that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers under such
agreements or implement requisite procedures to enable the provision of
reasonable access without violating such agreement), afford representatives of
Parent and its financing sources reasonable access during normal business
hours to officers, employees, agents, and representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to all properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and will furnish, within a reasonable time, to Parent all information
(including extracts and copies of books, records, contracts and other
documents, including a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws) concerning the operations and
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably
request and (ii) shall, with respect to fiscal months ending after the date of
this Agreement, furnish to Parent promptly, unaudited monthly consolidated
balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries for each fiscal month then
ended and related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows (which
the Company will use reasonable best efforts to furnish within fifteen days
after the end of each fiscal month) as well as an operating plan for each
fiscal month. In conducting any inspection of any properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, Parent and its representatives shall not (i) interfere
with the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conducted at such
property, or (ii) damage any property or any portion thereof.

      

(b) All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall continue to be
governed by the Confidentiality Agreements.

      

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise shall affect
any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

               

Section 6.5 Solicitation.

               

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (EST) on November 3, 2006 (the "No-Shop Period Start Date"), the
Company and its Representatives

      

42

      



   



   



   

may (acting under the direction of the Special Committee) directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of Company
Takeover Proposals (as hereinafter defined) from one or more Persons,
including by way of providing access to non-public information pursuant to the
prior execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with any such
Person; provided, that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any such Person or its Representatives which was not previously
provided to Parent; and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding, and take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making
of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Takeover Proposal.

      

(b) Subject to Sections 6.5(c) and 6.5(d), from the No-Shop Period Start Date
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article VIII, none of the Company, the Company\'s
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives will (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage (it being understood that providing non-public
information in the ordinary course of business will not, in and of itself,
constitute encouragement hereunder) the submission of any inquiries, proposals
or offers or knowingly make any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) enter
into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other agreement providing for
or relating to a Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) enter into any agreement
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing (provided that this clause (v) will not affect the Company\'s
right to negotiate with a Person in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal or
Superior Proposal in compliance with this Section 6.5(b) or Section 6.5(c)).
Subject to Section 6.5(c), on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities that would
otherwise be a violation of this Section 6.5(b) conducted theretofore by the
Company or its Representatives with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
continue discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made a Company
Takeover Proposal on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date or with whom
the Company is having ongoing discussions or negotiations as of the No-Shop
Period Start Date regarding a possible Company Takeover Proposal if in each
case the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith that such
Person could be reasonably expected to make a Company Takeover Proposal that
after further discussions or negotiations could reasonably result in a
Superior Proposal. With respect to parties with whom discussions or
negotiations have been terminated on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to require such
parties to promptly return or destroy in accordance with the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement any confidential information previously
furnished by the Company.

      

(c) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.5(a), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.5(b), if at any time following
the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Vote, (i) the Company receives a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal
from any third party with which the Company

      

43

      



   



   



   

was in contact after the date of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date, or an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal from any other third party and (ii) the Board of Directors (acting
through the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor (it being understood that the
independence of any financial advisor for any purpose hereunder will be
determined in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee) and outside
counsel, that (A) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (B) the failure
to provide non-public information concerning the Company or enter into
discussions or negotiations with such third party would reasonably be expected
to be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to its
stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (subject to the execution of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal; provided the Company will promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information that is provided to a third party concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries not previously provided to Parent. The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify Parent in the
event it receives a Company Takeover Proposal, including the material terms
and conditions thereof, and shall keep Parent reasonably apprised as to the
status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning
the same. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly (within
one Business Day) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to
begin providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company
Takeover Proposal.

      

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, (i) if the Company receives
a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal which the Board of Directors
(acting through the Special Committee if such committee still exists)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside counsel) that such Company Takeover Proposal is a Superior
Proposal (after giving effect, in the case of any determination made on or
after September 26, 2006, to all of the adjustments which may be definitively
offered by Parent pursuant to clause (B) below) and determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to
its stockholders under applicable Law, the Board of Directors (acting through
the Special Committee if such committee still exists) may (x) effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal, and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (ii) the Board
of Directors (acting through the Special Committee if such committee still
exists) may effect a Recommendation Withdrawal if the Board of Directors
(acting through the Special Committee if such committee still exists)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however,
that on and after September 26, 2006, with respect to the circumstances in
clause (i) only, the Board of Directors may not effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal (pursuant to clause x) or terminate the Agreement (pursuant to
clause y), in each case unless:

                  

(A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
five calendar days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to
effect a Recommendation Withdrawal or

                  

44

      



   



   



               

terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall
have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal; and

      

(B) prior to effecting such Recommendation Withdrawal or terminating the
Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and
outside counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover
Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the Board of Directors or
the Special Committee) a Superior Proposal.

                  

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal on or after
September 26, 2006, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.5(d)
with respect to such new written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been or is concurrently terminated
by its terms pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Company has concurrently paid to
Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3.

      

(e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
Section 6.5(b) by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 6.5(b) by the Company.

      

(f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) amend the Rights Agreement or
redeem the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement), or (ii) exempt any
Person from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section
203 of the DGCL (or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply; in each case, unless such actions are taken
simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

      

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
required disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with and receipt of
advice from its outside counsel, failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law;
provided however, any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal
unless the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee if such committee still exists) expressly publicly reaffirms the
Board Recommendation at least two Business Days prior to the Stockholders
Meeting.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
assigned below:

            

"Company Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons other than Parent or its Affiliates relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 15%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class or series of
securities of the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company
whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or
group of Persons beneficially owning 15% or more of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole);

      

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal (except that
references to 15% will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%") made in
writing and not solicited by the Company in violation of Section 6.5 that is
on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee) determines in good faith (after receiving advice from its
independent financial advisor), taking into account, among other things, all
legal, financial (including the effect of any termination fee payable),
timing, likelihood of completion (taking into account all approvals and
consents required from Governmental Authorities, third parties and
stockholders), any financing conditions or contingencies, and other aspects of
the Company Takeover Proposal and the third party making the Company Takeover
Proposal, is more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as amended from time to time.

         

Section 6.6 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

               

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall make any
required submissions under the HSR Act which the Company or Parent determines
should be made, in each case, with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and to make other required filings pursuant to other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in all cases, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that its goal is to file any
required submissions under the HSR Act within 15 Business Days after the date
of this Agreement and to file other required filings pursuant to other
Antitrust Laws within 45 calendar days after the date of this Agreement and
that if a party is not prepared to file any such submission or filing within
such period, its senior executives shall

      

46

      



   



   



   

discuss the reasons for the failure to meet such goal with the senior
executives from the other party. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or
other Laws with respect to which a filing has been made and use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or
advisable consistent with this Section 6.6 to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether any
filings are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits
or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other
federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or whether any consents, approvals
or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to
contracts or instruments material to the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
business in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

      

(b) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced, whether before
or after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously against it and respond thereto.

      

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any person (other than a
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, (i) without the prior
written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit
to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
material amount of cash or other consideration, make any material commitment
or incur any material liability or other material obligation due to such
person and (ii) except with respect to the Financing Commitments, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any material amount of cash or
other consideration, make any material commitment or to incur any material
liability or other material obligation; provided, however, that Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company the opportunity to make such payments.

      

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates to agree (i) to limit in any manner whatsoever or
not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including the
Shares), or to divest, dispose of or hold separate any securities or all or a
material portion of their respective businesses, assets or properties or a
material portion of the business, assets or properties of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to limit in any material respect the ability of
such entities (A) to conduct their respective businesses or own such material
assets or properties or to conduct the businesses or own the material
properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) to control
their respective businesses or operations or the businesses or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

      

Section 6.7 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.

      



   



   



   

(a) For a period of at least six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation (including
provisions relating to expense advancement) that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification and exculpation provisions (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by
applicable Law.

      

(b) In addition to and not in limitation of the terms of Section 6.7(a), from
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall to the greatest
extent permitted by Law (including to the greatest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may
indemnify its officers and directors) indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds for the fees and expenses of) (i) the present and former officers,
directors and employees thereof against any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative regulatory or
investigative ("Damages"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, the approval of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising
out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) such persons as are covered under the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' insurance policy in effect on the date hereof against any and all
Damages arising out of acts or omissions in connection with such persons
serving as an officer, director, member of a board of managers, or in a
functionally equivalent role or other fiduciary capacity, in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

      

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a fully pre-paid
six-year tail policy to the current policy of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained on the date hereof by the Company (the "Current
Policy") which tail policy shall cover a period from the Effective Time
through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain the same coverage and
amount as, and contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to the
coverage currently provided by the Current Policy.

      

(d) This Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and

      

48

      



   



   



   

assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume and honor the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall
not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or
former director or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.7 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

      

Section 6.8 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of
the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the
rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or
regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or
submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of
any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party); provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.8 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to
be made by the Company pursuant to Section 6.5.

               

Section 6.9 Financing.

               

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective
officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting,
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, including, without limitation, (i) participation in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, business
projections and similar documents required in connection with the Financing;
provided, however, that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in
relation to high yield debt or equity securities need not be issued by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, further that, any such memoranda
or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect
to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) using reasonable
best efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide assistance and
cooperation to Parent, including but not limited to participating in a
reasonable number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions,
providing consent to Parent to use their audit reports relating to the Company
and providing any necessary "comfort letters", (iv) executing and delivering
definitive financing documents, including pledge and security documents or
other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent (including certificates of the chief financial officer of the

      

49

      



   



   



   

Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral; provided that no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such agreement,
document or pledge shall be effective until the Effective Time; (v) providing
access to people and information as set forth in Section 6.4; (vi) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance reasonably
requested by Parent, (vii) as promptly as practicable, use reasonable best
efforts to furnish to Parent and its Financing sources with all financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company reasonably requested by
Parent including all financial statements and data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, including audits thereof to the extent so
required (which audits shall be unqualified), and the other accounting rules
and regulations of the SEC, that is of the type and form customarily included
in private placement memoranda relating to private placements under Rule 144A
of the Securities Act at the time during the Company\'s fiscal year such
offerings will be made (the "Required Financial Information"), (viii) taking
all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders
involved in the Debt Financing to evaluate the Company\'s current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish bank
and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing; provided that no right of any lender, nor
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, thereunder shall be
effective until the Effective Time; (ix) entering into one or more credit or
other agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent in connection with
the Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, the
Company shall not be required to enter into any purchase agreement for any
high-yield debt financing; provided further that no obligation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under such credit or other agreement shall be
effective until the Effective Time; and (x) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by
Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing and the direct borrowing or
incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Financing, including any high yield
debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time; provided, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation
to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided further that neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or
similar fee or incur any liability with respect to the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries), except to the extent that such losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses, directly or indirectly, resulted from or arose out of the willful
misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries\' logos as may be reasonably
necessary in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of it Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

      

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 6.9(d), Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things

      



   

50

      



   



   



   

necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters,
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment Letters
or on other terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent, (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such
definitive agreements that are within their control, (iii) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters. In furtherance of the provisions of this Section 6.9(b),
one or more Debt Commitment Letters may be amended or superseded to replace or
add one or more lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date hereof, or otherwise in manner not less beneficial to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) (the "New Debt Financing
Commitments"), provided that the New Debt Financing Commitments shall not (i)
expand or adversely amend the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters, in any material respect; (ii) reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing; or (iii) reduce the aggregate amount
of Debt Financing (unless, in the case of this clause (iii), replaced with an
amount of new equity financing on terms no less favorable to Parent than the
terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters). Upon and from and after
each such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to
mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters that are
not so superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Financing
Commitments to the extent then in effect. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letters for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources ("Alternative
Financing") on terms that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent
then as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, but in any event no later than the
last day of the Marketing Period. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, in the event that (x) all or any portion of the
Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has not been consummated,
(y) all closing conditions contained in Sections 7.1, 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) shall
have been satisfied or waived and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments (or alternative bridge financing obtained in
accordance with this Section 6.9(b)) are available on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof as
contemplated by this Section 6.9(b)), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of
such bridge financing to be used to replace such high yield financing no later
than the last day of the Marketing Period. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably apprised as to the status of, and any material developments
relating to, the Financing.

      

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such Equity
Commitment Letters that are within its control, if any, (iii) consummate the
Equity Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letters.

      

(d) In furtherance of the provisions of Section 6.9(c), Parent and Merger Sub
may enter into arrangements and agreements relating to the financing to add
other equity

      

51

      



   



   



   

providers, so long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the
following conditions are met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing
is not reduced; (ii) the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing; (iii) the
arrangements and agreements would not diminish or release the obligations of
the Investors to Parent or Merger Sub under the Equity Commitment Letters,
adversely affect the rights of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights
against the Investors under the Equity Commitment Letters, or otherwise
constitute a waiver or reduction of Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s rights under
the Equity Commitment Letters.

               

Section 6.10 Actions with Respect to Existing Debt.

               

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, the Company shall, upon receiving any written request by
Parent to do so, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly commence a tender
offer (the "Notes Tender Offer") for all of the outstanding $350,000,000
aggregate principal amount at maturity of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2011
(the "2011 Notes") and all of the outstanding $500,000,000 aggregate principal
amount at maturity of its 7.125% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes" and,
together with the 2011 Notes, the "Senior Notes"); provided, however, that if
Parent so elects in its sole discretion, in lieu of or in addition to the
Notes Tender Offer, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
facilitate a covenant defeasance pursuant to Section 8.03 of the Senior Notes
Indentures or a discharge pursuant to Section 10.01 of the Senior Notes
Indentures upon the prior or simultaneous occurrence of the Closing and the
consummation of the Financing, in either case as reasonably requested by
Parent in writing; provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation funds any
such defeasance or discharge. As part of any Notes Tender Offer, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the consent of the holders of
each series of the Senior Notes to amend, eliminate or waive certain sections
(as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) of the applicable Senior Notes
Indenture (the "Notes Consents"). The aggregate consideration payable to each
holder of Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer shall be an amount
in cash established and funded by Parent. The Notes Tender Offer shall be made
pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement prepared
by the Company in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company; provided that any such
Notes Tender Offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Section
6.10(b) (as amended from time to time, the "Notes Offer to Purchase").

      

(b) The Company\'s and the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender
Offer or make any payment for the Notes Consents shall be subject to
conditions (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), including that (i)
the Merger shall have occurred (or Parent and the Company shall be satisfied
that it will occur substantially concurrently with such acceptance and
payment), (ii) the Financing has been obtained and (iii) such other conditions
as are customary for transactions similar to the Notes Tender Offer. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer, substantially
concurrently with the Closing, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter to promptly pay for all
Senior Notes (and related Notes Consents) validly tendered and not withdrawn.
The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Notes Tender Offer as may
be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the conditions that the Notes
Tender Offer is conditioned on the Merger and the Financing as

      

52

      



   



   



   

provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above), so long as such waivers would not
cause the Notes Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"), or any other applicable Law, and shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the
Notes Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms
and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer (including any extension thereof)
other than as agreed between Parent and the Company or as required in the
reasonable judgment of the Company to comply with applicable Law.

      

(c) Upon the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.10(a), the Company shall
prepare, as promptly as practicable, the Notes Offer to Purchase, together
with any required related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary
agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and amendments
thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Notes Tender Offer
Documents"), relating to the Notes Tender Offer and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be disseminated to the record holders of the Senior
Notes, and to the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners of the
Senior Notes (collectively, the "Noteholders") the Notes Tender Offer
Documents; provided, however, that prior to the dissemination thereof, the
Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less than 5 Business Days
in advance of any such dissemination (or such shorter period of time as is
reasonably practicable in light of when Parent requests that the Company
commence the Notes Tender Offer) and shall consult with Parent with respect to
the Notes Tender Offer Documents and shall include in such Notes Tender Offer
Documents all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company. Upon request, Parent shall provide the Company with any
information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents which may be
required under applicable Law and reasonably requested by the Company. If at
any time prior to the acceptance of Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender
Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable Law to be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes Tender Offer
Documents, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and
disseminate such amendment or supplement; provided, however, that prior to
such dissemination, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not
less than two Business Days (or such shorter period of time as is reasonably
necessary in light of the circumstances) in advance of any such dissemination
and shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement and
shall include in such amendment or supplement all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, the TIA, and any other applicable Law in
connection with the Notes Tender Offer.

      

(d) Promptly following the expiration of the consent solicitation, assuming
the requisite consents from Noteholders (including from Persons holding
proxies from the Noteholders) have been received, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause appropriate supplemental indentures (the
"Supplemental Indentures") to become effective providing for the amendments of
the Senior Notes Indentures contemplated in the Notes Tender Offer Documents;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that the Supplemental
Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth
therein shall not become operative unless and until all conditions to the
Notes Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived by the Company in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof and the Surviving Corporation accepts all
Senior Notes (and related Notes Consents) validly tendered for purchase and
payment pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer, whereupon such proposed amendments
shall

      

53

      



   



   



   

become operative. The form and substance of the Supplemental Indentures shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.

that would make the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 or Section 7.3 on the Closing Date impossible or reasonably unlikely. Each
such notification shall include a certification of an officer of Parent and
Merger Sub that such notification is being delivered in accordance with this
Section 6.11(b). No such notification shall be given any effect for purposes

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur at or prior
to the Effective Time, as applicable.

      

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall either (i) maintain for the benefit of the current or former
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee"),
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Benefit Plans and Foreign Plans
(other than equity based benefits, individual employment agreements and any
plans, programs or arrangements providing benefits or payments upon a change
in control) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement
taking into account modifications in plans or arrangements contemplated prior
to the Effective Time (which contemplated modifications are set forth on
Section 6.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and provide compensation and
benefits to each Company Employee under the

      

54

      



   



   



   

Benefit Plans or Foreign Plans or any other employee benefit plans or other
compensation arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) provide compensation and benefits (other than equity
based benefits, individual employment agreements and any plans, programs or
arrangements providing benefits or payments upon a change in control) to each
Company Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value that is not less
favorable in the aggregate than the benefits (other than equity based
benefits, individual employment agreements and any plans, programs or
arrangements providing benefits or payments upon a change in control) provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Comparable
Plans") taking into account modifications to such benefits contemplated prior
to the Effective Time (which contemplated modifications are set forth on
Section 6.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter).

      

(c) To the extent that a Benefit Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to
any Company Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be granted to such Company Employee credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Benefit Plans)
(such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any
such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Company Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

      

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision
of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period
of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
terminate, any Company Employee for any reason or (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.12,
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Effective Time.

necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

                     

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

                        

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned (notwithstanding approval thereof by the Requisite Stockholder
Vote) prior to the Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being
an effective termination by Merger Sub):

      

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

      

(b) by either the Company or Parent if any Governmental Authority of

      



   

competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree or ruling shall have become final and non-
appealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to contest, appeal and remove such order, decree or ruling;

      

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before May 15, 2007 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however,
that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to May 15, 2007, then
the Outside Date shall be extended to the earlier of (x) June 30, 2007 and (y)
the end of the Marketing Period (and in such event, the term "Outside Date"
shall mean the earlier of such extended dates); and provided further, that if
the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date is the result
of any action taken by a party hereto, or the failure of a party hereto to
take any action, and such action or failure to take action was a breach of
such party\'s obligations under this Agreement, then such party shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

      

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if the Requisite Stockholder Vote shall
not have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken;

      

(e) by the Company:

            

(i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement

      



         

on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a)
or (b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date; provided, however, that the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1, 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied;

      

(ii) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing) and (B) on or prior to the last day of the Marketing Period,
none of Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall have received
the proceeds of the Debt Financing; or

and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.5(d).

      

58

      



   



   



   

(f) by Parent:

            

(i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement

      



         

on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or (b)
not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date; provided, however, that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in
material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1, 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

      

(ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A)
shall have effected a Recommendation Withdrawal, (B) shall have recommended to
the stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal other than the
Merger, or (C) shall have failed to call the Stockholders Meeting in breach of
its obligations under this Agreement to do so.

to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except Sections 6.4(b), 6.8, this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, will survive such termination;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub from liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, as the case may be, as a result of any willful breach of
any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement; provided, further, that in no event,
whether or not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company be
entitled to monetary damages in excess of $300,000,000 in the aggregate,
inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, for all losses and
damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives and Affiliates, or
arising from any other claim or cause of action under this Agreement.

any Related Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letters) have any
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby except as specifically provided in the
Guarantees.

               

Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.

connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

      

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii), then the

following termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(f)(ii).

            

" In the event that this Agreement is terminated by:

      

59

      



   



   



         

(i) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c), provided (x) the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement has not been consummated by the
Outside Date other than as a result of actions taken by Parent, or Parent\'s
failure to take action, and such action or failure to take action was a breach
of Parent \'s obligations under this Agreement, and (y) at any time prior to
the termination a Company Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or
publicly made known and not withdrawn, and (z) if within twelve months after
such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Company Takeover
Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced or made known),
then, on the date of, and as a condition to, such execution or consummation,
the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee as directed in writing to
Parent;

      

(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (or, after the
Stockholder Meeting has been held and a vote on the adoption of this Agreement
has been taken and there has been a failure by the Company to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Vote, and this Agreement thereby becomes terminable for
this reason, the Company terminates this Agreement for another reason),
provided (x) prior to the Stockholders Meeting a Company Takeover Proposal has
been publicly announced or publicly made known and not withdrawn, and (y) if
within twelve months after such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same as that
originally announced or made known), then, on the date of such execution or
consummation, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee as directed in
writing to Parent, less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to
Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(d) by the Company; or

      

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i), provided (x) prior to the
breach giving rise to the right of termination, a Company Takeover Proposal
has been publicly announced or publicly made known and not withdrawn, and (y)
if within twelve months after such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same as that
originally announced or made known), then, on the date of, and as a condition
to, such execution or consummation, the Company shall pay the Company
Termination Fee as directed in writing to Parent.

      

For purposes of this Section 8.3(c), the term "Company Takeover Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.5(h), except that
all references to 15% therein shall be deemed to be references to "more than
50%".

      

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 8.1(d) under
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to this Section 8.3, then the Company shall pay promptly (but in any
event within two Business Days) following receipt of an invoice therefor all
of Parent\'s actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and
its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Parent Expenses") as
directed by Parent in writing, which amount shall not be greater than $50
million; provided, however, that the existence of circumstances which could

      

60

      



   



   



   

require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(ii) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.3(d); and
provided, further, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant
to this Section 8.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c)
except to the extent indicated in Section 8.3(c)(ii).

      

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(ii), then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination
Fee promptly (but in any event within two Business Days) following such
termination by the Company.

      

(f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), 8.3(c), 8.3(d)
or 8.3(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the party entitled to receive such payment. The parties
hereto agree and understand that in no event shall the Company or Parent be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee,
respectively, on more than one occasion. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement, and that
any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not constitute a penalty.
If the Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent any amounts due
to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 8.3 or Parent fails to pay
the Company any amounts due to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3 within
the time periods specified in this Section 8.3, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by Parent or the Company, as applicable, in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment
of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street
Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required
to be paid until the date of actual payment.

      

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if in the
circumstances in which Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination
Fee, Parent is not otherwise in breach of this Agreement such that (but for
Parent\'s failure to satisfy their obligations under Section 2.2) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and 7.3(b) would otherwise be satisfied
(any such event, a "Non-Breach Financing Failure"), then the Company\'s
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) and receipt of
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or the
guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantees shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors and any of their respective former, current or future directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, Affiliates,
stockholders, assignees or representatives of any of the foregoing (each a
"Specified Person") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of the Parent Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(e), none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors or any of their respective Specified Persons shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) in no event, whether or
not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company be entitled
to monetary damages in excess of $300,000,000 in the aggregate, inclusive of
the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, for all losses and damages arising
from or

      

61

      



   



   



   

in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives and Affiliates, or arising from any other claim or
cause of action under this Agreement.

      

Section 8.4 Procedure for Termination. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, action by its board of directors or, to the
extent permitted by Law, the duly authorized designee of its board of
directors, and in the case of the Company, to the extent permitted by Law,
action by the Special Committee if such committee still exists or its Board of
Directors if the Special Committee no longer exists. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company.

contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; provided,
however, that, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, no amendment may be made which under applicable Law requires the
further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto.

      

Section 9.7 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained for the benefit
of such party contained herein; provided that for so long as the Special
Committee exists, the Company may not take any such action unless previously
authorized by the Special Committee. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

      

Section 9.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Section 6.7 (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein, and may be
enforced by any such Persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

      

Section 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.

               

Section 9.10 Remedies.

               

(a) The Company agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in
connection with this Agreement (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent
and Merger Sub for such losses or damages shall be limited to $300,000,000,
inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, (ii) the maximum
liability of each Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the
express obligation of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, and (iii) in no
event shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such
amount from Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or their respective
Representatives and Affiliates in connection therewith; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not diminish the Company\'s rights to specifically enforce the
terms of the Equity Commitment Letters in connection with the Company\'s
exercise of its rights under Section 9.10(b) hereof to specifically enforce
this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof. Accordingly, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 9.10(b), however,
the parties acknowledge that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement only to
prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those covenants of Parent or
Merger Sub that require Parent or Merger Sub to (x) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Financing, including without limitation, the covenants
set forth in Section 6.6 (Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts) and Section
6.9 (Financing) and (y) consummate the Merger, if in the case of this clause
(y), the financing provided for in the Financing Commitments (and, if
Alternative Financing is being used, pursuant to the Alternative Financing) is
available to be drawn down by Parent pursuant to the terms of the applicable
agreements but is not so drawn down solely as a result of Parent refusing to
do so in breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not
the Company is entitled to seek injunctions or specific performance pursuant
to the provisions of the preceding sentence or otherwise, in no event will the
Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of $300,000,000 in the
aggregate, inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, for losses
or damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives and Affiliates, or
arising from any other claim or cause of action under this Agreement.

               

Section 9.11 Jurisdiction.

               

(a) In any action or proceeding between any of the parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
in the case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Delaware); (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such
Federal court); (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (and, if applicable, such Federal court); and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court). Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
9.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

      

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO

      

65

      



   

INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR

      

OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.11.

      

Section 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      

Section 9.13 Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
