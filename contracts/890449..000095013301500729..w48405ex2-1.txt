AND MERGER   SECTION 2.1 THE OFFER.   (a) Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated and subject to the terms hereof, within ten
(10) business days after the public announcement of the execution hereof by
the parties, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT")), the Offer for all of the Shares, at the
Offer Price. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay for
any Shares tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to
accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered) shall be subject only
to (i) the condition that at least a majority of Shares on a fully-diluted
basis (including for purposes of such calculation all Shares issuable upon
exercise of all vested Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 3.4(a)
and unvested Company Stock Options that vest (or upon consummation of the
Offer will vest) prior to the Final Date (as defined in Section 9.1), but
excluding any Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) be
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer or
otherwise already be beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser (the "MINIMUM
CONDITION"), and (ii) the satisfaction or the waiver by Purchaser of the
other conditions set forth in Annex A. Purchaser expressly reserves the right
to waive any such condition, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however,
that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, no change may be
made that (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer in
addition to those set forth in Annex A, (v) amends the conditions set forth
in Annex A to broaden the scope of such conditions, (vi) amends any other
term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares, (vii)
extends the Offer except as provided in Section 2.1(b), or (viii) amends or
waives the Minimum Condition. It is agreed that the conditions set forth in
Annex A are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be waived by
Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time,
in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, as to which prior
written approval of the Company is required. The failure by Parent and
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.   (b) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on
the date that is twenty-five (25) business days after the date the Offer is
commenced; provided, however, that without the consent of the Company\'s
Board of Directors (the "COMPANY BOARD"), Purchaser may (i) from time to time
extend the Offer, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the
conditions to the Offer shall not have been     7  13  satisfied or
waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived; (ii)
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; or (iii)
extend the Offer for any reason on one or more occasions for an aggregate
period of not more than ten (10) business days beyond the latest expiration
date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this
sentence if on such expiration date there shall not have been tendered at
least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares; provided, further, that
in no event shall the Offer expire prior to the close of business on June 15,
2001. Parent and Purchaser agree that, if any one or more of the conditions
to the Offer set forth on Annex A are not satisfied and none of the events
set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of Annex A that would permit
Purchaser not to accept tendered Shares for payment has occurred and is
continuing at the time of any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then,
provided, that such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied,
Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time unless any such condition
is no longer reasonably capable of being satisfied or any such event has
occurred; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser be required
to extend the Offer beyond the Final Date. Purchaser may provide a
"subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange
Act) of not less than three business days following its acceptance of and
payment for the Shares in the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to
accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Purchaser accept for payment and pay for Shares in the Offer prior to June
15, 2001.   (c) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is
commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect
to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase (or portions thereof) and forms of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement. Parent and Purchaser
agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and all
amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the "OFFER
DOCUMENTS") to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable laws. Parent and
Purchaser further agree that the Offer Documents, on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company\'s shareholders, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the Company or any of
its stockholders in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents. The Company agrees that the information
provided by the Company in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect,     8  14  and Parent and Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be
disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Purchaser agree to provide in writing to the Company and its counsel
any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of

Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.   SECTION
2.2 COMPANY ACTIONS.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer and represents that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and
held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) after
evaluating the Merger, unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to and are otherwise in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii) unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, in all respects; and (iii) unanimously resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their
Shares thereunder to Purchaser and approve and adopt this Agreement. To the
extent that such recommendation is not withdrawn in accordance with Section
6.5 hereof, the Company consents to the inclusion of such recommendation and
approval in the Offer Documents. The Company also represents that the Company
has received the opinion of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Inc., financial
advisor to the Company Board (the "FINANCIAL ADVISOR"), to the effect that,
as of the date of this Agreement, the Offer Price and the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of the Company Common Stock,
other than Parent and its Affiliates, pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company has been
authorized by the Financial Advisor to permit the inclusion in its entirety
of its opinion (or a reference thereto, subject to prior review and approval
by the Financial Advisor) in the Offer to Purchase, the Schedule 14D-9 and
the Proxy Statement, as applicable.   (b) The Company shall file with the
SEC, concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the
"SCHEDULE 14D-9") containing the recommendations described in Section 2.2(a)
and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company, together with the Offer Documents, as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Offer. The Company agrees that it shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable law. The Company
further agrees that the Schedule 14D-9, on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no representation or warranty is made by the     9  15  Company with
respect to information supplied by Parent or Purchaser in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser agree that the information provided by
them specifically in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and be disseminated to the Company\'s
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide in writing to Parent and
its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments.   (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or
shall cause its transfer agent, promptly following a request by Parent, to,
furnish Parent with such information, including updated lists of the
stockholders of the Company, mailing labels and updated lists of security
positions, and such assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request
in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Purchaser and their agents
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will
destroy, and will use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to
destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control.   SECTION 2.3 BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND
COMMITTEES; SECTION 14(f) OF  EXCHANGE ACT.   (a) Promptly upon the
purchase by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer and from time to time
thereafter, if the Minimum Condition has been met, and subject to the second
to last sentence of this Section 2.3(a), Parent shall be entitled to
designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board as will give Parent representation on the
Company Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this Section 2.3) and the percentage that the number of Shares
owned by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates bears to the total number of
outstanding Shares. The Company shall use its best efforts to, upon request
by Parent, promptly, at the Company\'s election, either increase the size of
the Company Board or secure the resignation of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board and to cause Parent\'s designees to be so elected or appointed.
At such times, and subject to the second to last sentence of this Section
2.3(a), the Company shall use its best efforts to cause the individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board
(other than any committee of the Company Board     10  16  established
to take action under this Agreement), (ii) each Board of Directors of each
Subsidiary (subject to applicable law) and (iii) each committee of each such
Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use its
best efforts to ensure that two of the members of the Company Board as of the
date hereof and who are not officers of the Company or Affiliates of
Parent (the "CONTINUING DIRECTORS") shall remain members of such Board until
the Effective Time (as defined below). If a Continuing Director resigns from,
or no longer serves on, the Company Board, Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall permit the remaining Continuing Director or Directors to appoint the
resigning Director\'s successor who shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director.   (b) The Company\'s obligation to appoint designees to
the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
action required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 2.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors
as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 2.3. Parent shall supply to the Company in
writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such section
and Rule.   (c) Following the date of the election or appointment
of Parent\'s designees to the Company Board pursuant to this Section 2.3 and
prior to the Effective Time, if there shall be any Continuing Directors, (i)
any amendment of this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement by the
Company, (ii) any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser or any waiver of
any of the Company\'s rights hereunder or (iii) any other determination with
respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by the Company relating
to this Agreement, will require the concurrence of a majority of such
Continuing Directors.   SECTION 2.4 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 2.6), Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company in accordance
with the DGCL. Also at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") in accordance with
the DGCL and with all the rights, privileges, properties, franchises,
immunities and powers, and subject to all the duties and liabilities, of a
corporation organized under the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL (including, without limitation, Section 259 of the
DGCL).   SECTION 2.5 CLOSING. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 9.1, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII, the closing of the Merger (the
"CLOSING") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second business
day following the date on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII shall be fulfilled or waived in
accordance with this Agreement (the "CLOSING DATE"), at the offices of Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless
another date, time or place is agreed to by the parties hereto.     11 
17   SECTION 2.6 EFFECTIVE TIME. The parties hereto shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "DELAWARE SECRETARY OF
STATE") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as the parties may agree)
a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such later time specified
in such certificate of merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   SECTION 2.7
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as
provided by the DGCL.   SECTION 2.8 BYLAWS. The Bylaws of Purchaser in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as
provided by the DGCL.   SECTION 2.9 DIRECTORS. The directors of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors
shall have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in effect following the Effective
Time.   SECTION 2.10 OFFICERS. The officers of Purchaser immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in effect following the Effective
Time.   SECTION 2.11 EFFECT ON COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK.   (a) Outstanding
Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Dissenting Shares or Shares cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.11(b) below) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive
from Parent net cash in an amount equal to $18.50 per share (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"). The aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of Shares
in accordance with this Section 2.11(a), together with the aggregate amount
of cash to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options in accordance with
Section 2.11(d),is referred to herein as the "AGGREGATE MERGER
CONSIDERATION."   (b) Treasury Shares; Purchaser Shares. Each Share that is
held as a treasury share by the Company at the Effective Time (collectively,
the "TREASURY SHARES") and each Share owned by Parent or Purchaser
(whether purchased in the Offer or otherwise) (the "PURCHASER SHARES"),
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company or Parent, be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, without any
conversion thereof.     12  18   (c) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a
stockholder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under
the provisions of the DGCL (collectively, "DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be
converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but shall instead entitle the holder thereof to receive
payment therefor as shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, each Share of such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.11(a), and such shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of Shares received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise
negotiate, any such demands.   (d) Company Stock Options. Effective as of
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action, including
obtaining the consent of the individual option holders, if necessary, to
cancel, at the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (each, a
"COMPANY STOCK OPTION") that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not
vested and exercisable as of such date. As consideration therefor, each
holder of a cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to be paid by
the Surviving Corporation at Closing, with respect to each Share subject to a
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of
$18.50 (or any such higher price paid to holders of Shares in the Offer or
Merger) over the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option. The
right to cash payments pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) to holders of Company
Stock Options in settlement of the cancellation of Company Stock Options
shall be made with respect to all outstanding Company Stock Options at the
Effective Time, regardless of whether any such Company Stock Option was fully
vested or exercisable at such time.   (e) Impact of Stock Splits, etc. In
the event of any change in Shares between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the
like, the Merger Consideration for each outstanding Share, as provided in
this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account such
change in the Shares.   SECTION 2.12 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK OF PURCHASER.
Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation, and such shares shall, collectively, represent all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, following the
Effective Time.   13  19   SECTION 2.13 PAYMENT FOR SHARES IN THE MERGER;
COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) Paying Agent. At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company selected by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "PAYING AGENT"), for
the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Treasury Shares, Purchaser
Shares and Dissenting Shares) and holders of Company Stock Options, cash in
immediately available same-day funds in an amount equal to the Aggregate
Merger Consideration (the "PAYMENT FUND").   (b) Exchange Procedures for
Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate or certificates (which have not been cancelled or retired) which
prior thereto represented Shares shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
such certificate or certificates and acceptance thereof by the Paying Agent,
be entitled to receive for each Share surrendered the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.11(a). The Paying Agent shall accept such certificates
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with its
normal exchange practices. If any Merger Consideration is to be delivered to
any person other than the person in whose name the certificate or
certificates representing the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the certificate or
certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the certificate(s) surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the
Company or of its transfer agent of certificates representing Shares, and if
any such certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as hereinabove
provided. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.13(b), each
certificate representing Shares (other than certificates
representing Dissenting Shares, or Treasury Shares or Purchaser Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with the terms of Section 2.11(c) of this Agreement)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon, as contemplated by Section 2.11(a).   (c) Letter of
Transmittal. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than
five business days thereafter), Parent shall require the Paying Agent to mail
to each record holder of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares , which have been converted pursuant to Section
2.11(a), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of certificates representing Shares to the Paying Agent, and which
shall be in such form and have such provisions as Parent reasonably may
specify) and instructions for use in surrendering such certificates and
receiving the relevant Merger Consideration to which such holder shall be
entitled therefor pursuant to Section 2.11(a).   (d) No Further Ownership
Rights in Shares. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of certificates representing Shares (other than Dissenting Shares,
Treasury Shares or Purchaser Shares) in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore    14  20  represented by
such certificates, subject, however, to Parent\'s obligation (if any) to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been declared by the Company on the Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.   (e) Payment in
Respect of Company Stock Options. At or promptly following the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall deliver to the Paying Agent a schedule
showing the name of all former holders of Company Stock Options and the
amounts due to each such holder pursuant to Section 2.11(d), a copy of which
is included as Section 2.13(e) of the Disclosure Letter. The Paying
Agent shall promptly deliver that portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration to holders of Company Stock Options in accordance with such
schedule.   (f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of certificates representing
Shares or holders of Company Stock Options for 240 days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II and holders of Company
Stock Options shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of their claims for any Merger Consideration or
payments in respect of Company Stock Options.   (g) No Liability. Neither
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any cash, shares, dividends or distributions payable from the
Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any certificates representing
Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time, or any payments shall not have been made to former holders of
Company Stock Options in accordance with Section 2.13(e) above at such time,
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority) any such cash, shares, dividends or
distributions payable in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (h) Withholding of Tax. Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration or payments in respect of Company
Stock Options otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Shares or Company Stock Options such amount as Parent (or any
affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of Shares or Company Stock Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

and advise Parent of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement
received from the staff of the SEC. The Company will provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any

Parent a copy of all such filings with the SEC.   (b) The Company agrees and
represents and warrants that the information supplied or to be supplied by it
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the     38 
44  Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the Company Stockholders contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in
any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the
same meeting or subject matter thereof which has become false or misleading.
The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, except in each case with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement supplied
by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein as
to which the Company assumes no responsibility.   (c) Parent agrees and
represents and warrants that the information supplied or to be supplied by it
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company
Stockholders contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same

SECTION 6.2 COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.   (a) If required by the DGCL or
other applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company agrees
that it will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to convene a meeting of the
Company Stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER MEETING") to submit to the
Company Stockholders this Agreement, together (subject to Section 6.5(c)
below) with the affirmative recommendation of the Company Board regarding
this Agreement and the Merger. If required by the DGCL or other applicable
law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and obtain the
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders(the
"COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL") as soon as practicable after the consummation
of the Offer and, so long as the recommendation of the Company Board has not
been withdrawn or modified in accordance with Section 6.5(c), to obtain the
favorable votes of the Company Stockholders.   (b) Except as may otherwise
be permitted by Section 6.5(c), in the Proxy Statement the Company Board
shall: (i) express their opinion to the Company Stockholders that this
Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests of the Company and the
Company Stockholders and should be adopted and approved; and (ii) recommend
to the Company Stockholders that they vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement.   (c) Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees to
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all
other Shares owned by Parent or any other subsidiary of Parent.     39 
45   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent, Purchaser
and/or any other Affiliate of Parent shall acquire at least ninety percent
(90%) of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of the parties
hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a
meeting of stockholders, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.  
SECTION 6.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to,
give to Parent and its counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives and agents, all reasonable access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to any and all of their
respective premises, properties, contracts, books and records, and will cause
their respective officers and employees to furnish to Parent and its
representatives, except where prohibited by law, any and all data and
information pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the Company or the
Subsidiaries that Parent shall from time to time reasonably request, and
shall permit Parent and its representatives to make extracts and copies
thereof. During such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i)
each written report on examination of financial condition or market conduct
(whether in draft or final form) of any of the Insurance Companies issued by
any applicable Governmental Authority, (ii) all material filings with state
insurance regulators made by either Insurance Company under the insurance
holding company statutes of its domiciliary state, (iii) all material
correspondence or communications with state insurance regulatory authorities
concerning the companies, including without limitation such items relating to
rehabilitation, insolvency, liquidation, supervision, or other comparable
state proceedings, (iv) all filings made by the Company or any Subsidiary
with the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or other
Governmental Authority under the Securities Laws or any applicable state law,
and (v) all other information and documents concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request. The Company shall, and shall cause the Insurance
Companies to, consult with Parent with respect to any written or oral
communication concerning, in whole or in part, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and directed to any state insurance department or other
Governmental Authority, any rating agency, any agent or other producer, or
any policyholder, and, to the extent reasonably practicable and unless
otherwise prohibited by applicable law, shall permit a representative of
Parent to attend any meetings (telephonic or otherwise, but excluding Company
Board or committee meetings) with any such parties at which the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are reasonably likely to be discussed;
provided, however, that the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied the
foregoing provisions of this sentence with respect to the Company\'s or
the Insurance Companies\' discussions, in the ordinary course of business,
with agents and other producers and with policyholders if such discussions
follow a script or other plan of communication mutually agreed-upon by the
Company and Parent; and provided, further, that the Company shall be deemed
to have satisfied the foregoing provisions of this sentence with respect to
the responses of senior employees of the Company or the Insurance Companies
to unsolicited inquiries by agents, producers or policyholders if such
responses are conceptually consistent with the mutually agreed-upon plan of
communication. Except as required by law or the rules of regulations of
Nasdaq or any national stock exchange, each of Parent and the Company agree
that, until the earlier of (i) two years from the date of this Agreement and
(ii) the Effective Time, each of Parent, the Company, and their respective
subsidiaries will not, and Parent and the Company will cause their respective
directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives and affiliates     40 
46  (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") not to, disclose any nonpublic
information obtained from Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to any
other person, in whole or in part, other than to its Representatives in
connection with an evaluation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each of Parent, the Company and their respective subsidiaries
will not, and Parent and the Company will cause their respective
Representatives not to, use any of such nonpublic information to directly or
indirectly divert or attempt to divert any business, customer, Producer,
officer or employee of the other.   SECTION 6.4 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The
parties hereto will consult with each other and will mutually agree (the
agreement of each party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) upon the
content and timing of any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or
any stock exchange regulations as advised by counsel; provided, however, that
each party will give prior notice to the other parties of the content and
timing of any such press release or other public statement required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
securities exchange or any stock exchange regulations.   SECTION 6.5
ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.   (a) From and after the date hereof, without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of the Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use its
best efforts to cause the Financial Advisor and its and the Subsidiaries\'
other Representatives not to, (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate
or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitation, initiation,
encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any persons conducted
heretofore by it or its Representatives with respect to the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Board may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a
part thereof, making any counterproposal) with or furnish information to any
third party making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (a "POTENTIAL
ACQUIROR") or approve an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if the Company
Board or any special committee thereof determines, after consultation with
its financial advisor, that such Potential Acquiror has the
financial wherewithal to be reasonably capable of consummating such an
Acquisition Proposal, and the Company Board determines in good faith (A)
after consultation with such financial advisor, that such third party has
submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal which is a Superior
Proposal, and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such
information or approve an Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the
Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company agrees that any
non-public information furnished to a Potential Acquiror will be pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement containing customary confidentiality and
standstill provisions. In the event that the Company shall determine to
provide any information as described above, or shall receive any Acquisition
Proposal, it shall promptly     41  47  inform Parent in writing as to
the fact that information is to be provided and shall furnish Parent the
identity of the recipient of such information and/or the Potential Acquiror
and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company will inform
Parent promptly of any material changes or amendment to the essential terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company expressly agrees and
acknowledges that (i) nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall in any
way be construed to be an authorization by Parent of the acceptance of any
Superior Proposal, it being understood that Parent expressly disclaims any
implication that Parent may be deemed to have consented to the acceptance of
a Superior Proposal by virtue of the provisions of this Section 6.5 and (ii)
the sole purpose of this Section 6.5 is to permit the termination of this
Agreement by the Company in accordance with Section 9.1(b)(vi) in the event
the conditions set forth in this Section 6.5 are satisfied.   (b) Subject
to Section 6.5(c) below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or
committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(b) above, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation
of this Agreement or the Merger, and approve or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal in the event that (i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet
been obtained, and (ii) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and that,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Board\'s or any such
committee\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, that
prior to any such withdrawal or modification of the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) of this
Agreement or the Merger, and approval or recommendation of any Superior
Proposal, the Company shall (A) notify Parent in writing that it intends to
enter into an agreement relating to a Superior Proposal (which notice shall
include the most recent draft of such agreement), (B) during the five
business days following the Company\'s notice, the Company shall have offered
Parent the opportunity to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of its offer such that any Acquisition Proposal is no longer a Superior
Proposal, and (C) the Company Board (or committee thereof) shall
have concluded, after termination of the five-day period, that the
Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Company\'s obligations to provide
notice hereunder continues to be a Superior Proposal. The Company may not
terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1(b)(vi) in connection with a
Superior Proposal unless contemporaneously therewith the Company pays to
Parent in immediately available funds the Termination Amount pursuant to
Section 9.2 below. The Company agrees that it will not enter into a binding
agreement relating to a Superior Proposal until at least the sixth business
day after it has provided the notice to Parent described above. The Company
further agrees that it shall notify Parent promptly if the Company has
changed its intention with respect to entering into the agreement identified
in the notice provided hereunder, whether as a result of Parent modifying its
offer or otherwise.     42  48   SECTION 6.6 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND
FILINGS. Parent and the Company will as promptly as practicable (but in no
event more than 15 days after the date of this Agreement) make and cause
their respective subsidiaries and, to the extent necessary, their other
affiliates to make all necessary filings, including, without limitation,
those required under the HSR Act, applicable state insurance laws, and the
Securities Laws in order to facilitate the prompt consummation of the Offer
and Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, Parent and the Company will each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, and will cooperate fully and in good faith with each
other, (a) to comply as promptly as practicable with all governmental
requirements applicable to the Offer and Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain as promptly as practicable
all necessary permits, orders or other consents of Governmental Authorities
and consents of all third parties necessary for the consummation of the Offer
and Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly provide such information and communications
to Governmental Authorities as such Governmental Authorities may
reasonably request. Each of the parties hereto shall provide to the other
parties copies of all applications in advance of filing or submission of such
applications to Governmental Authorities in connection with this Agreement
and shall make such revisions thereto as reasonably requested by each other
party hereto. Each of the parties hereto shall provide to the other parties
the opportunity to participate in all meetings and material conversations
with Governmental Authorities with respect to the matters contemplated by
this Agreement.   SECTION 6.7 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.  
(a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification at least as
favorable as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof, and none of such provisions
shall be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the individuals who, as of the date hereof, are directors or
officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in respect of actions
or omissions occurring after the Recapitalization Effective Date, but prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) In addition to the agreements set forth in Section 6.7(a) above,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
jointly and severally shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been
at any time after the Recapitalization Effective Date, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries (and each such person\'s heirs, executors and
administrators) (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable
attorney\'s fees and expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to
the written consent of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), amounts paid in settlement, including
the advancement of expenses relating thereto, arising out of threatened,
pending or completed actions, suits or other proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative or other type whatsoever, occurring
after the Recapitalization Effective Date that are, in whole or in part,
based on or arising out of the fact that such person is     43  49  or
was a director or officer of such party. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Parent agrees that, in the event it shall transfer or otherwise
dispose of a significant amount of its assets, it shall purchase and maintain
in full force and effect claims-made directors\' and officers\' insurance and
indemnification policies ("DandO; INSURANCE") for a period ending no earlier
than the date that is six years following the Effective Date and in coverage
amounts at least as much and on other terms and conditions comparable to the
DandO; Insurance policies maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement.   (c) In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or
liability (whether or not arising before the Effective Time), (i)
Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements
therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon
request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, in either
case to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL and upon receipt of any
affirmation and undertaking required by the DGCL, (ii) Parent will cooperate
in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with
the standards set forth under the DGCL and the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws shall be made by independent counsel
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm
with respect to each related matter except to the extent there is, in the
opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between positions
of any two or more Indemnified Parties.   (d) The provisions of this Section
6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his heirs and his personal representatives and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
and the Company.   SECTION 6.8 [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK].   SECTION 6.9

Insurance Companies with applicable state regulators, or by any other
Subsidiary with an applicable regulatory body, including all
exhibits, interrogatories, notes and schedules thereto and any actuarial
opinion, affirmation or certification filed in connection therewith (the
"POST-SIGNING GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" or the "POST-SIGNING SAP FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS," as applicable, and collectively, the "POST-SIGNING FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"). In addition, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable,
provide to Parent all internally prepared management reports and all other
financial data and other information relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent, provided, however, the Company
shall not be required to provide the foregoing if prohibited by the
provisions of the HSR Act or any other laws.     44  50   SECTION 6.10
EMPLOYEE MATTERS. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall and, following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor the obligations of the Company or any of the

consulting, termination, severance, change of control and indemnification
agreements between and among the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director, consultant or employee of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries. The Company shall not amend, modify or terminate any
such Benefit Plans or agreements if any Shares shall have been purchased in
the Offer without the consent of the Continuing Directors if the consummation
of the Offer would not have the same legal effect thereunder as
the Merger.   SECTION 6.11 REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS. At the Closing,
Parent will repay in full all of the senior indebtedness of the Company and
the Subsidiaries.   SECTION 6.12 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any Takeover Statute
is or may become applicable to the Merger, each of Parent and the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on the Merger.   SECTION 6.13 NOTICE,
EFFORTS TO REMEDY. Each party hereto shall promptly give written notice to
the other parties hereto upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event
which would cause or constitute a breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of such party contained in this Agreement and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any change, in each case on a
consolidated basis, in the normal course of the Company\'s or
the Subsidiaries\' businesses or in the operation of its or their properties
having a Company Material Adverse Effect and of the receipt by the Company or
any Subsidiary of notice of any governmental complaints, investigations or
hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) or
the receipt by the Company or any Subsidiary of a notice of the institution
or the threat of litigation involving the Company or any Subsidiary which,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of any change on a
consolidated basis in the normal course of Parent\'s business or in the
operation of its properties having a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and of
the receipt by Parent of notice of any governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicting that the same may be
contemplated) or the receipt by Parent of a notice of the institution or the
threat of litigation involving Parent which, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.13 to the contrary, the authority
to manage the Company and its Subsidiaries at all times shall remain with the
management of the Company, and management of the Company and the Subsidiaries
shall not consult with employees and representatives of Parent on any matter
if such consultation would violate the provisions of the HSR Act or any other
laws.     45  51   ARTICLE VII   COVENANTS RELATING TO  CONDUCT OF
