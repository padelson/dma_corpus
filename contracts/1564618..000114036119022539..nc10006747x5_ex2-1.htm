      not to, directly or indirectly, (i)&#160;initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any
      Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, have or participate in any discussions with any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with

      than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.12) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal.&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and

      or IBTX, as applicable, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.&#160; Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
      to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition
      Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
      including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.&#160; Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries

      more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any tender offer (including a
      self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
      in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other
