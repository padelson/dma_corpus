Preferred Shares owned by the Investor and its Permitted Transferees at the time of the exchange,

unless it effects the exchange described in this Section&nbsp;4.7. When issued, the Spinco Preferred
shall entitle the holder thereof to the payment of the accrued and unpaid dividends on the
exchanged Preferred Shares (whether or not declared) to the date of the spin-off. The exchange

is the fair market value of Spinco and the denominator of which is the sum of the fair market value
of the Company and the fair market value of Spinco. The fair market value for this purpose shall
be based upon the expected public trading price of the Spinco common equity securities on a fully
distributed basis and the expected public trading price of the Company&#146;s Voting Common Stock
following the distribution of the Spinco common equity securities, and determined as though neither
the Preferred Shares nor the Spinco Preferred were outstanding. In determining fair market values,
any equity interest in Spinco retained by the Company will be disregarded in determining the fair
market value of the Company. The fair market value of Spinco will be determined on a fully
distributed (100% of the common equity) basis. The Company will provide to the Investor the
Company&#146;s estimate of the Spin-off Value Percentage (together with appropriate supporting
material). If the Investor does not agree with the Company&#146;s estimate, it may object in writing
within 10&nbsp;days of receipt of the Company&#146;s estimate. In the event of such an objection, the chief
executive officers of the Investor and the Company shall promptly meet to resolve the objection and
to agree upon the Spin-off Value Percentage. If the chief executive officers are unable to agree
on the Spin-off Value Percentage during the 10-day period following the delivery of the Investor&#146;s
objection, the Appraisal Procedure may be invoked by either party to determine the Spin-off Value
Percentage by delivery of a written notification thereof not later than the 30th day after delivery
of the Investor&#146;s objection.

liability arising hereunder or by reason hereof shall be assignable by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to assign any right, remedy, obligation
or liability hereunder without such consent shall be void, except (i)&nbsp;an assignment, in the case of

all of its assets, to the entity which is the survivor of such merger or consolidation or the
purchaser in such sale or (ii)&nbsp;an assignment by Investor, upon one business day&#146;s notice to the

application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been
held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a
suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.
