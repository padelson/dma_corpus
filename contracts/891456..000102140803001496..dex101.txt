                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") dated February 2,
2003, by and among Plains Exploration & Production Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), PXP Gulf Coast Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub," and, together with Parent, the
"Parent Parties") and 3TEC Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Target").

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent Parties and
Target deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders that Target merge with and into Merger Sub (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and
such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger; and

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) with the approval of Target's Board of Directors, Parent has
entered into voting agreements with each of EnCap Energy Capital Fund III, L.P.,
EnCap Energy Acquisition III-B, Inc., BOCP Energy Partners, L.P., ECIC
Corporation, Floyd C. Wilson, R. A. Walker, and Stephen W. Herod under which
such parties have among other things agreed to support the Merger upon the terms
and conditions set forth therein, and (ii) with the approval of Parent's Board
of Directors, Target has entered into voting agreements with each of EnCap
Energy Capital Fund III, L.P., EnCap Energy Capital Fund III-B, L.P., BOCP
Energy Partners, L.P., Energy Capital Investment Company PLC, Sable Management,
L.P., and James C. Flores, under which such parties have among other things
agreed to support the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein
(collectively, the "Voting Agreements"); and

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at
the Effective Time Target shall merge with and into Merger Sub and the separate
corporate existence of Target shall thereupon cease and Merger Sub shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation") as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), including the Surviving Corporation's succession
to and assumption of all rights and obligations of Merger Sub and Target

         1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
(the "Effective Time") upon the later of (i) the date of filing of a properly
executed Certificate of Merger relating to the Merger with the Secretary of
State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, and (ii) at such later time as
the parties shall agree and set forth in such Certificate of Merger. The

                                       1

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

         3.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital
stock described below:

             (a) All shares of Common Stock of Target, par value $.02 ("Target
Common Shares"), that are held in Target's treasury shall be canceled and cease
to exist and no cash, Parent capital stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

             (b) Conversion of Target Common Shares.

                 (i) Subject to Sections 3.4 and 3.5, each issued and
             outstanding Target Common Share (other than Target Common Shares
             treated in accordance with Section 3.1(a) or Dissenting Shares)
             shall be converted into the right to receive (x) $8.50 in cash

             Consideration") and (y) the number of shares of common stock, par

             to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration" and, together with
             the Cash Consideration, the "Common Conversion Consideration"). All
             such Target Common Shares, when so converted, shall be retired,
             shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically

                                       2

<PAGE>

             be cancelled, and the holder of a certificate ("Common Stock
             Certificate") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time
             represented such Target Common Shares shall cease to have any
             rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
             surrender of such Common Stock Certificate in accordance with
             Section 3.2: (A) the Common Conversion Consideration, (B) certain
             dividends and other distributions under Section 3.1(f), and (C)
             cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares under Section 3.4
             (the "de minimis Shares"), in each case without interest
             (collectively, the "Common Stock Merger Consideration").
             Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date hereof and the
             Effective Time the Parent Common Shares or Target Common Shares are
             changed into a different number of shares or a different class,
             because of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
             recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the
             Exchange Ratio and, with respect to the changes in the outstanding
             Target Common Shares, the Cash Consideration, shall be
             correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
             subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
             or exchange of shares.

                 (ii)  If the Market Price is less than the Minimum Market
             Price, Parent may either terminate this Agreement under Section
             10.1(i) or pay the Additional Cash under Section 3.1(b)(i).

                 (iii) Additional Definitions

                 "Additional Cash" means an amount in cash equal to the product
             of (i) the Minimum Market Price minus the Market Price and (ii) the
             Exchange Ratio.

                 "Exchange Ratio" means 0.85 provided that if the Market Price
             of the Parent Common Shares is:

                       .  greater than $12.35, then the Exchange Ratio shall
                 equal the quotient of (A) $10.50 divided by (B) the Market
                 Price.

                       .  less than $7.65, then the Exchange Ratio shall equal
                 the quotient of (A) $6.50 divided by (B) the Market Price. If
                 the Market Price, is less than the Minimum Market Price the
                 Market Price in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be
                 the Minimum Market Price.

                 "Market Price" means the average of the closing prices of a
             Parent Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in
             The Wall Street Journal, for the 20 consecutive trading days
             immediately preceding the third trading day before the Closing.

                 "Minimum Market Price" means $6.25.

             (c) Each share of Series D Preferred Stock of Target, par value
$.02 per share (the "Target D Preferred Shares"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than those Target D Preferred
Shares held by a Dissenting Stockholder, shall be converted into the right to
receive the amount of cash that would be required to redeem such

                                       3

<PAGE>

share pursuant to the Certificate of Designation filed with the Secretary of
State of Delaware with respect thereto as of the Effective Time (the "Preferred
Conversion Consideration"). All such Target D Preferred Shares, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and the holder of a certificate ("Preferred Stock
Certificate" and, together with the Common Stock Certificates, the "Stock
Certificates") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding Target D Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Preferred Stock
Certificate, the Preferred Conversion Consideration without interest
(collectively, the "Preferred Stock Merger Consideration," and, together with
the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

             (d) The Merger shall not affect any common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which will remain outstanding and which will represent all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

             (e) The Merger shall not affect any Parent Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

             (f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any un-surrendered Common Stock Certificate with respect to the
applicable Common Stock Merger Consideration represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Common Stock Certificate has surrendered such Common
Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws (including escheat and abandoned property laws), following
surrender of any such Common Stock Certificate, the record holder of the
certificate or certificates representing the Common Stock Merger Consideration
issued in exchange therefor shall be paid without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to Common Stock Merger Consideration, and (ii)
if the payment date for any dividend or distribution payable with respect to
Common Stock Merger Consideration has not occurred prior to the surrender of
such Common Stock Certificate, at the appropriate payment date therefor, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Common Stock Certificate and a
payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Common Stock Certificate.

             (g) All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock Certificates
and the Target Common Shares or Target D Preferred Shares formerly represented
thereby, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Target Common Shares, or Target D Preferred Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

       3.2    Surrender and Payment.

              (a) Parent shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s)
reasonably acceptable to Target to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the
"Exchange Agent") with respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Target Common Shares and Target D Preferred Shares, for exchange in accordance
with this Section 3.2 through the Exchange Agent, the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver
the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by Section 3.2(d), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

              (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of Stock Certificates a letter
of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to the Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Target), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock
Certificates for payment therefor in accordance herewith (together, the
"Exchange Instructions").

              (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the registered holder of Target Common Shares or Target D
Preferred Shares, as applicable, represented by the Stock Certificate(s)
surrendered in exchange therefor, no such issuance or payment shall be made
unless (i) the Stock Certificate(s) so surrendered have been properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
issuance has paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as
a result of such issuance to a Person other than the registered holder or
establish to the Exchange Agent's satisfaction that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. For this Agreement, "Person" means an individual, a corporation,
a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other
entity or organization, including any governmental or regulatory authority or
agency (a "Governmental Authority").

              (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Target Common Shares or Target D Preferred Shares one year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not exchanged such holder's Stock Certificates in accordance with this
Section 3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, as a
general creditor thereof, to exchange such Stock Certificates or to pay amounts
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. If outstanding Stock
Certificates are not surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time
(or, in any particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Stock Certificates
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency), the Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of such
Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Target or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of

                                       5

<PAGE>

Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration delivered, to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

             (e) If any Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

       3.3   Stock Options; Warrants; Restricted Stock.

             (a) Target Options.

                 (i)  Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall cause all stock
             options ("Target Stock Options") issued pursuant to the Target
             Benefit Plans listed on Section 4.11(a)(1) of the Target Disclosure
             Schedule to be vested and shall cause such holders to exercise such
             Target Stock Options prior to the Effective Time for consideration
             equal to that number of Target Common Shares equal to the quotient
             of (X) the difference between (1) the product of (I) $17.00 times
             (II) the number of Target Common Shares issuable upon exercise of
             such Target Stock Option minus (2) the aggregate exercise price of
             such Stock Option divided by (Y) $17.00, and if such Target Stock
             Options are not exercised prior to the Effective Time, such options
             shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

                 (ii) Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
             Board of Directors or any committee thereof responsible for the
             administration of Target's option plans to take any and all action
             necessary to effectuate the matters described in this Section
             3.3(a) on or before the Effective Time.

             (b) Target Warrants. Target shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause each warrant to purchase Target Common Shares for $3.00 per share
listed on Section 3.3(b)(i) of the Target Disclosure Schedule to be
automatically exchanged for consideration equal to that Common Stock Merger
Consideration that would have been received by the holder of such warrant had
such warrant been exercised prior to the Effective Time and as a result of such
exercise such holder received Target Common shares equal to the quotient of (X)
the difference between (1) the product of (I) $17.00 times (II) the number of
Target Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such warrant minus (2) the
aggregate exercise price of such warrant divided by (Y) $17.00 (the "$3.00
Warrant Consideration").

             (c) Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, all remaining
restrictions with respect to the Target Restricted Stock shall expire and the
Target Restricted Stock shall be treated as Target Common Shares in accordance
with Section 3.1(b). "Target Restricted Stock" means the shares of Target
restricted stock issued pursuant to the Target Benefit Plans.

             (d) Taxes and Interest. Any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 3.3 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be
paid without interest.

                                       6

<PAGE>

       3.4 No Fractional Shares. No de minimis Shares shall be issued in the
Merger and fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. All holders of de minimis
Shares shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash equal to
such fraction times twice the Cash Consideration (but one times the Additional
Cash).

       3.5 Dissenter's Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the
contrary, Target Common Shares and Target D Preferred Shares, if any, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand for
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 the DGCL (a "Dissenting
Stockholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock
Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable,
as provided in Section 3.1, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal under
the DGCL. A Dissenting Stockholder may receive payment of the fair value of the
Target Common Shares or the Target D Preferred Shares, as applicable, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by such Dissenting
Stockholder ("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL,
provided that such Dissenting Stockholder complies with Section 262 of the DGCL.
At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to
exist and shall represent only the right to receive the fair value thereof in
accordance with the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such
Dissenting Stockholder's right to appraisal, such Dissenting Stockholder's
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted, as
of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable. Target
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other instruments served under the
DGCL, and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations,
proceedings or settlements with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.
Target shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any appraisal
demands for appraisal and shall not, except with Parent's prior written consent,
settle or offer to settle any such demands.

       3.6 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Transactions") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the business day (the "Closing Date") on which all of the conditions
set forth in Article VIII are satisfied or waived, at the offices of Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, 1900 Pennzoil Place, South Tower, 711 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas 77002, or at such other date and time as Parent and
Target shall agree.

Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither Target nor any Target ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in, and Target and each Target ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge
of any Person that has engaged in, any transaction in violation of Section
406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption exists
under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of
the Code that could reasonably be expected to result in a Target Material

respective times such documents are filed, and, in the case of the
Proxy/Prospectus, at the time the Proxy/Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to the Target stockholders, at the time of
the Target Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting and at the Effective
Time, and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be made therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

      4.21   Intellectual Property. Target owns, or licenses or otherwise has
the right to use, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, rights, trade names,
trade name rights, service marks, service mark rights, copyrights, technology,
know-how, processes and other proprietary intellectual property rights and
computer programs ("Intellectual Property") currently used in the conduct of the
business of Target, except where the failure to so own or otherwise have the
right to use such Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Target Material Adverse Effect. No Person has notified Target
that its use of such Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any
Person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or in
the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of Target that could have
a Target Material Adverse Effect, and, to Target's knowledge, no Person is
infringing on any right of Target with respect to any such Intellectual
Property. No claims are pending or, to Target's knowledge, threatened that
Target is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any Person
with regard to any Intellectual Property.

      4.22   Hedging. Section 4.22 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth
for the periods shown obligations of Target for the delivery of Hydrocarbons
attributable to any of the properties of Target in the future on account of
prepayment, advance payment, take-or-pay or similar obligations without then or
thereafter being entitled to receive full value therefor. Except as set forth in
Section 4.22 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, Target is
not bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap, option or
other contracts that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or
eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the price of commodities, including
Hydrocarbons, or securities.

      4.23   Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Credit
Suisse First Boston LLC or Bear Stearns, the fees and expenses of which will be
paid by Target) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's fee or other fee or
commission payable by Target in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by and on behalf of Target. True and correct copies of all
agreements and engagement letters currently in effect with Credit Suisse First
Boston LLC or Bear Stearns (the "Target Engagement Letters") have been provided
to Parent.

      4.24   Tax-Free Reorganization. Neither Target nor, to the knowledge of
Target, any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

             (a) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreement, and there are no other written or oral
agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in this
Agreement.

             (b) The fair market value of Parent Common Shares and cash received
by each holder of Target Common Shares in connection with the Merger will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Target Common
Shares surrendered in the exchange.

             (c) To the best knowledge of Target, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
nor any Related Person (defined below) has any plan or intention to redeem or
otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly, any Parent Common Shares to be
issued in the Merger.

             (d) To the best knowledge of Target, the aggregate fair market
value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares to be
received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of the value,
determined at the Effective Time, of Target Common Shares and any warrants to
purchase Target Common Shares ("Target Warrants") outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time. For this purpose, it is assumed that the fair market value
of the outstanding Target Common Shares and Target Warrants will equal the fair
market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

             (e) Prior to the Effective Time and in connection with or
anticipation of the Merger, (i) none of the Target Common Shares will be
redeemed, (ii) no extraordinary distribution will be made with respect to Target
Common Shares, and (iii) none of the Target Common Shares will be acquired by
Target or any Related Person.

             (f) Target will redeem its outstanding Series D Preferred Stock
immediately before the Merger solely with Target's funds. Parent will provide no
funds to Target, directly or indirectly, for Target to redeem such Series D
Preferred Stock or for Target to repay debt incurred to redeem such stock.

             (g) The only capital stock of Target issued and outstanding is
Target Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock.

             (h) Target and Target stockholders will each pay their respective
expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.

             (i) Any compensation paid to the Target stockholders who enter (or
have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive contracts, if any,
with Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation (a) will be for services
actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be commensurate with amounts paid
to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services, and (c) will
not represent consideration for the surrender of the Target Common Shares in the
Merger.

                                       20

<PAGE>

          (j) No debt of Target is guaranteed by any Target stockholder.

          (k) Target owns no stock of Parent.

          (l) Merger Sub will acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair
market value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the gross
assets held by Target immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this
representation, amounts paid by Target to dissenters, amounts paid by Target to
stockholders who receive cash or other property, Target assets used to pay its
reorganization expenses, and all redemptions and distributions (including the
redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock, but excluding regular, normal
dividends) made by Target immediately preceding the transfer, will be included
in assets of Target held immediately prior to the Merger.

          (m) No assets of Target have been sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of which would prevent Parent from continuing the historic business of
Target or from using a significant portion of Target's historic business assets
in a business following the Merger. Target intends to continue its historic
business or use a significant portion of its historic business assets in a
business.

          (n) Target is not an investment company as defined in Section
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is (a) a regulated investment
company; (b) a real estate investment trust; or (c) a corporation (i) fifty
percent (50%) or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and
securities, and (ii) eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total
assets are held for investment. For this purpose, "total assets" shall not
include cash and cash items (including receivables) and government securities.

          (o) The fair market value of the assets of Target transferred to
Merger Sub in the Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed
or paid by Parent or Merger Sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which the transferred assets are subject.

          (p) The total adjusted basis of the assets of Target transferred to
Merger Sub in the Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed
or paid by Parent or Merger Sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which the transferred assets are subject.

          (q) Target is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

          (r) There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent
and Target, or between Merger Sub and Target, that was or will be issued,
acquired, or settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

          (s) Target has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for
the Merger, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arm's length
negotiations.

          (t) Target will not take, and Target is not aware of any plan or
intention of any of the Target stockholders to take, any position on any
federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax
reporting position, that is inconsistent with the

                                       21

<PAGE>

treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Code
Section 1313(a)(1)).

          (u) No stock or securities of Target, or to the knowledge of Target,
no stock or securities of Parent, will be issued to any Target stockholder for
services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub, or Target in
connection with the Merger.

          (v) No stock or securities of Parent or of Target will be issued to
any Target stockholder for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder in
connection with the Merger.

          (w) The liabilities of Target to be assumed or paid by Parent and
Merger Sub and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of Target are
subject were incurred by Target in the ordinary course of its business.

          (x) No assets were transferred to Target, nor did Target assume any
liabilities, in anticipation of the Merger.

          (y) The undersigned officer is authorized to make all of the
certifications and representations set forth herein.

          For purposes of this section, a "Related Person" with respect to
either Parent or Merger Sub shall mean

          (i) a corporation that, immediately before or immediately after a
purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition of Parent Common Stock, is
a member of an Affiliated Group (as defined herein) of which Parent (or any
successor corporation) is a member, or

          (ii) a corporation in which Parent (or any successor corporation),
owns, or which owns with respect to Parent (or any successor corporation),
directly or indirectly, immediately before or immediately after such purchase,
exchange, redemption, or other acquisition, at least 50% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50% of the
total value of shares of all classes of stock, taking into account for purposes
of this clause (ii) any stock owned by 5% or greater stockholders of Parent (or
any successor) or such corporation, a proportionate share of the stock owned by
entities in which Parent (or any successor) or such corporation owns an
interest, and any stock which may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of
options.

          For purposes of this section, "Affiliated Group" shall mean one or
more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with a common
parent corporation, but only if

          (x) the common parent owns directly stock that possesses at least 80%
of the total voting power, and has a value at least equal to 80% of the total
value, of the stock in at least one of the other corporations, and

          (y) stock possessing at least 80% of the total voting power, and
having a value at least equal to 80% of the total value, of the stock in each
corporation (except the common parent) is owned directly by one or more of the
other corporations.

                                       22

<PAGE>

     For purposes of the preceding sentence, "stock" does not include any stock
that (a) is not entitled to vote, (b) is limited and preferred as to dividends
and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent, (c) has
redemption and liquidation rights that do not exceed the issue price of such
stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium), and (d) is
not convertible into another class of stock.

     4.25 Fairness Opinion. Target's Board of Directors has received a written
opinion from each of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and Bear Stearns to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinions, the Common Conversion
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
Target Common Shares. True and complete copies of such opinion have been given
to Parent.

     4.26 Takeover Laws. Target and Target's Board of Directors have each taken
all actions necessary to be taken such that no restrictive provision of any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "interested
shareholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination," or other similar
anti-takeover statutes, laws or regulations of any state, including the State of
Delaware and Section 203 of the DGCL, or any applicable anti-takeover provision
in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Target, is, or at the
Effective Time will be, applicable to Target, Parent, Merger Sub, Target Common
Shares or Target D Preferred Shares, the Voting Agreements, this Agreement or
the Transactions.

                                   ARTICLE V

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

     Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Target as follows:

     5.1  Organization and Qualification.

          (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in the jurisdictions set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the disclosure
letter delivered by Parent to Target contemporaneously with the execution hereof
(the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), which include each jurisdiction in which the
character of Parent's or Merger Sub's properties or the nature of its business
makes such qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions, if any, where the
failure to be so qualified would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). Each Parent Party has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, use or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Each Parent Party has made available to Target a
complete and correct copy of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each
as amended to date, and Parent's and Merger Sub's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws as so delivered are in full force and effect. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is in default in any respect in the performance, observation or
fulfillment of any provision of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent formed solely for the
purpose of effecting the Merger and has conducted no activity and has incurred
no liability or obligation other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

                                       23

<PAGE>

          (b) Section 5.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists the name
and jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger
Sub) and the jurisdictions in which each such Subsidiary is qualified or holds
licenses to do business as a foreign corporation or other organization as of the
date hereof. Each of Parent's Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in the jurisdictions listed in Section 5.1(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, which includes each jurisdiction in which the character of
such Subsidiary's properties or the nature of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions, if any, where the failure to
be so qualified would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent's Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
use or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and as it is now proposed to be conducted. Parent has made available
to Target a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of Parent's Subsidiaries,
each as amended to date, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) as so delivered are in full force and effect.
No Subsidiary of Parent is in default in any respect in the performance,
observation or fulfillment of any provision of its certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or similar organizational documents). Other than Parent's
Subsidiaries, Parent does not beneficially own or control, directly or
indirectly, 5% or more of any class of equity or similar securities of any
corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated.

          (c) For this Agreement, a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any
event, circumstance, condition, development or occurrence causing, resulting in
or having (or with the passage of time likely to cause, result in or have) a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets,
properties, prospects or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided that, in no event shall any of the following be
deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: any event, circumstance, change or effect that results from (i)
changes affecting the economy generally, (ii) changes in the market price of oil
or natural gas, (iii) the public announcement or pending nature of the
Transactions, (iv) compliance with the terms of this Agreement, or (v) change in
the price of the Target Common Shares or the Parent Common Shares.

     5.2  Capitalization.

          (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 100,000,000
Parent Common Shares, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock of Parent, par
value $.01 per share. As of the date hereof, Parent has (i) 24,224,448 Parent
Common Shares issued and outstanding, (ii) no Parent Common Shares in treasury,
(iii) no shares of preferred stock outstanding (iv) no outstanding stock options
to acquire Parent Common Shares under any stock option plans or agreements of
Parent, and (v) no more than 4,023,834 stock appreciation rights of Parent. All
the outstanding Parent Common Shares are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth above, and
other than this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
rights, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights, phantom
equity, or other agreements or commitments (including "rights plans" or "poison
pills") obligating Parent to issue, transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase or
otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock of any class. Except as
contemplated by the Voting Agreement, there

                                       24

<PAGE>

are no agreements, arrangements or other understandings with respect to the
right to vote any shares of capital stock of Parent.

          (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.2(b) Parent Disclosure Letter,
Parent is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Parent Subsidiary, there are no
irrevocable proxies with respect to any such shares, and no equity securities of
any Parent Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued because of any
options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for, shares of any capital stock of any Parent Subsidiary, and
there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or may be bound to issue additional shares of
capital stock of any Parent Subsidiary or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any such shares. Except as set forth in Section
5.2(b) to the Parent Disclosure Schedule, all of such shares so owned by Parent
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by it free and
clear of all Liens.

     5.3  Authority. Each of Parent and, solely with respect to this Agreement,
Merger Sub, has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party and,
subject to obtaining the Parent Share Issuance Approval to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by each Parent Party's
Board of Directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either
Parent Party are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements to which any of them are or will be a party or to consummate the
Transactions, other than the Parent Share Issuance Approval. This Agreement has
been, and the Ancillary Agreements to which Parent or Merger Sub is or will be a
party are, or upon execution will be, duly and validly executed and delivered by
each Parent Party and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof and thereof by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes or upon
execution will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each Parent Party
enforceable against such Persons in accordance with their respective terms,
except for the Enforceability Exception.

     5.4  Consents and Approvals; No Violation. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the Transactions and the performance by each
Parent Party of its obligations hereunder will not:

          (a) subject to obtaining the Parent Share Issuance Approval, conflict
with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as amended, of
Parent or the certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of any of its Subsidiaries;

          (b) subject to obtaining the Parent Share Issuance Approval and the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware,
require any consent, waiver, approval, order, authorization or permit of, or
registration, filing with or notification to, (i) any Governmental Authority,
except for applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,

5.4(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, any third party other than a

termination, cancellation or acceleration or guaranteed payments or a loss of a
material benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,

this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (iii) prevent the consummation of
any of the Transactions;

          (d) violate the provisions of any order, writ, injunction, judgment,

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets is bound;

other document (including exhibits and amendments thereto), filed with the SEC
since November 8, 2002 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act

SEC Reports were filed or, if any such Parent SEC Reports were amended, as of
the date such amendment was filed, each Parent SEC Report, including any
financial statements or schedules included therein, (a) complied in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (b) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No event since the date of the last Parent SEC
Report has occurred that would require Parent to file a Current Report on Form
8-K other than the execution of this Agreement.

     5.6  Parent Financial Statements. Each of the audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of
Parent (including any

                                       26

<PAGE>

related notes and schedules) included (or incorporated by reference) in its
Report on Form 10 made effective on December 6, 2002 have been prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject,
in the case of quarterly financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments) and fairly present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows (and changes in financial
position, if any) of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods presented
therein (subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of financial
footnotes in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

     5.7  Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. As of the date hereof, except (a)
as specifically disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed and publicly available
prior to the date hereof and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice since December 31,
2001, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (contingent or otherwise) that would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.8  Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof, as set forth in

Agreement, since December 31, 2001 (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, (b) there has not been any change or
development, or combination of changes or developments that, individually or in
the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (c) there has not
been any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of Parent, or any
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of, or other
ownership interests in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (d) there has not
been any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, and (e) there has not been any change in any method of
accounting or accounting practice by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except
for any such change required because of a concurrent change in GAAP or to
conform a Subsidiary's accounting policies and practices to those of Parent.

     5.9  Taxes. Except as otherwise disclosed in Section 5.9 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect:

          (a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or have had
timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause to be timely filed, all
material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be filed by any of them prior
to or as of the Closing Date. As of the time of filing, the foregoing Tax
Returns correctly reflected the facts regarding the income, business, assets,
operations, activities, status, or other matters of Parent or any other
information required to be shown thereon. An extension of time within which to
file a Tax Return that has not been filed has not been requested or granted.

                                       27

<PAGE>

          (b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or have had paid on
their behalf), or where payment is not yet due, have established (or have had
established on their behalf and for their sole benefit and recourse), or will
establish or cause to be established on or before the Closing Date, an adequate
accrual for the payment of all material Taxes (as defined below) due with
respect to any period ending prior to or as of the Closing Date.

          (c) No Audit by a Tax Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened with respect to any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from,
Parent or any Subsidiary. No issue has been raised by any Tax Authority in any
Audit of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that if raised with respect to any
other period not so audited could be expected to result in a material proposed
deficiency for any period not so audited. No material deficiency or adjustment
for any Taxes has been proposed, asserted, assessed, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no liens
for Taxes upon the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except liens for
current Taxes not yet delinquent.

          (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has given or been
requested to give any waiver of statutes of limitations relating to the payment
of Taxes or have executed powers of attorney with respect to Tax matters, which
will be outstanding as of the Closing Date.

          (e) Prior to the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have

or any of its Subsidiaries are a party to, is bound by, or has any obligation or
liability for Taxes.

          (f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has given or been
requested to give any waiver of statutes of limitations relating to the payment

will be outstanding as of the Closing Date.

          (g) Prior to the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have
disclosed, and provided or made available true and complete copies to Target of,

          (h) Except as set forth in Section 5.9(h) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, and except for the group of which Parent is currently a member and any

Code.

          (i) Parent has not agreed to make nor is it required to make any
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of change in accounting
method or otherwise.

          (j) After consultation with counsel, Parent is aware of no facts which
would prevent its counsel from rendering the opinion set forth in Section 8.1(f)

     5.10 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed and
publicly available prior to the date hereof or Section 5.10 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened against or directly

                                       28

affecting Parent, any Subsidiaries of Parent or any of the directors or officers
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacity as such, nor is there any
reasonable basis therefor that could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, if adversely determined. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any order,
judgment or decree of any court or any other Governmental Authority from
engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the
business, assets or properties of Parent or such Subsidiary, nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is Parent, any Subsidiary or any officer, director or
employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries under investigation by any Governmental
Authority. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof or Section 5.10 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, there is no order, judgment or decree of any court or other tribunal
or other agency extant enjoining or requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to take any action of any kind with respect to its business, assets or
properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this
Section 5.10 is made with respect to Environmental Laws, which are covered
exclusively by the provisions set forth in Section 5.12.

     5.11 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

          (a) Section 5.11(a)(1) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a
true and complete list of the individual or group employee benefit plans or
arrangements of any type (including plans described in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, which together with Parent would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code
or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate") within six years
prior to the Effective Time ("Parent Benefit Plans"), and Schedule 5.11(a)(2) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists each individual employment, severance or
similar agreement with respect to which Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate has
any current or future obligation or liability.

          (b) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan: (i) if intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, such plan satisfies the
requirements of such sections, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its qualification, and its
related trust has been determined to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of
the Code and, to the knowledge of Parent, nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter to adversely affect such qualification or exemption; (ii) each such
plan has been administered in substantial compliance with its terms and
applicable law, except for any noncompliance with respect to any such plan that
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
(iii) neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and Parent
and each Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person that has
engaged in, any transaction or acted or failed to act in any manner that would
subject Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to any liability for a breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iv) no disputes are pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither
Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and Parent and each Parent
ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any
transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section
4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of the

                                       29

<PAGE>

Code that could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; (vi) there have been no "reportable events" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day notice requirement of ERISA has not
been waived by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"); (vii) all
contributions due have been made on a timely basis (within, where applicable,
the time limit established under Section 302 of ERISA or Code Section 412);
(viii) no notice of intent to terminate such plan has been given under Section
4041 of ERISA and no proceeding has been instituted under Section 4042 of ERISA
to terminate such plan; and (ix) except for defined benefit plans (if
applicable), such plan may be terminated on a prospective basis without any
continuing liability for benefits other than benefits accrued to the date of
such termination. All contributions made or required to be made under any Parent
Benefit Plan meet the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all
contributions which are required and which have not been made have been properly
recorded on the books of Parent or a Parent ERISA Affiliate.

          (c) No Parent Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning
of Section 413(c) of the Code). No event has occurred with respect to Parent or
a Parent ERISA Affiliate in connection with which Parent could be subject to any
liability, lien or encumbrance with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan described in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained, sponsored
or contributed to by a Parent ERISA Affiliate under ERISA or the Code, except
for regular contributions and benefit payments in the ordinary course of plan
business.

          (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.11(d) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, no present or former employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
are covered by any employee agreements or plans that provide or will provide
severance pay, post-termination health or life insurance benefits (except as
required pursuant to Section 4980(B) of the Code) or any similar benefits, and
the consummation of the Transactions shall not cause any payments or benefits to
any employee to be either subject to an excise tax or non-deductible to Parent
under Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, respectively.

     5.12 Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in Section 5.12 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or as could not reasonably be expected to result in
liabilities that have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

          (a) The businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been and are
operated in material compliance with all Environmental Laws.

          (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has caused or allowed
the generation, treatment, manufacture, processing, distribution, use, storage,
discharge, release, disposal, transport or handling of any Hazardous Substances,
except in material compliance with all Environmental Laws, and, to Parent's
knowledge, no generation, treatment, manufacture, processing, distribution, use,
storage, discharge, release, disposal, transport or handling of any Hazardous
Substances has occurred at any property or facility owned, leased or operated by
Parent for any of its Subsidiaries except in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws.

                                       30

<PAGE>

             (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Authority or third party or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other communication alleging or concerning any material
violation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of, or responsibility or
liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Environmental Law.
There are no pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, claims, suits,
actions, proceedings or investigations with respect to the businesses or
operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries alleging or concerning any
material violation of, or responsibility or liability under, any Environmental
Law, nor does Parent have any knowledge of any fact or condition that could give
rise to such a claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation.

             (d) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and are in
compliance with all material approvals, permits, licenses, registrations and
similar authorizations from all Governmental Authorities under all Environmental
Laws required for the operation of the businesses of Parent and its
Subsidiaries; there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
actions, proceedings or investigations alleging violations of or seeking to
modify, revoke or deny renewal of any of such approvals, permits, licenses,
registrations and authorizations; and Parent does not have knowledge of any fact
or condition that is reasonably likely to give rise to any action, proceeding or
investigation regarding the violation of or seeking to modify, revoke or deny
renewal of any of such approvals, permits, licenses, registrations and
authorizations.

             (e) Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) to Parent's knowledge, all offsite locations where Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has transported, released, discharged, stored, disposed or arranged
for the disposal of Hazardous Substances are licensed and operating as required
by law and (ii) no PCBs, PCB-containing items, asbestos-containing materials, or
radioactive materials are used or stored at any property owned, leased or
operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except in material compliance with
Environmental Laws.

             (f) No claims have been asserted or, to Parent's knowledge,
threatened to be asserted against Parent or its Subsidiaries for any personal
injury (including wrongful death) or property damage (real or personal) arising
out of alleged exposure or otherwise related to Hazardous Substances used,
handled, generated, transported or disposed by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

      5.13   Compliance with Laws and Parent Material Contracts. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or in default under, and no
event has occurred that (with notice or the lapse of time or both) would
constitute a violation of or default under, (a) its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, or other governing document, (b) any applicable law,
rule, regulation, order, writ, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority,
or (c) any Parent Material Contract, except (in the case of clause (b) or (c)
above) for any violation or default that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to Parent is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, other than those the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Parent, no party to any Parent Material Contract is in material
breach of the terms, provisions and conditions of such Parent Material Contract.
"Parent Material Contract" means any written or oral agreements, contracts,
commitments or understandings to which Parent is a party, by which Parent is
directly

                                       31

<PAGE>

or indirectly bound, or to which any asset of Parent may be subject, involving
total value or consideration in excess of $1,000,000.

      5.14   Insurance. Section 5.14 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists
each insurance policy relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries currently in
effect. Parent has made available to Target a true, complete and correct copy of
each such policy or the binder therefor. With respect to each such insurance
policy or binder none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party to
the policy is in breach or default thereunder (including with respect to the
payment of premiums or the giving of notices), and Parent does not know of any
occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or both) would
constitute such a breach or default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration under the policy, except for such breaches or defaults which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Section 5.14 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule describes any
self-insurance arrangements affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries.

affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and, during the past five years,
there has not been any such action, (ii) none of Parent or any of its

health, and are not engaged in any unfair labor practices as defined in the
National Labor Relations Act or other applicable law, ordinance or regulation,
(v) there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against any of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
before the National Labor Relations Board or any similar state or foreign
agency, (vi) there is no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of any
collective bargaining agreement or other grievance procedure relating to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, (vii) neither the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration nor any other federal or state agency has threatened to file any

Subsidiaries, and (viii) there is no employee or governmental claim or
investigation, including any charges to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or state employment practice agency, investigations regarding Fair
Labor Standards Act compliance, audits by the Office of Federal Contractor
Compliance Programs, Workers' Compensation claims, sexual harassment complaints
or demand letters or threatened claims.

             (b) Since the enactment of the WARN Act, none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN
Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating
units within any site of employment or

                                       32

<PAGE>

facility of any of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) a "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or facility of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
been affected by any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any similar state or
local law, in each case that could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

      5.16   Reserve Reports.

             (a) All information (excluding assumptions and estimates but
including the statement of the percentage of reserves from the oil and gas wells
and other interests evaluated therein to which Parent is entitled and the
percentage of the costs and expenses related to such wells or interests to be
borne by Parent) supplied to Ryder Scott Company, L.P. and Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. by or on behalf of Parent that was material to such firm's

Interests (as hereinafter defined) of Parent in connection with the preparation
of the proved oil and gas reserve reports concerning the Oil and Gas Interests
of Parent as of December 31, 2002 and prepared by such engineering firm (the
"Parent Reserve Report") was (at the time supplied or as modified or amended
prior to the issuance of the Parent Reserve Report) to Parent's knowledge
accurate in all material respects and Parent has no knowledge of any material
errors in such information that existed at the time of such issuance.

             (b) Set forth in Section 5.16(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule

Customary Post Closing Consents, Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all of the
Permits required or necessary to construct, own, operate, use and/or maintain
its properties and conduct its operations as presently conducted, except for
such Permits, the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this Section 5.17 is made with
respect to Permits issued pursuant to Environmental Laws, which are covered
exclusively in Section 5.12.

      5.18   Required Stockholder Vote or Consent. The only vote or written
consent of the holders of any class or series of Parent's capital stock that
shall be necessary to consummate the Transactions is the approval by a majority

(the "Parent Share Issuance Approval").

      5.19   Proxy/Prospectus; Registration Statement. None of the information
to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in (a) the Proxy/Prospectus to be filed
by Target and Parent with the SEC, and any amendments or supplements thereto, or

Proxy/Prospectus, at the time the Proxy/Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to the Target and Parent stockholders, at the

<PAGE>

Statement, when it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be made therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

      5.20   Intellectual Property. Parent or its Subsidiaries own, or are
licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property currently
used in the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, except where
the failure to so own or otherwise have the right to use such Intellectual
Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. No Person has notified either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that their use of the Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any
Person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or in
the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that could have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and, to Parent's
knowledge, no Person is infringing on any right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are
pending or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any
Person with regard to any Intellectual Property.

      5.21   Hedging. Section 5.21 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth
for the periods shown obligations of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries for the
delivery of Hydrocarbons attributable to any of the properties of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in the future on account of prepayment, advance payment,
take-or-pay or similar obligations without then or thereafter being entitled to
receive full value therefor. Except as set forth in Section 5.21 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap,
option or other contracts that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce
or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the price of commodities, including
Hydrocarbons, or securities.

      5.22   Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Lehman
Brothers Inc. the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent) is entitled
to any brokerage, finder's fee or other fee or commission payable by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. True
and correct copies of all agreements and engagement letters currently in effect
with Lehman Brothers Inc. (the "Parent Engagement Letters") have been provided
to Target.

      5.23   Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any of
its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the
Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

             (a) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and there are no other written or oral
agreements relating to the Merger other than those expressly referred to in this
Agreement.

             (b) In connection with the Merger, no Target Common Shares will be
acquired by Parent or a Related Person for consideration other than Parent
Common Shares,

                                       34

<PAGE>

except for the Cash Consideration, payments to the dissenting stockholders, if
any, and any cash received in lieu of fractional share interests in Parent
Common Shares.

             (c) The fair market value of Parent Common Shares and cash received
by each holder of Target Common Shares in connection with the Merger will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the Target Common Shares
surrendered in the exchange.

             (d) Parent will provide no funds to Target, directly or indirectly,
for Target to redeem its Series D Preferred Stock or for Target to repay debt
incurred to redeem such stock.

             (e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any Related Person as
defined in Attachment A) has any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise
reacquire, directly or indirectly, any Parent Common Shares to be issued in the
Merger.

             (f) Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan
or intention to adopt such a plan.

             (g) To the best knowledge of Parent, the aggregate fair market
value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares to be
received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of the value,
determined at the Effective Time, of the Target Common Shares and Target
Warrants outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. For this purpose, it
is assumed that the fair market value of the outstanding Target Common Shares
and Target Warrants will equal the fair market value of the aggregate Merger
Consideration.

             (h) Neither Parent nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned
during the past five years, any shares of stock of the Target. Neither Parent
nor any Related Person has caused any other person to acquire stock of the
Target on behalf of Parent or a Related Person, and will not directly or
indirectly acquire any stock of the Target in connection with the Merger, except
as described in the Merger Agreement.

             (i) Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or
property to the Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Target) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made any loan
to the Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Target) in
anticipation of the Merger.

             (j) There is no intercompany indebtedness existing between Parent
and Target, or between Merger Sub and Target, that was or will be issued,
acquired, or settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

             (k) Parent will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with or
as part of the Merger or related transactions. Parent has not paid and will not
pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by
any holder of Target Common Shares in connection with or as part of the Merger
or any related transactions. Parent has not agreed to assume, nor will it
directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or
contingent, of any holder of Target Common Shares.

                                       35

             (l) Any compensation paid to the holders of Target Common Shares
who enter (or have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive
contracts, if any, with Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation (a)
will be for services actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be
commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for
similar services, and (c) will not represent consideration for the surrender of
the Target Common Shares in the Merger.

             (m) Merger Sub is wholly and directly owned by Parent and has been
newly formed solely to consummate the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will have no assets other than cash to satisfy capital requirements
under state law and has not, and will not, conduct any business activities or
other operations of any kind other than the issuance of its stock to Parent or
as otherwise expressly required by the Merger Agreement.

             (n) At the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger Sub will not have

right pursuant to which any person could acquire any stock in Merger Sub.

             (o) Merger Sub will acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the
fair market value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the
gross assets held by Target immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of
this representation, amounts paid by Target to dissenters, amounts paid by
Target to stockholders who receive cash or other property, Target assets used to
pay its reorganization expenses, and all redemptions and distributions
(including the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock, but excluding
regular, normal dividends) made by Target immediately preceding the transfer,
will be included in assets of Target held immediately prior to the Merger.

             (p) Following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will continue
the historic business of Target or use a significant portion of its assets in a
business, within the meaning of Treas. Reg.(S)1.368-1(d).

             (q) Parent has no plan or intention to liquidate the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger; to merge the Surviving Corporation with
another corporation; to sell or otherwise dispose of the stock of Merger Sub; or
to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of Target except for
dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers or successive
transfers to one or more corporations controlled (within the meaning of Section
368(c) of the Code) in each case by the transferor corporation.

             (r) Following the Merger, Parent has no plan or intention to cause
the Surviving Corporation to issue additional shares of its stock that would
result in Parent owning stock possessing less than eighty percent (80%) of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or less
than eighty percent (80%) of the total number of shares of all other classes of
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

             (s) Parent is paying no consideration for the Target stock other
than the Merger Consideration.

                                       36

<PAGE>

             (t)  To the best knowledge of Parent, any Target liabilities
assumed or paid by Parent or Merger Sub and the liabilities to which the
transferred assets of the Target are subject were incurred by the Target in the
ordinary course of its business.

             (u)  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an investment company within
the meaning of Sections 368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is (1) a

<PAGE>

make an unsolicited bona fide Target Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the
extent that (with respect to this Section 7.2 F only):

                    (A) such unsolicited bona fide proposal relating to a Target
               Acquisition Proposal is made by a third party that Target's Board
               of Directors determines in good faith has the good faith intent
               to proceed with negotiations to consider, and the financial and

                    (B) Target's Board of Directors determines in good faith
               after consultation with its independent legal counsel and
               financial advisor (taking into account among other things the

               or entering into discussions with, such Person, Target enters
               into a customary confidentiality agreement with such Person,

                    (D) contemporaneously with furnishing such information to,

               furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
               negotiations with, such Person,

                    (E) such Target Acquisition Proposal is not subject to any
               financing contingencies, and

                    (F) Target uses all reasonable efforts to keep Parent
               informed in all material respects of the status and terms of any
               such negotiations or discussions (including the identity of the
               Person with whom such negotiations or discussions are being held)
               and provides Parent copies of such written proposals and any
               amendments or revisions thereto or correspondence related
               thereto; provided, that Parent agrees to execute a
               confidentiality agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to it,

               subject to Parent's disclosure obligations arising under
               applicable law or securities exchange regulations.

<PAGE>

             (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of Target and its Subsidiaries (each an
"Indemnified Party"), who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or
is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, or investigative (a "proceeding") against all losses, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel and experts and judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with
the prior written consent of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld))
actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party because the
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to any act or omission existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time including any act or omission relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions (the "Indemnified Liabilities") to the full extent permitted
under Delaware law or the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws. If an Indemnified Party makes or asserts any claim for Indemnified
Liabilities, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL
shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that nothing
herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party. If any
claim or claims are brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), such Indemnified Party may select counsel
for the defense of such claim, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
Target (if selected before the Effective Time) and the Surviving Corporation (if
selected after the Effective Time).

             (b) The Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection with any such
action or proceeding described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to the receipt by the Surviving
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation.

             (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain Target's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy ("D&O Insurance") for a
period of at least six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent
related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar
coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former
directors or officers.

      7.4    Further Assurances. Each party shall use all reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents and approvals and to do all other things necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions. The parties shall take such further action to
deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing and at such other
times thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by such parties such additional
agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request for the purpose
of carrying out this Agreement and the Transactions. The parties shall afford
each other access to all information, documents, records and personnel who may
be necessary for any party to comply with laws or regulations (including the
filing and payment of taxes and handling tax audits), to fulfill its obligations
with respect to indemnification hereunder or to defend itself

                                       44

fees and expenses of legal counsel and investment bankers) related to preparing,
printing, filing and mailing the Registration Statement, the Proxy/Prospectus
and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with the
Registration Statement, and Proxy/Prospectus shall be allocated one-half each.

            (b) "Expenses" as used in this Agreement shall include all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of

consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its
behalf in connection with or related to the due diligence, authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the
preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy/Prospectus, the solicitation of stockholder approvals, and all other
matters related to the consummation of the Transactions (subject to reasonable
documentation).

date hereof until the Effective Time, each party shall confer on a regular and
frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other parties to report

and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel with copies of all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions.

      7.7   Publicity. Neither Target, Parent nor any of their respective

hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as each such other party may
have, prior to such release or other announcement.

injunctions or other impediments or delays, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, subject, however, to the Target Stockholders' Approval and the
Parent Share Issuance Approval.

<PAGE>

Target Board of Directors from failing to make or from withdrawing or modifying
its recommendation to the Target stockholders hereunder if such Board of

faith that such action is necessary for Target's Board of Directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

             (b) Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the

Directors, after consultation with and in consultation with independent legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary for such Board
of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

             (c) If a Target Superior Proposal is received and Target accepts
such Target Superior Proposal and thereby terminates this Agreement under
Section 10.1(h), then, unless Parent terminates this Agreement under Section
10.1(h), prior to the termination of this Agreement taking effect under Section
10.1(h), Target shall be obligated to comply with Section 7.13(a) and the other
terms of this Agreement, including by holding the Target Special Meeting. If the
Target Stockholders' Approval is not secured at such meeting, then at such time
this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated by Target under Section 10.1(h),
Target shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee and the Expenses of Target up to
the Expense Cap as provided in Section 10.2. Target acknowledges and agrees that

          (f) by either Target or Parent, if either of the stockholder approvals

<PAGE>

          (g) by Parent, if (i) Target's Board of Directors withdraws, modifies
or changes its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner
adverse to Parent or resolves to do any of the foregoing or Target's Board of
Directors recommends to Target's stockholders any Target Acquisition Proposal or
resolves to do so; (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares
of Target's capital stock then representing 30% or more of the combined power to

Target Acquisition Proposal, and Target's Board of Directors in good faith
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal
counsel, that such Target Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in
a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Target Common Shares than the Transactions; provided, however, that
Target may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(h) unless it
pays the Termination Fee plus Parent's Expenses up to the Expense Cap and has
used all reasonable efforts to provide Parent with five business days prior
written notice of its intent to so terminate this Agreement together with a
detailed summary of the terms and conditions of such Target Acquisition
Proposal; provided further, during such five (5) day period, Target shall and
shall direct its respective financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good
faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would result, in the opinion of Target's Board of Directors, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in a revised
Parent proposal that is reasonably capable of being completed, and, if
consummated, may reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is at
least as favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Target
Common Stock as the Target Superior Proposal.

Price.

                   (A) a transaction is consummated, which transaction, if

Plains Exploration & Production Company
599 Dallas Street, Suite 700
Houston, Texas 77002-4804

terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, each share of Common Stock, par value $.02

         With respect to such Parent Common Shares the undersigned may receive

                  A. The undersigned shall not make any offer to sell or any

         of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 145,

         and delivery of the Shares to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger
         Agreement shall be registered under the Act on a Registration Statement
         on Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised, however, that,
         since the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of Target, any

         under the Act of the Shares to be sold, (ii) compliance with Rule 145
         promulgated under the Act (permitting limited sales under certain
         circumstances) or (iii) the availability of another exemption from

         placed on the certificates for the Shares, or any substitutions
         therefor, a legend stating in substance:

                  Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and may be sold,
                  transferred or otherwise disposed of only upon receipt by the
                  Corporation of an opinion of counsel acceptable to it that the
                  securities are being sold in compliance with the limitations
                  of Rule 145 or that some other exemption from registration
                  under the Act is available, or pursuant to a registration
                  statement under the Act."

         Execution of this letter shall not be considered an admission on the
part of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of Target for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Act or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned
may have to any claim that the undersigned is not such an affiliate on or after
the date of this letter.

                                                 Very truly yours,

<PAGE>

                                                                  Exhibit 8.2(c)

                                     TARGET
                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE

     On behalf of 3TEC Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Target"), I
hereby certify that all the information set forth below relating to the proposed
merger of Target into PXP Gulf Coast Inc. a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub")
and the wholly-owned subsidiary of Plains Exploration & Production Company, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), is true, correct and complete as of the date
hereof and will continue to be true and correct as of the Effective Time. To
make this certification, I have relied on my personal knowledge of the facts set
forth below or I have obtained information as to these matters from officers or
employees or other advisors in whom I have confidence and whose duties require
them to have personal knowledge thereof. I understand that each of Thompson &
Knight L.L.P. and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP will rely on this
certification in delivering certain opinions pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of February 2, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among
Parent, Merger Sub, and Target. Except as expressly provided otherwise,
capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings assigned to them in the
Merger Agreement.

     1.   The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with the Merger
          Agreement and the agreements referenced therein, and there are no
          other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those
          expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.

     2.   The fair market value of Parent Common Shares and cash received by
          each holder of Target Common Shares in connection with the Merger will
          be approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of
          Target Common Shares surrendered in the exchange.

     3.   To the best knowledge of Target, neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor
          any Related Person as defined in Attachment A) has any plan or
          intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly,
          any Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger.

     4.   To the best knowledge of Target, the aggregate fair market value,
          determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Stock to be
          received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of
          the value, determined at the Effective Time, of Target Common Shares
          and Target Warrants outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.
          For this purpose, we assume that the fair market value of the
          outstanding Target Common Shares and Target Warrants will equal the
          fair market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

<PAGE>

     5.   Prior to the Effective Time and in connection with or anticipation of
          the Merger, (i) none of the Target Common Shares will be redeemed,
          (ii) no extraordinary distribution will be made with respect to Target
          Common Shares, and (iii) none of the Target Common Shares will be
          acquired by Target or any Related Person.

     6.   Target will redeem its outstanding Series D Preferred Stock
          immediately before the Merger solely with Target's funds. Parent will
          provide no funds to Target, directly or indirectly, for Target to
          redeem such Series D Preferred Stock or for Target to repay debt
          incurred to redeem such stock.

     7.   The only capital stock of Target issued and outstanding is Target
          Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock.

     8.   Target and Target stockholders will each pay their respective
          expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.

     9.   Any compensation paid to the Target stockholders who enter (or have
          entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive contracts, if
          any, with Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation (a) will be
          for services actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be
          commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's
          length for similar services, and (c) will not represent consideration
          for the surrender of the Target Common Shares in the Merger.

     10.  No debt of Target is guaranteed by any Target stockholder.

     11.  Target owns no stock of Parent.

     12.  Merger Sub will acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair
          market value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of
          the gross assets held by Target immediately prior to the Merger. For
          purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Target to dissenters,
          amounts paid by Target to stockholders who receive cash or other
          property, Target assets used to pay its reorganization expenses, and
          all redemptions and distributions (including the redemption of the
          Series D Preferred Stock, but excluding regular, normal dividends)
          made by Target immediately preceding the transfer, will be included in
          assets of Target held immediately prior to the Merger.

     13.  No assets of Target have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed
          of which would prevent Parent from continuing the historic business of
          Target or from using a significant portion of Target's historic
          business assets in a business following the Merger. Target intends to
          continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its
          historic business assets in a business.

<PAGE>

     14.  Target is not an investment company as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)
          of the Code. An investment company is (a) a regulated investment
          company; (b) a real estate investment trust; or (c) a corporation (i)
          fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of whose total assets are
          stock and securities, and (ii) eighty percent (80%) or more of the
          value of whose total assets are held for investment. For this purpose,
          "total assets" shall not include cash and cash items (including
          receivables) and government securities.

     15.  The fair market value of the assets of Target transferred to Merger
          Sub in the Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities
          assumed or paid by Parent or Merger Sub, plus the amount of
          liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.

     16.  The total adjusted basis of the assets of Target transferred to Merger
          Sub in the Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities
          assumed or paid by Parent or Merger Sub, plus the amount of
          liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.

     17.  Target is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or
          similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

     18.  There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
          Target, or between Merger Sub and Target, that was or will be issued,
          acquired, or settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

     19.  Target has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for the
          Merger, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arm's length
          negotiations.

     20.  Target will not take, and Target is not aware of any plan or intention
          of any of the Target stockholders to take, any position on any
          federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any
          other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment
          of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
          of the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as
          defined in Code Section 1313(a)(1)).

     21.  No stock or securities of Target, or to the knowledge of Target, no
          stock or securities of Parent, will be issued to any Target
          stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent,
          Merger Sub, or Target in connection with the Merger.

     22.  No stock or securities of Parent or of Target will be issued to any
          Target stockholder for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder
          in connection with the Merger.

<PAGE>

     23.  The liabilities of Target to be assumed or paid by Parent and Merger

     For purposes of this certificate, a Related Person with respect to either
Parent or Merger Sub shall mean

          (i)   a corporation that, immediately before or immediately after a
     purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition of Parent Common
     Stock, is a member of an Affiliated Group (as defined herein) of which
     Parent (or any successor corporation) is a member, or

          (ii)  a corporation in which Parent (or any successor corporation),
     owns, or which owns with respect to Parent (or any successor corporation),
     directly or indirectly, immediately before or immediately after such
     purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition, at least 50% of the
     total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at
     least 50% of the total value of shares of all classes of stock, taking into
     account for purposes of this clause (ii) any stock owned by 5% or greater
     stockholders of Parent (or any successor) or such corporation, a
     proportionate share of the stock owned by entities in which Parent (or any

     acquired pursuant to the exercise of options.

     For purposes of this certificate, "Affiliated Group" shall mean one or more
chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent
corporation, but only if

          (x)   the common parent owns directly stock that possesses at least
     80% of the total voting power, and has a value at least equal to 80% of the
     total value, of the stock in at least one of the other corporations, and

          (y)   stock possessing at least 80% of the total voting power, and

                              PARENT AND MERGER SUB
                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE

       On behalf of Plains Exploration & Production Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary PXP Gulf Coast Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), I hereby certify that all the information
set forth below relating to the proposed merger of 3TEC Energy Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Target"), into Merger Sub is true, correct and complete
as of the date hereof and will continue to be true and correct as of the
Effective Time. To make this certification, I have relied on my personal
knowledge of the facts set forth below or I have obtained information as to
these matters from officers or employees or other advisors in whom I have
confidence and whose duties require them to have personal knowledge thereof. I
understand that each of Thompson & Knight L.L.P. and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &
Feld LLP will rely on this certification in delivering certain opinions pursuant
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 2, 2003 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among Parent, Merger Sub, and Target. Except as expressly
provided otherwise, capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

     1.   The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with the Merger
          Agreement and the agreements referenced therein, and there are no
          other written or oral agreements relating to the Merger other than
          those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.

     2.   In connection with the Merger, no Target Common Shares will be
          acquired by Parent or a Related Person (as defined in Attachment A)
          for consideration other than Parent Common Shares, except for the Cash
          Consideration, payments to the dissenting stockholders, if any, and
          any cash received in lieu of fractional share interests in Parent
          Common Shares.

     3.   The fair market value of Parent Common Shares and cash received by
          each holder of Target Common Shares in connection with the Merger will
          be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Target Common
          Shares surrendered in the exchange.

     4.   Parent will provide no funds to Target, directly or indirectly, for
          Target to redeem its Series D Preferred Stock or for Target to repay
          debt incurred to redeem such stock.

     5.   Neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any Related Person as defined in
          Attachment A) has any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise
          reacquire, directly or indirectly, any Parent Common Shares to be
          issued in the Merger.

     6.   Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or
          intention to adopt such a plan.

<PAGE>

     7.   To the best knowledge of Parent, the aggregate fair market value,
          determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares to be
          received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of
          the value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Target Common
          Shares and Target Warrants outstanding immediately before the
          Effective Time. For this purpose, we assume that the fair market value
          of the outstanding Target Common Shares and Target Warrants will equal
          the fair market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

     8.   Neither Parent nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned during
          the past five years, any shares of stock of the Target. Neither Parent
          nor any Related Person has caused any other person to acquire stock of
          the Target on behalf of Parent or a Related Person, and will not
          directly or indirectly acquire any stock of the Target in connection
          with the Merger, except as described in the Merger Agreement.

     9.   Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or
          property to the Target (or any entity controlled directly or
          indirectly by the Target) for less than full and adequate
          consideration and has not made any loan to the Target (or any entity
          controlled directly or indirectly by the Target) in anticipation of
          the Merger.

     10.  There is no intercompany indebtedness existing between Parent and
          Target, or between Merger Sub and Target, that was or will be issued,
          acquired, or settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

     11.  Parent will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with or as
          part of the Merger or related transactions. Parent has not paid and
          will not pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer
          taxes) incurred by any holder of Target Common Shares in connection
          with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Parent has
          not agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any
          expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder
          of Target Common Shares.

     12.  Any compensation paid to the holders of Target Common Shares who enter
          (or have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive
          contracts, if any, with Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving
          Corporation (a) will be for services actually rendered or to be
          rendered, (b) will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties
          bargaining at arm's length for similar services, and (c) will not
          represent consideration for the surrender of the Target Common Shares
          in the Merger.

     13.  Merger Sub is wholly and directly owned by Parent and has been newly
          formed solely to consummate the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
          Merger Sub will have no assets other than cash to satisfy capital
          requirements under state law and has not, and will not, conduct any
          business activities or other operations of any kind other than the
          issuance of its stock to Parent or as otherwise expressly required by
          the Merger Agreement.

<PAGE>

     14.  At the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger Sub will not have or issue
          any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of
          right pursuant to which any person could acquire any stock in Merger
          Sub.

     15.  Merger Sub will acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair
          market value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of
          the gross assets held by Target immediately prior to the Merger. For
          purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Target to dissenters,
          amounts paid by Target to stockholders who receive cash or other
          property, Target assets used to pay its reorganization expenses, and
          all redemptions and distributions (including the redemption of the
          Series D Preferred Stock, but excluding regular, normal dividends)
          made by Target immediately preceding the transfer, will be included in
          assets of Target held immediately prior to the Merger.

     16.  Following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will continue the
          historic business of Target or use a significant portion of its assets
          in a business, within the meaning of Treas. Reg.ss.1.368-1(d).

     17.  Parent has no plan or intention to liquidate the Surviving Corporation
          following the Merger; to merge the Surviving Corporation with another
          corporation; to sell or otherwise dispose of the stock of Merger Sub;
          or to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of Target except
          for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers
          or successive transfers to one or more corporations controlled (within
          the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) in each case by the
          transferor corporation.

     18.  Following the Merger, Parent has no plan or intention to cause the
          Surviving Corporation to issue additional shares of its stock that
          would result in Parent owning stock possessing less than eighty
          percent (80%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of
          stock entitled to vote or less than eighty percent (80%) of the total
          number of shares of all other classes of stock of the Surviving
          Corporation.

     19.  Parent is paying no consideration for the Target stock other than the
          Merger Consideration.

     20.  To the best knowledge of Parent, any Target liabilities assumed or
          paid by Parent or Merger Sub and the liabilities to which the
          transferred assets of the Target are subject were incurred by the
          Target in the ordinary course of its business.

     21.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an investment company within the
          meaning of Sections 368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is
          (1) a regulated investment company; (2) a real estate investment
          trust; or (3) a corporation (i) fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          value of whose total assets are stock and securities, and (ii) eighty
          percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total assets are held for
          investment. For this purpose, "total assets" shall not include cash
          and cash items (including receivables) and government securities.

<PAGE>

     22.  Parent has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for the
          Merger, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arm's length
          negotiations.

     23.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will take any position on
          any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take
          any other tax reporting position that is inconsistent with the
          treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
          Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a
          "determination" (as defined in Code Section 1313(a)(1)).

     24.  No stock or securities of Parent will be issued to any Target
          stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent,
          Merger Sub, or the Target in connection with the Merger.

     25.  To the best knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of the Target
          will be issued to any Target stockholder for services rendered to or
          for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Target in connection
          with the Merger.

     26.  No stock or securities of Parent will be issued for any indebtedness
          owed to any Target stockholder in connection with the Merger.

     27.  To the best knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of the Target
          will be issued for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder in
          connection with the Merger.

     28.  No stock of Merger Sub will be issued in connection with the Merger.

     29.  Rights received by the Parent stockholders pursuant to Parent's
          [Poison Pill Agreement] are not separately tradeable, are contingent,
          are non-exercisable, are subject to redemption if they become
          exercisable, and have no ascertainable fair market value.

     30.  The undersigned officer is authorized to make all of the
          certifications and representations set forth herein.
