<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors of In Focus and the Board of Directors of Proxima have each determined that it is advisable, and in the best interest of their respective
stockholders, to combine their respective businesses under the ownership of one company; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors of In Focus and the Board of Directors of Proxima have, in accordance with the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization,
