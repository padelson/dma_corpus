ARTICLE I 
THE EXCHANGE OFFER

  

 1.1 The Exchange Offer. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement, In Focus shall commence, in compliance with Norwegian law, a public tender offer (the "Exchange Offer") to the holders of ordinary shares, par value NOK 2 per share, of Proxima (the "Proxima Ordinary Shares"), to exchange, subject to the Exchange Offer Conditions, .3615 share of common stock, no par value, of In Focus (the "In Focus Common Stock"), for each Proxima Ordinary Share held by such holder (such  .3615-for-one exchange to be offered pursuant to this Section 1.1(a), with such adjustments as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6, being referred to herein as the "Exchange Offer Ratio"). The maximum number of shares of In Focus Common Stock to be issued in exchange for 

   

Page 1 - BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT  the acquisition by In Focus of all Proxima Ordinary Shares outstanding on a
Fully Diluted Basis shall be 15,825,000, with such adjustments as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.6.

  

 (b) The obligation of In Focus to consummate the Exchange Offer and issue In Focus Common Stock in exchange for the Proxima Ordinary Shares tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, shall be subject only to satisfaction or waiver of (i) the condition that there shall have been validly tendered and available for purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer, prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Date, a number of Proxima Ordinary Shares that represents more than 90% of the outstanding Proxima Ordinary Shares (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Article VII (together with the Minimum Condition, the "Exchange Offer Conditions"). 

  

 (c) The expiration date of the Exchange Offer shall initially be the date which is 30 calendar days after commencement of the Exchange Offer or such other date mutually agreeable to In Focus and Proxima (such date, as it may be extended as provided herein, the "Exchange Offer Expiration Date"). In Focus shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without Proxima\'s consent, to extend the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, at any time and from time to time, but in no event shall the Exchange Offer Expiration Date be later than the Outside Termination Date. If at any scheduled Exchange Offer Expiration Date any of the Exchange Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived by In Focus, at Proxima\'s written request delivered to In Focus no later than such Exchange Offer Expiration Date, In Focus shall extend the Exchange Offer until a date not later than the Outside Termination Date. 

  

 (d) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Exchange Offer Conditions, In Focus shall, at the earliest practicable time following the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and after it is permitted to do so under applicable law, accept for exchange, by written notice to the Exchange Agent, and shall exchange, all Proxima Ordinary Shares validly tendered (the "Share Exchange") and shall effect the Share Exchange in accordance with applicable law (the date In Focus gives such written notice to the Exchange Agent being referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). 

  

 (e) No holder of Proxima Ordinary Shares will be entitled to receive fractional shares of In Focus Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Offer. In lieu thereof, In Focus shall round to the next highest whole number the number of shares issuable to such holders otherwise entitled to a fractional share. 

  

 1.2 Norwegian Exchange Offer Documents. As soon as reasonably practicable after the public announcement of this Agreement, In Focus shall prepare and file with the Oslo Stock Exchange ("OSE") a preliminary prospectus/offer document (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document") with respect to the Exchange Offer, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document cleared by the OSE as promptly as practicable after the filing. The Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document shall contain an offer to exchange, listing particulars, a form of acceptance, and any other documents required to be filed pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 1997 (the "Securities Trading Act") and the Norwegian Stock Exchange Regulations No. 30 of January 17, 1994 (the Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document and such other documents, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, are sometimes collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Offer Documents"). The Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document shall also contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Proxima that the holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares accept the Exchange Offer and tender their Proxima Ordinary Shares to In Focus thereunder. Proxima agrees to provide to In Focus, as promptly as practicable, such information concerning its stockholders, business, financial statements and affairs as may be reasonably required or appropriate for inclusion in the Exchange Offer Documents and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with In Focus\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Exchange Offer Documents. In Focus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Proxima Ordinary Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable Norwegian law, as promptly as practicable after (i) the Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document has been cleared by the OSE, and (ii) the Norwegian Tax Approval has been obtained and is in full force and effect, _provided_

  

Page 2 - BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT  Proxima may waive this condition or require the offer to proceed subject to
this condition. Proxima and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to
review and comment on the Exchange Offer Documents prior to their being filed
with the OSE, and Proxima shall be promptly advised of and consulted with
respect to any comments that In Focus receives from the OSE or its staff with
respect to the Exchange Offer Documents promptly after receipt of any such
comments.

  

 1.3 Mandatory Offer; Compulsory Acquisition. If In Focus acquires or holds, as a result of the Exchange Offer or otherwise, a number of Proxima Ordinary Shares representing more than 40% of the voting rights in Proxima, then In Focus will commence a mandatory offer (the "Mandatory Offer") pursuant to the Securities Trading Act. If In Focus acquires or holds more than 90% of the total issued shares and voting rights in Proxima then outstanding, after having made the Mandatory Offer, In Focus will, pursuant to Section 4-25 of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act (the "Companies Act"), commence a process leading to a compulsory acquisition for cash of all Proxima Ordinary Shares not theretofore acquired by In Focus at a price to be determined in accordance with the Companies Act. 

  

 1.4 Proxima Action. 

  

 (a) Proxima hereby approves and consents to the Exchange Offer and represents that the Board of Directors of Proxima, at a meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Exchange Offer, are fair to and in the best interest of the holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) recommended that the holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares accept the Exchange Offer, and tender their Proxima Ordinary Shares thereunder to In Focus. 

  

 (b) Proxima shall promptly, at In Focus\'s request, cause its transfer agent to furnish In Focus with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Proxima Ordinary Shares and with security position listings of the Proxima Ordinary Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses, and security position listings of record holders and beneficial holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares. Proxima shall furnish In Focus with such additional information, including, without limitation, updated listings and files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings and such other assistance as In Focus or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Exchange Offer to record and beneficial holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares. 

  

 1.5 Exchange Agent. In Focus shall appoint a bank or trust company or other independent financial institution to act as exchange agent for the Exchange Offer (the "Exchange Agent"). 

  

 1.6 Anti-Dilution Protection for Exchange Offer Ratio. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of In Focus Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Offer Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Material Adverse Effect) the consolidated financial position of Proxima and
its consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended. Each Subsidiary of Proxima is treated as a
consolidated subsidiary of Proxima in the Proxima Financial Statements for

 3.7 Absence of Changes. The In Focus SEC Filings and the Proxima OSE Filings are referred to, as applicable, as the "Representing Party\'s Filings," and the In Focus Financial Statements and the Proxima Financial Statements are referred to, as applicable, as the "Representing Party\'s Financial Statements."

 3.8 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities of the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute, determined or determinable, that are material to such Representing Party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than (a) liabilities disclosed or provided for in such Representing Party\'s Financial Statements, (b) liabilities disclosed in the Representing Party\'s Filings or disclosed as liabilities on the Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule, (c) liabilities incurred on behalf of the Representing Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (d) liabilities not required to be disclosed on the face of such party\'s balance sheet under applicable generally accepted accounting principles, and (e) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of the Representing Party\'s latest financial statements included in such Representing Party\'s Filings, none of which, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.9 Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of each Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule, there are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Representing Party, threatened against such Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets before any Governmental Entity. The claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations disclosed in the Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule, if adversely determined, would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Representing Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.10 Taxes. The Representing Party and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or caused to be filed (or there has been timely filed on their behalf) all income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be filed on or prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to file such Tax Returns have been filed, granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file or to have extensions granted that remain in effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. The Representing Party and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or there has been paid on their behalf) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, and the most recent Representing Party\'s Financial Statements contained in the Representing Party\'s Filings reflect an adequate liability in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied for all Taxes payable by the Representing Party and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. No deficiencies for any Tax have been proposed or asserted in writing or assessed, in each case by any taxing authority, against the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries for which there are not adequate liabilities accrued on the latest balance sheet included in the Representing Party\'s Financial Statements. The Representing Party nor any of its Subsidiaries are a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G.

Proxima shall (i) notify In Focus promptly (and in any event within one business day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to Proxima or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Proxima or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) notify Proxima promptly of any material change to any such Acquisition Proposal or request and (iii) upon reasonable request by In Focus, provide In Focus all material information about any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.

ARTICLE V 
TREATMENT OF PROXIMA STOCK OPTION PLANS

  

 5.1 U.S. Stock Option Plan. Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Proxima Ordinary Shares (the "Proxima U.S. Options") under the Proxima Amended 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "Proxima U.S. Option Plan"), whether vested or unvested, shall be, in connection with the Share Exchange, assumed by In Focus. Each Proxima U.S. Option so assumed by In Focus under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Proxima U.S. Option Plan, and/or as provided in the respective option agreements governing such Proxima U.S. Option immediately prior to consummation of the Share Exchange, except that (A) such Proxima U.S. Option shall be exercisable for the number of whole shares of In Focus Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Proxima Ordinary Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Proxima U.S. Option immediately prior to consummation of the Share Exchange, multiplied by the Exchange Offer Ratio rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of In Focus Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price for the In Focus Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Proxima U.S. Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share at which such Proxima U.S. Option was exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange by the Exchange Offer Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Promptly following the consummation of the Share Exchange, In Focus will issue to each holder of an outstanding Proxima U.S. Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Proxima U.S. Option by In Focus. To the extent that such Proxima U.S. Option was qualified under Section 422 of the Code, In Focus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such option to continue to be so qualified. 

  

 5.2 Norwegian Stock Option Plans. 

   

 (a) Proxima shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of an outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Proxima Ordinary Shares (individually, a "Proxima Norwegian Option" and collectively, the "Proxima Norwegian Options") under the stock option plans maintained by Proxima in Norway (collectively, the "Proxima Norwegian Option Plans") to agree in writing, prior to the Effective Time, to allow In Focus to assume his or her Proxima Norwegian Option, as of the Effective Time, pursuant to an Option Assumption Agreement on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to In Focus (individually, an "Option Assumption Agreement" and collectively, the "Option Assumption Agreements"). Each Proxima Norwegian Option so assumed by In Focus under an Option Assumption Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Norwegian Option Plans, as applicable, and as provided in the respective individual option agreement governing such Proxima Norwegian Option immediately prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, except that (i) such Proxima Norwegian Option shall be exercisable for the number of whole shares of In Focus Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Proxima Ordinary Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Proxima Norwegian Option immediately prior to consummation of the Share Exchange, multiplied by the Exchange Offer Ratio rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of In Focus Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the In Focus Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Proxima Norwegian Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share at which such Proxima Norwegian Option was exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange by the Exchange Offer Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

  

 (b) If an insufficient number of holders of Proxima Norwegian Options enter into Option Assumption Agreements, such that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not, in the opinion of In Focus\'s independent accountants, qualify for accounting as a "pooling of interests" under APB No. 16 and applicable SEC rules and regulations, Proxima shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such option holders to take such other actions and enter into such other agreements as In Focus may reasonably request to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to so qualify.

In Focus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any SEC comments regarding its Proxy Statement and to have such comments cleared as promptly as practicable, and shall promptly mail the Proxy Statement in its definitive form to its shareholders after the Norwegian Prospectus/Offer Document has been mailed to the holders of the Proxima Ordinary Shares. Proxima agrees to provide as promptly as 

  

Page 17 - BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT  practicable to In Focus such information concerning its stockholders and its
business and financial statements and affairs as may reasonably be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or in any amendments or
supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with

fail to take any action that could be reasonably expected to result in the
nonfulfillment of any such condition.

satisfaction of this condition;

  

 (g) Proxima shall, in all material respects, have performed and complied with all obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and In Focus shall have received a Certificate of the Chief Executive Officer of Proxima as to the satisfaction of this condition;

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of In Focus and may be waived by In Focus in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of In Focus. The failure by In Focus at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Any determination by In Focus concerning the events described above will be final and binding on all parties.

 (c) By In Focus, (i) if any representation or warranty of Proxima contained in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects and the failure of such representation or warranty to be true and correct (1) has a Material Adverse Effect on Proxima, and (2) if capable of being made true and correct within 30 days following receipt by Proxima of notice of such representation or warranty not being true and correct is not in fact made true and correct within such 30-day period, or (ii) if there has been a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Proxima set forth in this Agreement, which breach is incapable of being cured by Proxima or is not cured within 30 days following receipt by Proxima of notice of such breach;

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Proxima or In Focus as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given as promptly as possible to the other party hereto, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of either Proxima or In Focus (or any of their respective Representatives or affiliates), except (i) that the provisions of Sections 6.1(b) and 6.4, this Section 8.2 and Article IX will continue to apply following any such termination, (ii) that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and (iii) as provided in Section 8.2(b) below.

modification as may be necessary to make such provision or action permissible
shall be deemed to have taken place.

  

 8.3 Amendment.
