At the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares for which dissenters rights have been or will be perfected in accordance with
California Law), will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action, cease to exist, and all such shares will be converted into the right to receive from Parent the Closing Cash Amount and the

shares of Parent Common Stock) and the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.5 (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights). At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to ChaseMellon

each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Company

the Company Certificates in exchange for the Closing Cash Amount, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate

Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for such purchase. In the
event that any Company Shareholder fails to make an effective demand for such purchase or otherwise loses his status as a holder of Dissenting Shares, Parent shall, as of the later of the Effective
Time or ten business days from the occurrence of such event, issue and deliver, upon surrender by such shareholder of its Company Certificate or Certificates, shares of Parent Common Stock, the

The arbitrator shall determine the party who is the prevailing party and the party who is the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs,
fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by the prevailing party, the fees of the arbitrator and
the administrative fee of the arbitration proceedings. </FONT></P>

compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the parties or by the American Arbitration Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator
in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation. </FONT></P>

have the opportunity to make such reasonable objection to any of the arbitrators listed as such party may wish and that the American Arbitration Association will select the arbitrator from the list of
arbitrators as to whom neither party makes any such objection. In the event that the foregoing procedure is not followed, each party will choose one person from the list of arbitrators provided by the
American Arbitration Association (provided that such person does not have a conflict of interest), and the two persons so selected will select from the list provided by the American Arbitration
Association the person who will act as the arbitrator. </FONT></P>
