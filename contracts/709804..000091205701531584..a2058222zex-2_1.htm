ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

  

 2.1 _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and California Law, at the Effective Time, Company shall be merged with and into Sub, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease, and Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. The corporation surviving the Merger shall be referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation._ " 

  

 2.2 _ Conversion of Shares._ 

  

  

 2.2.1 _ Conversion of Sub Stock._ At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding as one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of common stock of Sub shall evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.2.2 _ Conversion of Company Capital Stock._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each share of Company Capital Stock held by a Company Shareholder that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting Shares, will, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof 

  

    

 (except as expressly provided herein), be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive:

    

 (a) at the Effective Time, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined in accordance with Section 2.2.3(a) below (the " _Share Conversion Number_ "); 

  

 (b) at the Effective Time, the Closing Cash Amount; and 

  

 (c) upon the Hold-Back Release Date, the Hold-Back Cash Amount, if any. 

    

 The preceding provisions of this Section 2.2.2 are subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 (regarding the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares), Section 2.4 (regarding the elimination of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and Section 2.5 (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights). 

  

 2.2.3 _ Calculation of Share Conversion Number and Closing Cash Consideration._ 

  

 (a) The Share Conversion Number shall be calculated as follows: 

    

 (i) Subject to subsections (ii) and (iii) below, the Share Conversion Number shall be the quotient (calculated to the fourth decimal place) obtained by dividing the Parent Share Number by the Outstanding Capital Stock Number. 

  

 (ii) In the event that the Closing Price Per Share exceeds the Signing Price Per Share by more than $1.00, the Share Conversion Number shall be the quotient (calculated to the fourth decimal place) obtained by dividing the Maximum Parent Share Number by the Outstanding Capital Stock Number. 

  

 (iii) In the event that the Closing Price Per Share is less than the Signing Price Per Share by more than $0.50, the Share Conversion Number shall be the quotient (calculated to the fourth decimal place) obtained by dividing the Minimum Parent Share Number by the Outstanding Capital Stock Number. 

    

 (b) In the event that the Closing Price Per Share is less than the Signing Price Per Share, the amount of the Closing Cash Amount shall be reduced such that the sum of the Closing Cash Amount and the Hold-Back Cash Amount equals the product of the Share Conversion Number multiplied by the Closing Price Per Share. 

  

  

 2.3 _ Dissenting Shares._ As more fully set forth in Section 7.3, holders of shares of Company Capital Stock who have complied with all requirements for perfecting shareholder dissenters\' rights, as set forth in Section 1300 et seq. of California Law, shall be entitled to their rights under California Law with respect to such shares. 

  

 2.4 _ Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2.2, computed after aggregating all shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder pursuant to Section 2.2.2, will instead receive from Parent, upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Certificates pursuant to Article 7, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the Closing Price Per Share by (b) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive. 

  

 2.5 _ Continuation of Vesting and Repurchase Rights._ If any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are at the Effective Time unvested or are subject to a repurchase option (other than a right of first refusal) or any other condition providing that such shares may be forfeited to Company upon any termination of the shareholder\'s employment, directorship or other relationship with Company (and/or any affiliate of Company) under the terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement, stock option agreement (including any stock option agreement 

    under the Company Plan), any Employment and Non-Competition Agreement or
other agreement with Company (" _Unvested Company Shares_ "), then
such repurchase option or other condition shall be assigned to Parent and the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such Unvested
Company Shares in the Merger will be unvested shares and will continue to be
subject to the same repurchase options or conditions, as applicable,
immediately following the Effective Time as the Unvested Company Shares for
which such shares were exchanged were subject to immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The certificates representing unvested shares of Parent Common
Stock shall accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting
such repurchase options or other conditions. The Closing Cash Amount payable
by Parent with respect to each Unvested Company Share pursuant to Section
2.2.2 shall be held back by Parent at the Closing and shall become payable,
together with any Hold-Back Cash Amount, to the holder of such Unvested
Company Share within five (5) business days of the date that the unvested
share(s) of Parent Common Stock, that have been exchanged for such Unvested
Company Share hereunder, become vested in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the relevant Company agreement assigned to Parent hereunder with
respect to such Unvested Company Share. The Company shall take all actions
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement, stock option agreement,
Employment and Non-Competition Agreement or other agreement.

  

 2.6 _ Adjustments for Capital Changes._ Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2, if Parent recapitalizes, either through a subdivision (or stock split) of any of its outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into a greater number of such shares, or a combination (or reverse stock split) of any of its outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into a lesser number of such shares, or reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into the same or a different number of shares of other classes or series of Parent stock (other than through a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in the preceding clause), or declares a dividend or other distribution on its outstanding shares payable in shares of Parent Common Stock, in shares or securities convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock and/or other Parent equity securities (each, a " _Capital Change_ "), at any time after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, then the Signing Price Per Share, the Closing Price Per Share, the Share Conversion Number and the Option Conversion Number will be appropriately adjusted. 

  

 2.7 _ Company Options and Warrants._ 

  

  

 2.7.1 _ Company Options._ At the Effective Time, all Company Options will be assumed and substituted by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed and substituted by Parent shall be entitled, in accordance with the terms of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, to purchase after the Effective Time that number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to such Company Option at the Effective Time by (b) the Option Conversion Number. After the Effective Time, the exercise price for each such assumed and substituted Company Option will equal the exercise price of the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Conversion Number. If the foregoing calculation results in an assumed and substituted option being exercisable for a fraction of a share or a fraction of a cent, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the exercise price of such option will be rounded up to the nearest cent. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the term, exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all other terms of the Company Options will otherwise be unchanged. Continuous employment with Company will be credited to an optionee for purposes of determining the number of shares that are vested after the Effective Time. Parent will cause the Parent Common Stock issued upon exercise of the assumed and substituted Company Options to be registered on a Form S-8 registration statement with the SEC no later than fifteen days after 

  

    

 the Effective Time, which Form S-8 will be immediately effective upon the
filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent will exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such assumed and substituted Company Options remain outstanding and
will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for issuance upon exercise thereof.

  

 2.7.2 _ Company Warrants._ At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock (each a " _Company Warrant_ "), whether or not exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company capital stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Conversion Number, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock at which such Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Conversion Number, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

  

  

 2.8 _ Effects of the Merger._ At and upon the Effective Time:

 (h) the members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time will be the members of the Board of Directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

    

  (i) the Merger will, from and after the Effective Time, have all of the
effects provided by applicable law.

  

  

 2.9 _ Fairness Hearing; S-3 Registration Alternative._ 

  

  

 2.9.1 _ Fairness Hearing._ The Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will, subject to Section 2.9.2 below, be qualified by a permit (the " _Permit_ ") issued under Section 25121 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (the " _Securities Law_ ") after a fairness hearing (the " _Fairness Hearing_ ") to be held as soon as possible before the California Commissioner of Corporations pursuant to Section 25142 of the Securities Law and shall thereby be an exempt transaction under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. Within 15 business days of the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the California Department of Corporations (the " _Department_ ") a permit for qualification of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and an application for a Fairness Hearing together with the disclosure statement included therein (the " _Disclosure Statement_ ") and any other documents required by the Securities Law, in connection with the Merger. Parent shall use its best efforts to have the Permit issued under the Securities Law as promptly as practicable after such filing, provided that Parent will have no obligation to change any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or to make any change in its rights and obligations with respect to its securities or its security holders in order to obtain the Permit. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger. 

  

 2.9.2 _ S-3 Registration Alternative._ If Parent is unable to obtain the Permit, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Company Shareholders in the Merger as provided in Section 2.2.2 shall be issued pursuant to an exemption or exemptions from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and the exemption from qualification under the laws of the State of California and other applicable state securities laws. In such event, within 15 days of the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the " _S-3_ ") with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Company Shareholders at the Effective Time for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 and will use its best efforts to cause the S-3 to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing. Parent will use its best efforts to keep the S-3 continuously effective under the Securities Act for a period of eighteen (18) months following the date that the S-3 is declared effective by the SEC, subject to any requirement that Parent amend the S-3 from time to time in order the cause the prospectus therein to remain current. 

  

  

 2.10 _ Market Standoff._ 

  

  

 2.10.1Without any further action by the holders of the Company Capital Stock, the receipt of shares of Parent Common Stock by each such holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be an acknowledgement and agreement by such holder that the shares of Parent Common Stock, the options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives pursuant to the Merger, if any, and the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such options (collectively, the " _Parent Securities_ "), may not be sold or otherwise transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, (collectively, " _Transferred_ "), directly or indirectly, in any manner, except in accordance with the following terms and conditions: (i) thirty-three percent (33%) of the Parent Securities held by each such holder and their permitted transferees may be Transferred at any time after the Effective Time; (ii) an additional thirty-three percent (33%) of the Parent Securities held by such holders and their permitted transferees may be Transferred at any time after the 90-day anniversary of the Effective Time; and (iii) an additional thirty-three percent (33%) of the Parent Securities held by such holders and their permitted transferees may be Transferred at any time after the 180-day 

  

    

 anniversary of the Effective Time. The certificates representing the shares
of Parent Securities shall accordingly be marked with appropriate legends
noting such market standoff restrictions.

  

 2.10.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.10.1, a holder of Parent Securities may gift such securities, Transfer such securities to a trust where such holder, his or her spouse and/or his or her children are the sole beneficiaries, or distribute such securities to its partners; provided, however, that in each case, the transferee of the Parent Securities agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Section 2.10. 

  

  

 2.11 _ Tax Consequences._ The parties intend that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the parties hereto adopts this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax Regulations and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including reporting the Merger for federal and state income tax purposes in a manner consistent with such characterization. However, Parent makes no representations or warranties to Company or to any Company Shareholder or other holder of Company securities regarding the tax treatment of the Merger, whether the Merger will qualify as a tax-free plan of reorganization under the Code, or any of the tax consequences to Company or to any Company Shareholder or other holder of Company securities of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby, and Company and the Company Shareholders acknowledge that Company and the Company Shareholders are relying solely on their own tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 2.12 _ Purchase Accounting._ The parties intend that the Merger be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. 

  

 2.13 _ Further Assurances._ If, at any time before or after the Effective Time, Parent believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors will execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments and assurances and do all other things necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 7.2 _ Exchange._ 

  

  

 7.2.1 At the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares for which dissenters rights have been or will be perfected in accordance with California Law), will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action, cease to exist, and all such shares will be converted into the right to receive from Parent the Closing Cash Amount and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.2, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 (regarding the elimination of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) and the provisions of Section 2.5 (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights). At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to ChaseMellon Shareholder Services (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") the Closing Cash Consideration and certificates representing Parent Common Stock to be paid and issued in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and cash in an amount sufficient to permit the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4. Within ten business days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") and which shares were converted into the right to receive the Closing Cash Amount and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2.2, (a) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Closing Cash Amount, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation or upon delivery of an affidavit of lost certificate and an indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent (the " _Affidavit_ ") or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 (regarding the elimination of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) and the provisions of Section 2.5 (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights), (a) Parent or its transfer agent will issue to each tendering holder of a Company Certificate or an Affidavit, certificates (a " _Tendering Company Holder_ ") for the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.2; and (b) Parent or its transfer agent will pay by check to each Tendering Company Holder cash in the amount payable to such holder in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.2.2 and 2.4. 

  

    

  7.2.2 No dividends or distributions payable to holders of record of
Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Certificate unless and until the holder of such
unsurrendered Company Certificate surrenders such Company Certificate or an
Affidavit to the Exchange Agent as provided above. Subject to the effect, if
any, of applicable escheat and other laws, following surrender of any Company
Certificate or Affidavit, there will be delivered to the Person entitled
thereto, without interest, the amount of any dividends and distributions
theretofore paid with respect to Parent Common Stock so withheld as of any
date subsequent to the Effective Time and prior to such date of delivery.

   

 7.2.3 After the Effective Time there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Company or its transfer agent of any shares of capital stock of Company that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or an Affidavit are presented for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 7.2. 

  

 7.2.4 Until Company Certificates or an Affidavit representing shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are surrendered pursuant to Section 7.2.1 above, such Company Certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital Stock will have been converted pursuant to Section 2.2.2, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 (regarding the elimination of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock). 

  

  

 7.3 _ Dissenters\' Rights._ If holders of Company Capital Stock are entitled to dissenters\' rights pursuant to Section 1300 et seq. California Law in connection with the Merger, any shares held by Company Shareholders who exercise and perfect such dissenters\' rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive Parent Common Stock and cash consideration, but shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law. Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in no event more than two business days) of any demand received by Company for such purchase of Company Capital Stock, and Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for such purchase. In the event that any Company Shareholder fails to make an effective demand for such purchase or otherwise loses his status as a holder of Dissenting Shares, Parent shall, as of the later of the Effective Time or ten business days from the occurrence of such event, issue and deliver, upon surrender by such shareholder of its Company Certificate or Certificates, shares of Parent Common Stock, the Closing Cash Amount, the Hold-Back Cash Amount (if applicable) and any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without interest thereon, to which such shareholder would have been entitled to under Section 2.2.2 of this Agreement.

 (c) Any Claim (as defined in Section 11.5) made by a Parent Indemnified Person or a Company Indemnified Person under this Section 11.2 must be raised in a Notice of Claim (as defined in Section 11.5) delivered to the Parent or the Representative, as the case may be, by no later than the applicable Release Date and, if raised by such date, such claim shall survive the Release Date until final resolution thereof. 

  

 (d) The amount which any party (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") is or may be required to pay to or on behalf of any other Person (the " _Indemnified Person_ ") pursuant to Article 11 shall be reduced (including retroactively) by (i) any amounts received by an Indemnified Person from an 

  

    

 insurance carrier or paid and resolved by an insurance carrier on behalf of
the insured (in a manner which shall result in no further liability to an
Indemnified Person), in either case net of any applicable premium adjustment,
retrospectively rated premium, deductible, retention, cost or reserve paid or
held by or for the benefit of the insured (" _Insurance Proceeds_ ") or (ii)
other amounts actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person in
reduction of the related Damages. If an Indemnified Person shall
have received the payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying
Person in respect of Damages and shall subsequently actually receive Insurance
Proceeds, or other amounts in respect of such Damages as specified above,
then such Indemnified Person shall pay to such Indemnifying Person a sum equal
to the amount of any such double recovery actually received.

  

  

 11.3 _ Hold-Back Cash Consideration._ 

  

  

 (a) Except for fraud or willful misrepresentation or willful misconduct or a Claim relating to breaches of the Major Representations, the aggregate liability of the Company Shareholders to the Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article 11 shall not exceed the Hold-Back Cash Consideration. The aggregate liability of the Company Shareholders to the Parent Indemnified Persons for a Claim relating to breaches of the Major Representations pursuant to this Article 11 shall not exceed an amount equal to twice the Hold-Back Cash Consideration, which amount shall include any Hold-Back Cash Consideration paid for any Claim which has been resolved pursuant to the terms hereof. With respect to all Claims under this Article 11, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall first seek compensation from the Hold-Back Cash Consideration prior to exercising any other remedies that may be available to the Parent Indemnified Persons. 

  

 (b) Except for fraud or willful misrepresentation or willful misconduct, the aggregate liability of Parent to the Company Indemnified Persons shall not exceed $15,000,000. 

  

 (c) Any Damages for which a Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 11 will be payable to such Parent Indemnified Person by the reduction of the amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the amount of such Damages to the extent that the amount of such Damages does not exceed the amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration available for such reduction (after giving effect to any previous reduction thereto) immediately upon the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the notice period provided for in Section 11.8(a) hereof; (ii) the execution of a written settlement of a Contested claim (as defined below) as provided in Section 11.8(b) hereof by both parties specified therein; or (iii) the rendering of a Final Award (as defined below) pursuant to Section 11.8(c) hereof. In the event of any Claim that the Representative shall, on the Hold-Back Release Date, be disputing pursuant to Section 11.8(b), Parent shall reduce the amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration to be paid to the Company Shareholders on the Hold-Back Release Date by the Estimated Claim Amount (as defined below) with respect thereto. Upon resolution of such dispute, Parent will pay to each Company Shareholder the amount of the Hold-Back Cash Consideration, if any, that such Company Shareholder would have been entitled to receive had such dispute been resolved prior to the Hold-Back Release Date, but which was not paid to such Shareholder on the Hold-Back Release Date as a result of the preceding sentence. To the extent the amount of any Damages exceeds the amount of remaining Hold-Back Cash Consideration available for reduction therefor, Parent shall be entitled to indemnification for such excess amount from the Company Shareholders pursuant to this Article 11 only for claims arising from breaches of Major Representations or arising from fraud or willful misrepresentation or willful misconduct, subject to the limitations set forth herein. The term " _Estimated Claim Amount_ " means the Indemnified Person\'s good faith estimate of the Damages claimed under any disputed Claim unresolved as of the Hold-Back Release Date. 

  

    

  (d) A Parent Indemnified Person may institute Claims against the Hold-
Back Cash Consideration and in satisfaction thereof may recover Hold-
Back Cash Consideration, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
without first making any other Claims directly against the Company
Shareholders, without rescinding or attempting to rescind any transaction
consummated by this Agreement and without first exhausting any other remedies
that may be available to it with respect to the subject matter of any Claim,
and such Parent Indemnified Person will proceed directly in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. The assertion of any single Claim for
indemnification hereunder will not bar an Indemnified Person from asserting
any other Claim or Claims hereunder.

  

 (e) On the Hold-Back Release Date, Parent shall deliver to the Company Shareholders that amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration as provided in Section 2.2.2 that is in excess of any amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration necessary to satisfy any then unsatisfied, unresolved or contested claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the Representative before the Hold-Back Release Date, together with interest on such amount of Hold-Back Cash Consideration accrued from the Effective Time through the Hold-Back Release Date at a rate equal to the prime rate of Bank of America in effect as of the Agreement Date (the " _Interest_ "). As soon as all such claims have been finally resolved, Parent shall deliver to the Company Shareholders all remaining Hold-Back Cash Consideration not applied to the satisfaction of such claims, together with Interest. 

  

  

 11.4 _ Appointment of Representative._ By voting in favor of the Merger, each of the Company Shareholders approves the designation of and designates Ramkumar Jayam as the representative of the Company Shareholders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each Company Shareholder (the " _Representative_ ") with respect to claims for indemnification under Article 11 and the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement, including the exercise of the power to: (a) authorize the release or delivery to a Parent Indemnified Party of Hold-Back Cash Consideration in satisfaction of Claims by such Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to Article 11; (b) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand arbitration of, and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such Claims; (c) arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any Claim made pursuant to Article 11; and (d) take all actions necessary in the judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Representative will have authority and power to act on behalf of each Company Shareholder with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all Claims under Article 11 and all rights or obligations arising under Article 11\. The Company Shareholders will be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Representative in connection with Article 11, except for any action that conflicts with the limitations set forth in Section 11.3(a), and a Parent Indemnified Person will be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Representative. In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Representative will not be liable to any Company Shareholder in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative. The Company Shareholders shall severally indemnify the Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with actions taken by the Representative pursuant to the terms of Article 11 (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs) will be paid by the Company Shareholders to the Representative pro rata based on each Company Shareholder\'s pro rata share of the Hold-Back Cash Consideration. 

  

 11.5 _ Notice of Claim._ 

  

  

 (a) As used herein, " _Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification of an Indemnified Person for Damages under Article 11\. The Indemnified Person shall give a written notice of a Claim executed 

  

    

 by an officer or an authorized Person of such Indemnified Person (a "
_Notice of Claim_ ") whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by
any other related Indemnified Person. The Indemnified Person may give a
Notice of Claim at any time such Indemnified Person or a related Indemnified
Person suffers Damages or is subject to a claim, demand, suit, action, cause
of action or other dispute that may give rise to a Claim. Parent or the
Representative, as the case may be, will deliver a Notice of Claim promptly
after it becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim for indemnity
under Article 11 or is requested to deliver a Notice of Claim on behalf of any
other Indemnified Person.

  

 (b) Parent shall deliver to the Representative a Notice of Claim before the applicable Release Date, arising from or relating to: 

  

 (A) (i) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by Company or the Company Shareholders in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter or in any agreement, certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Company or an officer of Company or a Company Shareholder pursuant hereto; (ii) any failure of any Company Shareholder to have good, valid and marketable title to the issued and outstanding capital stock of Company held by such Company Shareholders, free and clear of all liens, claims, pledges, options, adverse claims, assessments or charges of any nature whatsoever, or to have full right, capacity and authority to vote such capital stock in favor of the Merger; or (iii) any Excess Transaction Expenses; or 

  

 (B) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against Parent or against any other Parent Indemnified Person of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against such Indemnified Person (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that is based upon, or includes assertions that would, if true, constitute: (i) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by Company or the Company Shareholders in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter or in any agreement, certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Company or an officer of Company or a Company Shareholder pursuant hereto; (ii) any failure of any Company Shareholder to have good, valid and marketable title to the issued and outstanding capital stock of Company held by such Company Shareholders, free and clear of all liens, claims, pledges, options, adverse claims, assessments or charges of any nature whatsoever, or to have full right, capacity and authority to vote such capital stock in favor of the Merger; or (iii) any Excess Transaction Expenses. 

  

 (c) Representative shall deliver to Parent a Notice of Claim before the Parent Release Date, arising from or relating to 

  

 (A) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by Parent in this Agreement or in the Parent Disclosure Letter or in any agreement, certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Parent or an officer of Parent pursuant hereto; or 

  

 (B) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against Company or against any other Company Indemnified Person of a Third-Party Claim that is based upon, or includes assertions that would, if true, constitute any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by Parent in this Agreement or in the Parent Disclosure Letter or in any agreement, certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Parent or an officer of Parent pursuant hereto. 

  

 (d) Until the applicable Release Date, no delay on the part of an Indemnified Person in giving the Indemnifying Party a Notice of Claim will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its 

  

    

 obligations under Article 11 unless (and then only to the extent) that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.

  

  

 11.6 _ Defense of Third-Party Claims._ 

  

  

 (a) The Indemnified Person shall defend any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with such defense (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees, other professionals\' and experts\' fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which the Indemnified Person may seek indemnity pursuant to a Claim made by any Indemnified Person hereunder. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Indemnifying Person does not affect any privilege relating to the Indemnified Person, and may participate in settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-Party Claim. No Company Indemnified Person shall enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of Parent, and no Parent Indemnified Person shall enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Representative, as the case may be, (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), _provided_ , that if the Representative shall have consented in writing to any such settlement, then the Representative shall have no power or authority to object to any Claim by any Parent Indemnified Person for indemnity under Section 11.2 for the amount of such settlement; and the Company Shareholders will remain responsible to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons for all Damages they may incur arising out of, resulting from or caused by the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in Article 11\. 

  

  

 11.7 _ Contents of Notice of Claim._ Each Notice of Claim given pursuant to Section 11.5 will contain the following information: 

  

  

 (a) that the Indemnified Person has incurred, paid or properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or, in good faith, believes it will have to incur, pay or properly accrue (in accordance with GAAP), Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of Damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any Indemnified Person based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Indemnified Person under Article 11); and 

  

 (b) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnified Person\'s good faith belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant and copies of any formal demand or complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred, paid or accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related. 

  

  

 11.8 _ Resolution of Notice of Claim._ Each Notice of Claim will be resolved as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _ Uncontested Claims._ In the event that, within twenty business days after a Notice of Claim is received by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnifying Person does not contest such Notice of Claim in writing to the Indemnified Person as provided in Section 11.8(b) (an " _Uncontested Claim_ "), Parent or the Representative, on behalf of all Company Shareholders, as the case may be, will be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnified Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article 11, including the forfeiture of Hold-Back Cash Consideration to the extent applicable and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages against the Indemnifying Person for such amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper. 

  

    

  (b) _ Contested Claims._ In the event that the Indemnifying Person
gives the Indemnified Person written notice contesting all or any portion of
a Notice of Claim (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within the twenty business day
period specified in Section 11.8(a), then such Contested Claim will be
resolved by either (A) a written settlement agreement executed by the Parent
Indemnified Person and the Representative, or by Parent and the
Representative, as the case may be, or (B) in the absence of such a written
settlement agreement, by binding arbitration between the Parent Indemnified
Person and the Representative or Parent and the Representative, as the case
may be, in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 11.8(c).

  

 (c) _ Arbitration of Contested Claims._ Each of Parent, Company and the Company Shareholders agree that any Contested Claim will be submitted for settlement to mandatory, final and binding arbitration in San Jose, California and, except as herein specifically stated in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA Rules_ ") then in effect. However, in all events, these arbitration provisions will govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a Contested Claim. The parties covenant that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share in its costs in accordance with subparagraph (i) below. The provisions of this Section 11.8(c) may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement will be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. 

     

 (i) _Payment of Costs._ Parent on the one hand, and Company Shareholders (through the Representative), on the other hand, will bear the expense of deposits and advances required by the arbitrator in equal proportions, but either party may advance such amounts, subject to recovery as an addition or offset to any award. The arbitrator shall determine the party who is the prevailing party and the party who is the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by the prevailing party, the fees of the arbitrator and the administrative fee of the arbitration proceedings. 

  

 (ii) _Compensation of Arbitrator._ Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the parties or by the American Arbitration Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation. 

  

 (iii) _Selection of Arbitrator._ The American Arbitration Association will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who are lawyers familiar with California contract law; provided, however, that such lawyers cannot work for a firm then performing services for either party, that each party will have the opportunity to make such reasonable objection to any of the arbitrators listed as such party may wish and that the American Arbitration Association will select the arbitrator from the list of arbitrators as to whom neither party makes any such objection. In the event that the foregoing procedure is not followed, each party will choose one person from the list of arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association (provided that such person does not have a conflict of interest), and the two persons so selected will select from the list provided by the American Arbitration Association the person who will act as the arbitrator. 

    

      

  (iv) _Burden of Proof._ Except as may be otherwise expressly provided
herein, for any Contested Claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof
will be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding
governed by California law exclusively.

  

 (v) _Award._ Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a final written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached (the " _Final Award_ ") and will deliver such documents to the Representative and Parent, together with a signed copy of the Final Award. The Final Award will constitute a conclusive determination of all issues in question, binding upon the Company Shareholders, the Representative and Parent, and will include an affirmative statement to such effect. 

  

 (vi) _Timing._ The Representative, Parent and the arbitrator will conclude each arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.8 as promptly as possible for the Contested Claim being arbitrated. 

  

 (vii) _Terms of Arbitration._ The arbitrator chosen in accordance with
these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect
the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 (viii) _Exclusive Remedy._ Following the Effective Time, except as
specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, arbitration conducted in
accordance with this Agreement will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties for any Contested Claim made pursuant to Article 11\.

    

 

    
ARTICLE 12 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 

  

 12.1 _ Governing Law._ The internal laws of the State of California, irrespective of its choice of law principles, will govern the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto and issues involving the consummation and effects of the Merger. 

  

 12.2 _ Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns._ Neither party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Any assignment in violation of this provision shall be void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 12.3 _ Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, will for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 12.4 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be an original as regards any party whose signature appears thereon and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement will become binding when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, will bear the signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories. 

  

 12.5 _ Other Remedies._ Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event 

    that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction.

  

 12.6 _ Amendment and Waivers._ Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto as provided in this Section at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders, but, after such approval, no amendment will be made which by applicable law requires the further approval of the Company Shareholders without obtaining such further approval. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and Parent, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension will be effective unless signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof will not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions. 

  

 12.7 _ Expenses._ Each party will bear its respective legal, auditors\', investment bankers\' and financial advisors\' fees and other expenses paid or incurred with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transaction Expenses_ "); provided, however, that if the Merger is successfully consummated, then Parent will pay (i) at Closing, provided an invoice is delivered to Parent two business days prior to Closing or (ii) otherwise promptly upon demand such Transaction Expenses incurred by Company up to and including $1,500,000 and Parent will thereafter be entitled to indemnification from the Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 11.2 for an amount equal to the amount by which such Transaction Expenses exceed $1,500,000 (such excess amount, " _Excess Transaction Expenses_ ") to the extent such Excess Transaction Expenses have not been deducted from the Initial Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys\' fees, incurred in relation to any filings under the HSR Act. 

  

 12.8 _ Attorneys\' Fees._ Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any part of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover, as an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys\' fees to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal). The prevailing party will be entitled to recover its costs of suit, regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment. 

  

 12.9 _ Notices._ All notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and will be either hand delivered in person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier service.

 12.16 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the Exhibits hereto constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with respect hereto. The express terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof. 

   

 12.17 _ Waiver Of Jury Trial._ EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
