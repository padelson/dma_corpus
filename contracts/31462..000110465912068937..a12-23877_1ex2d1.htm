Transaction Costs, Final Closing Tax Amount, and Final Working Capital Surplus
or Final Working Capital Deficiency, as set forth in a written notice

this Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and shall

Value) to Parent pursuant to the joint instruction of the Representative and
Parent within five (5) days of the determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount. If the Final Adjustment Deficiency is greater than the amount in the
Escrow Fund, then neither the Representative nor the Stockholders shall be
liable to Parent or any of its Affiliates for any amount by which the Final
Adjustment Deficiency is greater than the amount in the Escrow Fund. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that any amounts included in the determination of the
Final Adjustment Surplus or Final Adjustment Deficiency may not be included

of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of the Retained Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Retained Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of
anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity pertaining to
any act or omission occurring or existing prior to the Effective Time and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" ** _D
andO Indemnified Liabilities_**"), in each case to the fullest extent the
Surviving Corporation is permitted under the TBOC to indemnify its own
directors or officers (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Indemnifiable DandO
Claim to each DandO Indemnified Person to the fullest extent the Surviving
Corporation is permitted under the TBOC to advance expenses to its directors
or officers in connection with any such Indemnifiable DandO Claim). In
determining whether a DandO Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 5.2(a)_, if requested by such DandO Indemnified Person,
such determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by
the DandO Indemnified Person and approved by the Surviving Corporation (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event any such Indemnifiable DandO Claim is brought against any DandO
Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the DandO Indemnified Persons may retain the Companys regularly engaged
independent legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the DandO Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ that in connection with an Indemnifiable

 



      
 

 



 

DandO Claim involving multiple DandO Indemnified Persons the Company shall only be
required to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for all such
DandO Indemnified Persons, except to the extent that conflicts of interest
require the engagement of separate counsel for one or more of the DandO
Indemnified Persons, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter. Any DandO Indemnified Person
claiming indemnification under this _Section 5.2(a)_, upon learning of any
such Indemnifiable DandO Claim, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability that it may
have under this _Section 5.2(a)_ except to the extent such failure prejudices
such partys position with respect to such claims) and shall deliver to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 8.104 of
the TBOC, but without any requirement for the posting of a bond or any other
terms or conditions other than those expressly set forth herein.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any DandO Indemnified Person
against all reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
_Section 5.2(a)_, relating to the enforcement of such DandO Indemnified
Persons rights under this _Section 5.2_ or under any charter, bylaw or
contract regardless of whether such DandO Indemnified Person is ultimately
determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
covering the DandO Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary
liability insurance policies on terms not materially less favorable to such
DandO Indemnified Persons than such existing insurance, which policies shall
provide insurance coverage for six (6) years after the Closing Date with
respect to the actions or omissions of the DandO Indemnified Persons prior to
the Closing Date. In the event that any Person is or would have been entitled
to coverage under an officers and directors liability or fiduciary liability
insurance policy pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ and such policy has lapsed,
not been purchased, terminated or is otherwise in breach or default or affords
lesser coverage than is required by this _Section 5.2_ as a result of the
Companys, Parents or the Surviving Corporations failure to maintain and
fulfill its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ or for any other
reason, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall pay
to such Persons such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as
such Persons would have received pursuant to such policies.

 



 

(d) Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Retained Subsidiaries not to, amend, repeal, or otherwise modify their
respective charters, bylaws or other organizational documents, or revoke any
resolutions previously adopted by their boards or other governing bodies, in a
manner that would eliminate the rights of any individuals who at the Closing
were DandO Indemnified Persons to seek indemnification from the Surviving
Corporation or the Retained Subsidiaries (as applicable) for claims asserted
against such individuals by third Persons, other than Excluded DandO Claims.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.2_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives.

under the applicable Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company shall keep each
other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
Governmental Authority with whom a filing has been made pursuant to Antitrust
Laws.

 



 

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the

Bonus Plan shall contain a 280G Waiver in accordance with _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _6.8(b)_ hereof. Subject to the foregoing proviso, the aggregate amount
payable, timing of the Bonus Plan Participation Payments and other terms of
the Bonus Plan shall be determined in the discretion of the Company, subject
to approval by Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

later than twenty four (24) months following the Closing Date. Parent
acknowledges that the Company will, in its sole discretion, be entitled to
designate the Persons entitled to participate in the Plan and the amounts
payable to each participant. Parent and the Company will coordinate with each
other in a good faith effort to establish a structure which accomplishes the
goal of rewarding the participants but without creating any adverse
consequences to Parent.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Company to pay to each Bonus Plan Participant any
and all amounts due and owed such Bonus Plan Participant pursuant to the Bonus
Plan, less any withholding required by Applicable Laws.

delivered by the Parent or the Company to the Representatives by wire transfer
of immediately available funds within ten (10) days after the last Business
Day of the quarter in which the participant ceases to be a "qualified
participant."

 



 

 **6.3 _Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Merger Subsidiary; No Other
Representations or Warranties_**.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that it has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries and
its and their businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary have
been furnished with or given full access to such information about the Company
and the Retained Subsidiaries and its and their businesses and operations as
they requested. In connection with Parents and Merger Subsidiarys
investigation of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries and its and their
businesses and operations, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective
representatives have received from the Company or its representatives certain
projections and other forecasts for the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries
and certain estimates, plans and budget information. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets;
(ii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary are familiar with such uncertainties; and
(iii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary are taking full responsibility for making
their own evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or their
representatives.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set
forth in _Section 3.1_ of this Agreement, none of the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, any Stockholder, or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives has made and shall not be deemed to have made to any of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or representatives
any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that none of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company,

 



      
 

 



 

any Stockholder, or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives
makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or to any of their respective representatives or Affiliates with respect to:

 



 

(i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenue,

thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available

Affiliates; or

 



 

(ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their
respective representatives or Affiliates, including the information contained

expressly covered by representations and warranties made by the Company and
set forth in _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary as expressly set forth in
_Section 3.2_, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives makes or has made to any of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, any Stockholder, or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives any representation or warranty of any kind.

 



 

 **6.4 _Waiver_**. Parent hereby waives, and agrees to cause the Company and
the Surviving Corporation to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with (a) Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. representing all or any of the Stockholders or
the Representative following the Closing and (b) the communications by such
counsel to the Stockholders or the Representative in connection with any such
representation, any fact known to such counsel, including in connection with a
dispute with Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation on or following
the Closing.

 



 

 **6.5 _Restructuring_**. The Company shall complete the Restructuring
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and
procedures described in _Section 1.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_
or otherwise in a manner reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall have
provided to Parent such evidence of the structure, terms and completion
thereof as Parent shall reasonably request. In connection with the
Restructuring, the Company shall cause the Excluded Subsidiaries to (a) except
for the Contracts and transactions specified in _Section 1.1(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ as expressly not being terminated, terminate each
Contract and transaction between the Company or a Retained Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and an Excluded Subsidiary, on the other hand, with no ongoing
Liability or obligation of the Company or any Retained Subsidiary, and (b)
enter into a written undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold the Surviving
Corporation and the Retained Subsidiaries harmless for all Excluded
Subsidiaries Legacy Liabilities and Restructuring Liabilities, to the extent
any such Liabilities are not included in the Closing Adjustment Amount, in
each case pursuant to documentation that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the Excluded Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **6.6 _Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any Retained Subsidiary
shall, and prior to the sixty-first (61st) day following the Closing Date,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not implement any plant closing,
mass layoff or other termination of employees

 



      
 

 



 

which, either alone or in the aggregate (with each other and/or with any plant
closing, mass layoff or other termination of employees by the Company or the
Retained Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date), would create any
obligations upon or liabilities for Parent, the Company or any Stockholders
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar
Applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, if the Company or Parent
terminates any employee of the Company or its Affiliates involved in the
Business (" ** _Business Employee_** ") without cause under the Companys
severance plan, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide to such
employee the severance benefits to which such employee is entitled under the
terms of such plan at the time of termination. No severance shall be paid in
connection with the termination of any employee listed on _Section 1.1(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(c) If Parent elects to move any of the Business Employees into Parents or
its Affiliates (other than the Company or any Retained Subsidiary) Employee
Benefit Plans (the " ** _Parent Benefit Plans_** "), Parent shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to recognize the period of employment of each Business
Employee with the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries for purposes of
determining any such Business Employees credited service for eligibility to
participate in, and vesting under, all of Parents and its Affiliates plans,
programs and policies in which such Business Employee is eligible (other than
any equity or retiree medical or welfare plans), including determining the
participation level of vacation pay, credited service for medical benefits and
level of severance pay. Further, upon moving a Business Employee into any
Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall, subject to the provisions and eligibility
rules of Parents plans, (i) waive any pre-existing conditions to the extent
such conditions would be waived for other plan participants with similar
credited service, and (ii) credit the expenses of such Business Employees that
were credited toward deductibles or out-of-pocket limits for each Companys
plan year up to the Effective Time under the applicable employee benefit plan
of the Company or its Affiliates against satisfaction of any deductibles or
out-of-pocket limits for the Parents plan year from the Closing Date under
the applicable Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

 **6.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_**. The Company agrees to terminate, or cause
to be terminated, at no cost to the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries, any
Tax sharing, Tax allocation agreement, Tax indemnity, or any similar written
or unwritten agreement, arrangement, understanding, or practice relating to
Taxes involving the Company or any of the Retained Subsidiaries as of the day
before the date of Closing provided under _Section 8.1_, and, on and after
the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

 **6.8 _Stockholder Meeting_**.

 



 

(a) Following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall duly take all
lawful action required to call, give notice, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Stockholders (the " ** _Company Stockholders Meeting_** ") no
later than December 12, 2012 (with notice of such meeting not being sent
before November 6, 2012) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and will take all lawful action to solicit and obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. The board of directors of the Company will, in such
meeting notice, recommend adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders to
the effect as set forth in _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_. Parent shall have a
reasonable right of prior review and comment with respect to any
communications by the Company to the Stockholders in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting, including proxy solicitation materials and
disclosure and other materials related to Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. In connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock, the
Company shall (on behalf of the Parent and without any responsibility for the
contents thereof) distribute such disclosure materials to the Stockholders as
provided by the Parent for delivery to the Stockholders, as instructed by
Parent.

 



 

(b) Additionally, the Company shall take all steps necessary in compliance
with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, including (x) executing or adopting, as applicable, a 280G Waiver
(as defined below) with respect to each Potential Parachute Payment (or
portion thereof) to be subjected to a Stockholder vote in connection with
clause (z) hereof, (y) providing adequate disclosure to Stockholders and (z)
conducting a vote of all Stockholders (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-7(b)) so that in the event the Stockholder
approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(i) of the Code are met in
connection with such Stockholder vote, no amount, economic benefit or other
entitlement that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting
thereof and including but not limited to any amount payable under the Bonus
Plan or any Change in Control Payment) as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether alone or in combination with any other event) by
any Person who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company (each such amount,
benefit or other entitlement, a " ** _Potential Parachute Payment_** ") would
be treated as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of
the Code, and determined without regard to whether or not such Stockholder
approval requirements are actually met in connection with such Stockholder
vote). In connection with the foregoing, (i) the determination of which
payments may be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (as defined in
Section 280G(b) of the Code), (ii) the form of any agreement or provision in
any Employee Benefit Plan or other agreement that (in order to satisfy the
requirement under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-7(b)(1))
irrevocably waives or conditions the right of a disqualified individual to
receive or retain, all or any portion of any Potential Parachute Payment
payable pursuant to such plan or agreement that, together with any other
Potential Parachute Payments payable to such disqualified individual, equals
or exceeds three (3) times such individuals "base amount" (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-34) (each such agreement or
provision, a " ** _280G_** **_Waiver_** ") and (iii) the disclosure and other
circumstances of such Stockholder approval (including all documents to be
delivered to the Stockholders) shall, in each case, be provided to Parent
sufficiently in advance of the aforementioned Stockholder vote to allow for
meaningful advance review and comment by Parent and shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. Promptly after the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
that the aforementioned Stockholder approval was solicited, and, if obtained,
evidence of the same in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt (as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1,
Q/A-7(b)(1)), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not be contingent or
otherwise conditioned upon the Stockholder approval of any Potential Parachute
Payments (or portions thereof) solicited pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)_.
For purposes of this _Section 6.8(b)_, "Stockholder" means any Person who is
a "shareholder" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

 **6.9 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts and Transactions_**. Prior to the
Closing, unless otherwise instructed by Parent in writing and except as
provided in _Schedule 6.9_ , the Company shall, and shall cause each Retained
Subsidiary to, (a) terminate each Contract and transaction set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 3.1(t)_ , including the repayments of any loans
to or from any Stockholder or any director, officer or employee of the Company
or any Retained Subsidiary and (b) settle all intercompany accounts receivable
and accounts payable (excluding ordinary course expense reimbursements and
401k loans) between the Company or any Retained Subsidiary, on one hand, and
any Related Person or

 



      
 

 



 

employee of the Company or a Retained Subsidiary, on the other hand, in each
case pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and with no
ongoing Liability or obligation of the Company or any Retained Subsidiary.

 



 

 **6.10 _Termination of Guarantees and Other Debt Obligations_**. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each Retained Subsidiary to,
terminate and be fully released from any Liability under any guaranty of the
indebtedness of another Person (other than the Company or a Retained
Subsidiary), including any guaranty listed in _Company Disclosure Schedule
3.1(q)_ , in each case pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. Additionally, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Retained Subsidiary to, terminate and be fully released from any
Liability under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement between the Company and Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., dated as of September 30, 2011, pursuant to documentation
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 



 

 **6.11 _Delivery of Certificates and Letters of Transmittal_**. No later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent the Certificates and Letters of Transmittal then in its possession.

 



 

 **6.12 _Tax Returns; Restructuring Appraisals; Cooperation Agreement;
Refunds_**.

 



 

(a) Parent shall prepare and timely file (taking into account any applicable
extensions), or shall be caused to be prepared and timely filed (taking into
account any applicable extensions), any and all Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company or any Retained Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
which are required to be filed after the Closing Date (each, a " ** _Pre-
Closing Tax Return_** "), and each such Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past custom and practice except as
otherwise required by Applicable Law or fact. Parent shall utilize UHY
Advisors TX, LLC to assist in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Tax Return
which is the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date. Parent shall
provide a copy of each Pre-Closing Tax Return to the Representatives for the
Representatives review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (taking into account any applicable extension) of such Pre-Closing Tax
Return. Parent shall consider in good faith and shall incorporate any
reasonable comments with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Return provided in
writing by the Representatives to Parent at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date (taking into account any applicable extension) of such Pre-
Closing Tax Return; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to make any
changes that it determines in good faith are not more likely than not correct.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto recognize that the Restructuring Tax Liability will be
determined in part based upon the fair market value of the Companys assets
being distributed to its stockholders (the " ** _Distributed Assets_** ") and
the Companys tax basis in the Distributed Assets. The Company agrees that at
least thirty (30) days before the Closing Date it will provide to Parent (i)
appraisals of the fair market value of the Distributed Assets (the " **
_Appraisals_** ") obtained from Tharpe and Company and Deloitte LLP (the " **
_Appraisers_** ") and (ii) the U.S. federal income tax basis of the
Distributed Assets. The Company shall certify to Parent that the Appraisals
include the fair market value of all the Distributed Assets. Parent (or its
representatives or advisors) shall be entitled to review the Appraisals to
reasonably determine the accuracy of such Appraisals by confirming the
accuracy and the factual and economic basis underlying the Appraisals with the
Appraisers and shall be granted access to the Appraisers records with respect
to the Appraisals. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit or alter a
Parent Indemnified Persons ability to seek indemnity for any Restructuring
Tax Liability pursuant to _Section 10.1_ in the event it is determined
additional Taxes are due with respect to the Restructuring.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In connection with the Restructuring, the Company shall enter into a
written agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) with
the parent entity to be distributed by the Company to the Stockholders in the
Restructuring (" ** _Spinco_** ") obligating Spinco (and its Affiliates) to
cooperate fully with the Company (and its Affiliates), and to provide the
Company (and its Affiliates) with such assistance as the Company may
reasonably request, in connection with the preparation of any Pre-Closing Tax
Return or in connection with any audit, investigation, or other examination by
a Governmental Authority or any judicial or administrative proceeding relating
to Taxes of the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries or Taxes for which the
Company or the Retained Subsidiaries may be liable.

 



 

(d) Any Refundable Taxes that are received by (or reduce the Tax Liability of)
Parent, the Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing Date shall be for the account of the
Stockholders. Parent shall pay, or cause the Company or a Retained Subsidiary
to pay, any such Refundable Taxes to the Representatives within thirty (30)
days after any such Refundable Taxes are received (or used to reduce Tax
Liability).

 



 

 **6.13 _Inventory Count_**. At Parents request, the Company shall permit
Parent or its representatives to conduct a physical inventory count within the
thirty (30) day period preceding the anticipated Closing Date at (a) any
facility of the Company or any Retained Subsidiary that, based on the
Companys or the Retained Subsidiaries records, maintains $5,000,000 or more
of inventory, and (b) if the facilities described in clause (a) do not
represent in the aggregate seventy percent (70%) of the inventory of the
Company and its Retained Subsidiaries, at such additional facilities of the
Company and the Retained Subsidiaries mutually identified by the parties, such
that the physical inventory counts cover facilities that maintain in the
aggregate seventy percent (70%) of the inventory of the Company and the
Retained Subsidiaries. Any physical inventory count conducted by Parent or its
representatives shall be conducted in accordance with customary industry
standards and in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Company, may be
observed by representatives of the Company, and the results of such physical
inventory count shall be used to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and
determine the Estimated Working Capital Surplus or Estimated Working Capital
Deficiency, as applicable, and to prepare the Final Balance Sheet and
determine the Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital
Deficiency, as applicable.

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

 



 

(i) if there shall have been any material breach by the other party (which, in
the case of the right of termination by the Company, shall also include any
breach by Merger Subsidiary) of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the

terminate this Agreement under this _clause (ii)_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date.

 



 

 **9.2 _Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become

such termination shall relieve any party from liability for breach of any term
or provision hereof.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ due to the inability to obtain any required approval
under any applicable Antitrust Law, then, (i) so long as the inability to
obtain such required approval was not due to a breach of this Agreement by the
Company and (ii) as of April 15, 2013, all conditions in _Section 7.2_ (other
than _Section 7.2(c)_ but which shall be capable of satisfaction at such time)

(c) The portion of Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period that are allocated
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be determined as
follows:

 



 

(i) In the case of any real property, personal property, ad valorem and

deemed to be the amount of such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period,

of which is the number of total days in the entire Straddle Period; and

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Tax that is based on income, sales, revenue,
production or similar items, or other Taxes not described in _Section
10.1(c)(i)_ , the amount any such Tax that is attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of and including the Closing Date; _provided, however_
, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be

 



      
 

 



 

allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period and the
remainder of such Straddle Period in proportion to the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period and the number of days in the
remainder of such Straddle Period.

 



 

 **10.2 _Indemnification of Stockholders_**. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article X_ , Parent agrees that, after the Effective Time, Parent and the

(a) any nonfulfillment or breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any
covenant or agreement under this Agreement made by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary;

 



 

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach by the Surviving Corporation of any covenant
or agreement of the Company under this Agreement that is required to be

contemplated by this Agreement; or

 



 

(d) any claim or allegation with respect to any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **10.3 _Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parent Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to be indemnified for, and the
Stockholders will not be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Parent Indemnified Persons from and against Damages pursuant to _Section 10.1_
other than from the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parent Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to be indemnified for, and the
Company Stockholders will not be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Parent Indemnified Persons from and against, Damages (i) pursuant
to _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ unless and until (A) the amount of such Damages for
any single event or occurrence or any aggregated claims arising out of the
same or related facts, events or circumstances exceeds $100,000 (the " ** _Per
Claim Threshold_** "), and (B) the aggregate Damages so determined to be due
for which the Parent Indemnified Persons seek or have sought indemnification
hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate of $20,000,000 (the " ** _Basket_**
"), in which event the Parent Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other
limitations herein, be indemnified for the full amount of such Damages from
the first dollar without regard to the Basket, and (ii) pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)(i)(B)_ unless and until the aggregate Damages so determined to be due
for which the Parent Indemnified Persons seek or have sought indemnification
under Section _10.1(a)(i)(B)_ exceed a cumulative aggregate of $2,000,000 (the
" ** _Special Deductible_** "), and then only for amounts in excess of such
Special Deductible, which Damages applied toward satisfaction of the Special
Deductible shall not be applied toward satisfaction of the Basket; _provided,
however_ , that that the limitations contained in this _Section 10.3(b)_ shall
not apply to Damages resulting from any breach of the Company Fundamental
Representations. For purposes of determining whether product warranty claims
reach the Per Claim Threshold, the parties acknowledge and agree that product
warranty and

 



      
 

 



 

product liability claims will be considered on a contract-by-contract basis
and not aggregated across contracts; _provided_ that product warranty and
product liability claims that arise out of the same set of facts or the same
or similar events, circumstances or occurrences (such as a product not meeting
contractual specifications that is sold to multiple customers) shall be
aggregated and treated as a single claim for purposes of determining whether
the Per Claim Threshold has been reached or exceeded.

 



 

(c) Any claim for indemnification made by an Indemnified Person under _Section
10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.2_ must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.4(a)_ no later than the applicable Expiration Date and, if so
raised by such date, such claim shall survive the applicable Expiration Date
until final resolution thereof.

 



 

(d) The amount to which an Indemnified Person may become entitled under this
_Article X_ shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by way of payment,
discount or credit received from a third party (including any insurer)) less
any cost associated with receiving such recovery, but, without limiting this
_Section 10.3(d)_ , an Indemnified Person shall not be required to seek or
collect such recoveries prior to being entitled to indemnification hereunder,
but, if any indemnity is paid before the Indemnified Person receives any such
recovery, then the Indemnified Person will promptly remit to the Surviving
Corporation or Representative, as applicable, the portion of the indemnity to
which it would not have been entitled if it had received such recovery prior
to the payment of such indemnity.

 



 

(e) Except with respect to the representation in _Section 3.1(g)(ii)_ , when
determining whether a representation or warranty contained herein has been
breached for purposes of _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ and the amount of
Damages arising out of or resulting from such breach, any Material Adverse
Effect qualifier, materiality qualifier, or similar qualifier, contained in
such representation or warranty (except for reference to Material Contracts)
will be disregarded.

 



 

(f) An Indemnitees knowledge before the Effective Time of the breach of any
representation or warranty or of the failure to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement for which such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall not affect such Indemnitees
right to indemnification under this _Article X_.

 



 

(g) Each Indemnitee shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken all
commercially reasonable steps, as it may determine, to mitigate its Damages
upon and after becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Article X_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein is intended to limit a
partys right to recovery for Fraud committed by the other party.

 



 

(i) No Parent Indemnified Person may assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder with respect to Damages resulting from or arising out of, or
attributable to, the coming into force of, or the change in, any applicable
Environmental Law (including any new or modified cleanup standard or
requirement for remedial work), on or after the Effective Time, but only to
the extent of any Liability that did not exist under applicable Environmental
Laws as in effect at the Effective Time.

 



 

(j) No Parent Indemnified Person may assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder to the extent the Damages result from or arise out of, or are
attributable to (i) any soil, ground water, surface water or soil sampling,
surveys, investigations, explorations, laboratory analysis or

 



      
 

 



 

testing which any Parent Indemnified Person voluntarily undertakes after the
Effective Time, excluding any such sampling, surveys, investigations,
explorations, laboratory analysis or testing that are required by any
Environmental Law (including any self-reporting obligation) or the unsolicited
direction of any Governmental Authority, or (ii) environmental liabilities
discovered by a Governmental Authority as a proximate result of an officer,
employee or representative of Parent or Parents Affiliates voluntary
notifications to, or voluntary communications or interactions with such
Governmental Authority on or after the Effective Time other than notices or
reports that are required to be made under applicable Environmental Laws
(including any self-reporting obligations); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing limitations in this _Section 10.3(j)_ shall not prevent or limit a
claim for indemnification hereunder to the extent that the sampling, survey,
investigation, exploration, analysis, testing, notification, communication or
interaction was based upon (A) Parents reasonable interpretation of a
recommendation or indication of non-compliance with Environmental Laws
contained or described in an ERM Report, (B) Parents reasonable conclusion
that the known facts, circumstances and available evidence indicate that a
violation of Environmental Laws is reasonably likely to exist or (C) Parents,
the Companys or any Retained Subsidiarys discovery of a potential non-
compliance with Environmental Laws while engaged in activities in the ordinary
course of its business.

 



 

(k) Without limitation of the obligation of the Parent Indemnified Persons to
minimize Damages subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and
subject to the other limitations on indemnification obligations set forth in
this _Section 10.3_ , the Parent Indemnified Persons right to indemnification
for Damages arising from any breach of the Companys representations and
warranties in _Section 3.1(o)_ of this Agreement (relating to Environmental
Matters) shall be limited with respect to remediation costs to only include
costs for commercially reasonable, cost-effective remedies (including
consideration of risk-based standards) that would be employed by a reasonably
prudent operator acting without the benefit of indemnity.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
_Section 10.1(a)(i)_ for environmental matters disclosed on the date of this
Agreement on _Section 3.1(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_
(Environmental Matters) to the extent the amount of such Damages exceeds a
cumulative aggregate of $10,000,000 (the " ** _Environmental Deductible_** "),
and then only for amounts in excess of such Environmental Deductible,
_provided_ that Damages for environmental matters disclosed on _Section 3.1(o)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ in excess of the Environmental Deductible
shall be applied toward satisfaction of the Basket in _Section 10.3(b)_ and
otherwise be indemnified in accordance with _Section 10.1(a)(i)_.

 



 

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of the
Escrow Fund for costs actually incurred and paid by the Company on or before
the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing with respect to matters disclosed
on the date of this Agreement on _Section 3.1(u)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ (Corruption and Proceeds of Crime) to the extent the amount of such
costs exceeds a cumulative aggregate amount of $500,000 (the " ** _Compliance
Deductible_** "), and then only for amounts in excess of such Compliance
Deductible, _provided_ that such costs in excess of the Compliance Deductible
shall first be applied against the Basket in _Section 10.3(b)_ , and only
after the amount of the Basket is reached will the Parent Indemnified Person
be entitled to reimbursement for such costs in excess of the Compliance
Deductible out of the Escrow Fund. Parent Indemnified Persons shall have no
right to indemnification under this _Section 10.3(m)_ or otherwise with
respect to the matters disclosed on _Section 3.1(u)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ except for reimbursement of costs out of the Escrow Fund
in accordance with this _Section 10.3(m)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.4 _Notice of Claim_**.

 



 

(a) As used herein the term " ** _Claim_** " means a claim for indemnification
by any Parent Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person (acting
solely through the Representative), as the case may be, for Damages under this
_Article X_ (such Person making a Claim, an " ** _Indemnitee_** "). An
Indemnitee may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its
own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Parent Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such
Claim executed by an officer or authorized Person of Parent (in the case of a
Claim by an Parent Indemnified Person) or the Representative (in the case of a
Claim by a Seller Indemnified Person) (in either case, a " ** _Notice of
Claim_** "), and delivered to the other of them (such receiving party, the "
** _Indemnitor_** "), after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of
any potential Claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under this _Article
X_ but in any event before the applicable Expiration Date, if any, arising out
of or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.1_ or _10.2_ ;
or

 



 

(ii) the assertion, in writing, against any Indemnitee of a claim or
Proceeding brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case,
a " ** _Third-Party Claim_** ") that arises out of or results from any item
indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.1_ or _10.2_.

 



 

(b) Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall contain a brief description,
in reasonable detail, of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the
alleged Damages based on the Indemnitees good faith belief thereof, including
the identity of any third-party claimant and, if reasonably estimable, the
amount of such Damages. Following delivery of the Notice of Claim (or at the
same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall deliver copies of
any demand or complaint it shall receive from any third party and, reasonably
promptly after such information becomes available to it, the amount of
Damages, the date each such item was incurred or paid, the basis for such
liability and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related.

 



 

 **10.5 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to defend
any Third-Party Claim, and, as provided by _Section 10.7_ , the costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense (including
attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs) shall be paid by the Indemnitor.

 



 

(b) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim
to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , that, so long as such notice is given on or
prior to the applicable Expiration Date, the failure to timely give the Notice
of Claim shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity
hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor (or the
Stockholders, in the case of a Notice of Claim by an Parent Indemnified
Person) is actually prejudiced thereby through the forfeiture by the
Indemnitor of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnitor with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume
the defense thereof, including to settle such Third-Party Claim subject to the
requirements of _Section 10.5(d)_ , utilizing legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall: (i) notify Indemnitee within 20 days of
receipt of the Notice of Claim that it will defend such Third-Party Claim;
(ii) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence
and act affirmatively to keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material
developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (iii) promptly
submit to the Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings,
motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in
connection therewith; (iv) promptly respond to all reasonable requests by
Indemnitee relating thereto and otherwise permit the Indemnitee and its
counsel to participate in, but not control, the conduct of the defense
thereof; and (v) to the extent practicable in the circumstances, permit the
Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity to review and comment upon all legal
papers to be submitted prior to their submission. Parent and the
Representative will make available to each other and each others counsel and
accountants, without charge (other than any applicable third-party costs), all
of its or their books and records (or portions thereof) relating to the Third-
Party Claim, and each Party will render to the other Party such assistance as
may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper and adequate defense
thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may
be reasonably requested by the other Party in connection therewith, with any
expenses of Indemnitee with respect thereto being included in Indemnitees
Damages. The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall use their reasonable best
efforts, at the sole cost and expense of Indemnitor, to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable law and subject to a
Partys right to waive its own privilege), and seek to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any Party to a
Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges. Once the Indemnitor has made the election to
defend as set forth above, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its sole
cost and expense; _provided_ , that if (i) the Indemnitee shall have been
advised by counsel in writing that there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnitee that are not available to, or in conflict with, those of the
Indemnitor, (ii) the Indemnitor shall authorize the Indemnitee in writing to
employ separate counsel at the Indemnitors expense or (iii) the Indemnitor is
not actively and reasonably diligently defending such Third Party Claim with
legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee, then the expenses of such
separate counsel shall be considered Damages. The assumption of the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim by the Indemnitor shall be an acknowledgement of
the obligation of the Indemnitor to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to
such Claim hereunder. If the Indemnitor declines or fails to assume the
defense of the Third-Party Claim on the terms provided above, in any case
within 20 days after receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to undertake the defense of such Claim with counsel of its own
choosing and the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the
Indemnitee for such counsel will be included in the Indemnitees Damages;
_provided, however_ , that no such compromise or settlement shall be binding
on the issue of whether, or the extent to which, the Indemnitee may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to enter into any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim on the Indemnitees behalf without the
consent of the Indemnitee, unless (i) in the case of a Claim by an Parent
Indemnified Person, the amount to be paid by the Indemnitee as a result of
such settlement does not exceed the Escrow Fund (after taking into account any
other outstanding Claims), (ii) such settlement does not involve any finding
or admission suggesting any violation of law or other wrongdoing or any
injunctive or other form of non-monetary relief binding upon the Indemnitee or
any of its Affiliates, officers, directors and agents, other than reasonable
confidentiality obligations related to the terms of such settlement, and (iii)
such settlement

 



   

     
 

 



 

expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee and its Affiliates and
such other Persons from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Claim, and includes the giving by the claimant to the Indemnitee of a release
in respect thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, of any further liability, at law, in equity or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to
compromise or enter into settlement with respect to any Third-Party Claim
pertaining to Taxes if such compromise or settlement could adversely affect a
Tax position of the Indemnitee (or any Affiliate of the Indemnitee) without
the consent of the Indemnitee.

 



 

 **10.6 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_**. Each Notice of Claim given by an
Indemnitee, other than with respect to Third-Party Claims resolved in
accordance with _Section 10.6_ , shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) _Admitted Claims_. If, within 20 Business Days after a Notice of Claim is
delivered to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing (i) that
liability for such Claim is indemnified under this _Article X_ and (ii) to the
full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor
(on behalf of the Stockholders if the Representative is the Indemnitor) shall
be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnitee of
the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim.

 



 

(b) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnitor does not so agree in writing to such
Notice of Claim or gives the other Party written notice contesting all or any
portion of a Notice of Claim (a " ** _Contested Claim_** ") within the 20
Business Day period specified in _Section 10.6(a)_ , then such Contested Claim
shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by
Parent and the Representative or (ii) in the absence of such a written
settlement agreement, by a Proceeding brought in a court designated in
_Section 11.18_. The resolution of any Contested Claim pursuant to this
_Section 10.6(b)_ is referred to as a " ** _Final Award_**."

 



 

(c) _Payment to Parent_. If any Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to the
recovery of Damages pursuant to any Claim that is agreed to pursuant to
_Section 10.6(a)_ , or a Contested Claim that is finally resolved pursuant to
_Section 10.6(b)_ , Parent and the Representative shall execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing that the Escrow Agent
disburse from the Escrow Fund shares or cash (as directed by Parent and
reflected in the joint written instruction) in an amount necessary to satisfy
the Damages arising out of or resulting from such Claim or such Contested
Claim as so determined.

 



 

 **10.7** ** ****_Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_**.

 



 

(a) All representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement, as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the
Closing, remain operative and in full force and effect until that date which
is the earliest of (i) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article X_ and (ii) April 30, 2014; _provided_ that the Company Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.1(h)_
(Compliance with Laws), _3.1(o)_ (Environmental Matters), _3.1(p)_ (Taxes),
_3.1(u)_ (Corruption and Proceeds of Crime) and _3.1(v)_ (Trade Controls and
U.S. Sanctions) will survive the Closing for twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) All representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
contained in this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All covenants of the Parties to be performed following the Closing shall
survive the Closing without time limit until performed except as may otherwise
be expressly provided herein. The applicable date on which a representation,
warranty, covenant or indemnity terminates, expires or otherwise ceases to be
operative and in full force and effect, as provided in this _Section 10.7_ ,
is referred to in this Agreement as the " ** _Expiration Date_**."

 



 

 **10.8** ** ****_Exclusive Remedy; Non-Recourse_**.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 2.11_ and except for claims arising out of
Fraud, after the Effective Time, the indemnification rights in this _Article
X_ are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Indemnified
Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties, for itself, its successors and assigns (including the
Surviving Corporation), acknowledges and agrees that they shall have no
recourse for or on account of any matter, cause, claim or thing of or relating
to this Agreement or the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby,
except to the extent permitted under this _Article X_. From and after the
Effective Time, each Party, for itself, its successors and assigns hereby
waives and releases any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be
based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any tort claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), other than claims or causes of action arising out
of Fraud.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 10.8_ shall
not apply to any claims by Parent or the Surviving Corporation under the Non-
Competition Agreements or to any action or claim by any Party for specific
performance or injunctive relief with respect to any failure by any other
Party to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or
any claims or causes of actions for Fraud.

 



 

(d) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be
brought against the entities that are expressly named as Parties and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
Party. Except to the extent a named Party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this
Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any Party hereto shall have any liability
for any obligations or liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

 **10.9** ** ****_Other Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED TO THE CONTRARY IN ANY OTHER PROVISION
OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES, AND THE RECOVERY BY A PARTY OR INDEMNITEE OF ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED
OR INCURRED BY IT AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH OR NONFULFILLMENT BY A PARTY OF
ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF FRAUD, BE
LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES DIRECTLY ARISING FROM SUCH BREACH
OR NONFULFILLMENT BUT NOT DAMAGES INDIRECTLY

 



      
 

 



 

ARISING FROM SUCH BREACH OR NONFULFILLMENT, AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE OR APPLY TO,
NOR SHALL ANY PARTY OR INDEMNITEE BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, ANY INDIRECT,
SPECULATIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY A
PARTY OR INDEMNITEE.

 



 

(b) For purposes of the foregoing, damages may include indirect, speculative,
remote, exemplary or punitive damages to the extent (i) the injuries or losses
resulting in or giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by a
third party who is not an Affiliate of a Party, and (ii) such damages are
recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person that is a third Party who is not
an Affiliate of a Party. This _Section 10.9_ shall operate only to limit a
Partys liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any contractual
obligation of a Party hereunder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **11.1** ** ****_Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_**. At and after the
Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Subsidiary, deeds, bills of sale, assignment or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm or record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

 



 

 **11.2** ** ****_Amendment and Modification_**. This Agreement may be amended
by the parties hereto, _provided_ that no amendment shall be made which by
Applicable Law requires further approval by a partys stockholders without
such further approval.

 



 

 **11.3** ** ****_Waiver of Compliance_**. Any failure of Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company (prior to Closing) to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition contained herein may be waived only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
by such waiver (including, if such waiver is after the Closing, the third-
party beneficiaries set forth in _Section 11.6_ ), but such waiver or failure
to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
other failure.

 



 

 **11.4** ** ****_Severability_**. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Applicable
Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Governmental Authority making such determination is authorized and instructed
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated herein are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **11.5** ** ****_Expenses and Obligations_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne solely and entirely by the party
that has incurred such expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If the transaction closes after December 31, 2012, then (i) so long as (A)
the inability to close was not due to a breach of this Agreement by the
Company and (B) either (1) the Company made the Second Request Certification
and the SIR Certification on or prior to the Antitrust Certification Date or
(2) Parent did not make the Second Request Certification and SIR Certification
on or prior to the Antitrust Certification Date and (ii) as of December 31,
2012, all conditions in _Section 7.2_ (other than _Section 7.2(c)_ but which
shall be capable of satisfaction at such time) were satisfied, Parent will pay
to the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) 50% of the incremental
tax burden imposed on such Stockholders (the " ** _Incremental Tax Burden_**
") in connection with this transaction, as a result of post-December 31
increases in applicable gains or investment taxes, including increases in
capital gains rates and Health Care Act-related increases, which become
effective after December 31, 2012. The Incremental Tax Burden applicable to
each Stockholder shall be calculated as the increased tax rates multiplied by
the value of the Closing Cash Consideration, Closing Stock Consideration and
Escrowed Stock Consideration, as adjusted by the terms of the Agreement,
received by such Stockholder pursuant to or in consideration of the Merger.
Such payments, if required, will be paid on or before January 31, 2014, based
on tax rates for 2013 as in effect on January 1, 2014. Parents aggregate
payment obligation under this _Section 11.5(b)_ shall be capped at
$100,000,000.

 



 

 **11.6** ** ****_Parties in Interest_**. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, as may be applicable, each of
_Article II_ , _Sections 3.2(h)_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ and _6.6_ , _Article X_ ,
this _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ are made for the benefit of (a) the
Stockholders, (b) the Representative and (c) any of the Companys and/or its
Subsidiaries (i) directors and officers, (ii) former directors and officers,
and (iii) employees. From and after the Closing, all of the Persons identified
in clauses (a) and (b) in the immediately preceding sentence shall be entitled
to enforce such provisions and to avail themselves of the benefits of any
remedy for any breach of such provisions, all to the same extent as if such
Persons were parties to this Agreement.

warranties, agreements or covenants other than those expressly set forth in
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by
independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and
its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and
the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed
against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that draft it is of no application and is
hereby expressly waived.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by
virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company or Parent,
as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each
of the Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall
not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The
Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those
contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an
item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is readily apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or
absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross
reference thereto.

 



 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same
be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether
any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in
any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of
this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the
beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this
Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be
disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words " _this
Agreement_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereby_ ," " _hereunder_ " and " _hereof_ " and
words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words " _this Section_
," " _this subsection_ " and words of similar import, refer only to the
Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "
_including_ " (in its various forms) means " _including, without limitation_."
The word "or" means " _and/_ or." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter
genders shall be construed to state and include any other gender and words,
terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall
be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context
otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and plural and the
conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context
otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Austin,
Texas time.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto
covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in
whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the
calculation of (including any component of) the Merger consideration or any
component thereof or calculation relating thereto, or any other calculated
amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion
(either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be
over- or under-counted for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) For purposes of the provisions of this Agreement, a document or other
instrument shall be deemed to have been "provided," "furnished," "delivered"
or "made available" to Parent and Merger Subsidiary only when such document or
other instrument has been uploaded onto the Data Room prior to October 9, 2012
in a manner fully readable by Parent and not removed prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **11.16** ** ****_Governing Law_**. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS.

 



 

 **11.17** ** ****_WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_**. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND
COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE,
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER,
RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT

 **11.18** ** ****_Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_**.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Federal
courts of the United States sitting in Harris County and any appellate court
from any such Federal court and, in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction
of such courts, to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Texas sitting in Harris County and any appellate court from any such state
court. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all
claims with respect to any such claim may be heard and determined in such
Federal court or, to the extent provided in the preceding sentence, Texas
state court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such claim
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any claim
relating to this Agreement or any related matter against any other party or
its assets or properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any Texas state or Federal court located in Travis County and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such court.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
THE REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

 **12.1** ** ****_Authorization of the Representatives_**.

 



 

(a) The Representatives have entered into this Agreement solely to acknowledge
their agreement to serve as representatives of the stockholders for the
limited purpose set forth herein. The Representatives will act as the agents
of the Stockholders in connection with, and to facilitate the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the other

 



      
 

 



 

Transaction Documents, and in connection with the activities to be performed
on behalf of the Stockholders under this Agreement, and will have the full
power and authority to receive consideration on behalf of the Stockholders,
and settle and resolve any disputes which may arise under _Article II_ with
respect to the Final Adjustment Amount and with regard to indemnification
claims made against the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the
communications of any of the Representatives relating to the foregoing
matters. Neither Parent nor the Company (i) shall be obligated to
independently confirm or verify the authority of any Representative to act on
behalf of all Stockholders as provided hereunder, or (ii) shall be held liable
or accountable in any manner for any act or omission of any Representative in
such capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) any communication given or
delivered by or on behalf of Parent to a Representative shall be deemed to
have been simultaneously given or delivered to all of the Representatives, and
(B) in the event that Parent receives conflicting or inconsistent
communications, directions or responses from the Representatives, Parent shall
be entitled to rely on such communications, directions or responses as Parent
in its sole discretion determines, and Parent shall not be responsible to the
Representatives or any Stockholder in making such determination.

 



 

 **12.2** ** ****_Exculpation_**. The Representatives are serving in a
ministerial role on behalf of the Stockholders and no claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
against any Representative personally. The Representatives, accordingly, shall
have no liability to any of the parties to this Agreement in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.
