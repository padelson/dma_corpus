Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Seller, as an individual obligor,
hereby sells to the Purchaser all Shares held by it pursuant to Schedule (A)

with all rights and obligations attaching to it as at the Closing Date with
the right to receive profits including profits which have not yet been

Payables is completed simultaneously.

2.3 Consents

The Sellers as sole shareholders of the Target Company hereby waive all
requirements regarding form and notice of calling and holding a shareholders'
meeting and hereby approve the contemplated assignment of

3Sale and Assignment of the Closing Intra-Group Payables

3.1 Status

Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp have made available to the Target Company financing
loans. Schedule 3.1 lists the respective payables owed by the Target Company
showing the relevant debtor and creditor, the outstanding principal amounts
and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, each as per 31 December 2014, the
applicable interest rates as well as the respective underlying agreement
between the debtor and the creditor. All claims of Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp
for payment of the amounts of the payables described above including accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, in either case outstanding as at Closing, are
herein referred to as "Closing Intra-Group Payables".

3.2 Sale

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp, as
an individual obligor, hereby sells to the Purchaser the Closing Intra-Group
Payables owed to it/him pursuant to Schedule 3.1 and the Purchaser hereby

and obligations in respect of and in connection with the respective Closing
Intra-Group Payables.

3.3 Assignment

| 
---|--- 

3.3.1

|

At Closing, each of Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp shall, subject to the condition
precedent (aufschiebende Bedingung) of the Purchase Prices plus default
interest pursuant to Clause 5.4.2, if any, being fully paid in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

assign or procure the assignment of the Closing Intra-Group Payables owed to
it/him pursuant to Schedule 3.1, and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

transfer or procure the transfer of all agreements and arrangements
(Vertragsubernahme) relating to the respective Closing Intra-Group Payables, 

 

to the Purchaser on the basis of a transfer agreement substantially in the
form as attached in Schedule 3.3.1. The Purchaser shall accept such
assignments and transfers. Neither the Purchaser nor Seller 1 or Mr Rovekamp
shall be obliged to complete the transfer of the Closing Intra-Group Payables
unless the sale and purchase of all of the Shares and all of the Closing Intra
Group Payables is completed simultaneously.

| 
---|---

|

Seller 1, Mr Rovekamp and the Purchaser agree that upon such assignments and
transfers Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp shall be discharged from, and the Purchaser
hereby indemnifies each of Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp from, all obligations in
respect of or in connection with the Closing Intra-Group Payables. 

| 
---|--- 

3.3.3

|

Seller 1 and Mr Rovekamp, each as an individual obligor, shall procure that
prior to or at Closing the relevant Group Companies give their respective
consents to the relevant assignments and transfers by the respective Seller as
necessary to give effect to the agreements in this Clause 3.3. 

3.4 Repayment of Loans and Equivalent Benefits

The Purchaser undertakes to procure that the Target Company does not become
insolvent within one year from Closing. If Seller 1 and/or Mr Rovekamp are
held liable for any liability or obligation arising from or in connection with
the total or partial repayment and/or interest payment within the first year
from Closing by the Target Company on any Closing Intra-Group Payables, in
either case granted by Seller 1 or Mr Rovekamp, the Purchaser shall indemnify
Seller 1 and/or Mr Rovekamp, as the case may be, and hold them harmless in
respect of any such liability or obligation, including any costs and expenses
unless and except to the extent that the payment made to Seller 1 or Mr
Rovekamp qualifies as a Leakage within the meaning of Clause 6.2.1 which is
not a Permitted Leakage within the meaning of Clause 6.2.2 and therefore
constitutes a breach of the obligations under Clause 6.1.

under the Hedging Agreements. At Closing, the Purchaser shall (re)pay the Bank

be the balance of

(i)the agreed enterprise value of the Group Companies of EUR 210,000,000,

(ii)

|

minus the consolidated third-party net financial debt of the Group Companies
as of the Accounts Date of EUR 18,634,895, 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

minus certain other financial deduction items of the Group Companies in the

(iv)minus the sum of the Closing Intra-Group Payables Purchase Prices at

as the "Share Purchase Prices".

5.2 Closing Intra-Group Payables Purchase Prices

The consideration for the sale of the Closing Intra-Group Payables under this
Agreement by Seller 1 and by Mr Rovekamp (together the "Closing Intra-Group
Payables Purchase Prices") shall in either case be equal to the amount of the
respective Closing Intra-Group Payables.

5.3 Cash Compensation Payment

For the period from (and including) the Accounts Date until (and excluding)
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay a cash compensation of EUR 2,250 for
each calendar day (the "Cash Compensation Amount").

| 
---|--- 

5.4.1

|

The Share Purchase Prices and the Closing Intra-Group Payables Purchase
Prices, together with the Cash Compensation Amount (collectively also referred
to as the "Purchase Prices") shall be due for payment at Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

5.4.2.

|

To the extent that the Purchase Prices are not paid when due, the outstanding
amounts shall bear interest at a rate of eight per cent (8 %) p.a. (calculated
on a 360 days-count basis) for the period from (and including) the due date
until and excluding the date of actual payment. 

5.5. Escrow

On the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall enter into an escrow
agreement with the German notary public Dr. Marcus Emmer having its seat c/o

as Schedule 5.5, ("Escrow Agreement"). The Sellers as a whole and the

of the costs for the escrow to be borne by the Sellers shall be allocated to
Seller 1 and Seller 2 on a pro rata basis according to their shareholding
percentage as set out in Schedule A.

5.6 Value Added Tax

To the extent that the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are subject
to VAT, the Purchaser shall pay such VAT in addition to the Purchase Prices.
VAT on each of the Purchase Prices is due for payment as soon as the Purchaser
has received from the relevant Seller an invoice which complies with the
provisions of Secs. 14, 14a of the German VAT Code (Umsatzsteuergesetz) or a
respective other applicable foreign tax provision. The Parties jointly assume
that the sale and assignment of the Shares and sale and assignment of the
Closing Intra-Group Payables are exempt from VAT. The Sellers hereby
irrevocably exclude their right to opt for VAT pursuant to Sec. 9 of the
German VAT Code or comparable provisions of non-German law.

5.7 Impact of Payments on the Purchase Price

If any payment or other performance is made by any of the Sellers or Mr
Rovekamp to the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to any of the Sellers or Mr
Rovekamp in respect of any claim under or in connection with this Agreement,
the payment or in case of a non-financial performance its financial value
shall be treated as a correction of the consideration paid by the Purchaser to
the relevant Seller or Mr Rovekamp under this Agreement and such consideration
shall be deemed to have been reduced or increased, as the case may be, by the
amount of such payment.

5.8 No Netting

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to

| 
---|--- 

5.8.1

|

set-off any rights and claims it may have against a Seller or Mr Rovekamp
against any rights or claims which the relevant Seller or Mr Rovekamp may have
under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, or 

| 
---|--- 

5.8.2

|

refuse to perform any obligation it may have under or in connection with this
Agreement on the grounds that it has a right of retention
(Zuruckbehaltungsrecht), 

unless the underlying rights or claims of the Purchaser have been acknowledged
in writing by the relevant Seller Mr Rovekamp or have been confirmed by final
decision of a competent court (Gericht) or arbitration panel (Schiedsgericht).

the amount of such excess, unnecessary allowance, provision or reserve,
receipt, understatement or overstatement shall be credited against and applied
in relieving the Sellers from any liability they would otherwise incur in
respect of any claim under or in connection with this Agreement to which the
excess, unnecessary allowance, provision or reserve, receipt, understatement

that this is known to the Purchaser, specify in reasonable detail for each
individual Breach the underlying facts constituting the Breach, the legal
basis for a potential claim and the amount or estimated amount of the damages
suffered by the Purchaser as result of the Breach. To the extent and as soon

Time Limit for pursuing Notified Claims

assistance, other than

the Purchaser believes to result, from a Breach (a "Third Party Claim") the
following shall apply:

No admissions in relation to such Third Party Claim shall be made by or on

discretion in the name and on behalf of the Purchaser or the relevant Group
Company. Notwithstanding the Purchaser's obligations pursuant to Clause

in particular promptly forward all notices, communications and filings

good faith and take any such action as the Sellers, or any one of them, may
reasonably request to defend, appeal, compromise or settle the Third Party
Claim (including the assertion and pursuit of counter-claims or other claims
against any third parties). The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the
relevant Group Company shall, (a) keep the relevant Seller or Sellers fully
informed of the progress of the Third Party Claim and its defence, (b)
promptly provide the relevant Seller or Sellers with copies of all material
notices, communications and filings (including court papers), (c) ensure that

Third Party Claim and its defence so as to give the relevant Seller or Sellers
the opportunity to comment and object. 
| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

In the defense against any Third Party Claim, whether governed by Subclause
(ii) or (iii) above, each Party shall, and Purchaser shall procure that the
relevant Group Company will, at all times and, in the case of Subclause (ii)
above, in particular until the Sellers, or any one of them, have notified the
Purchaser in accordance with Clause 12.7.5(ii), take into account the
reasonable interest of the respective other Party and the Group Companies in
relation to a Third Party Claim and shall consult with the relevant other
Party in relation to the suitable manner of dealing with the Third Party
Claim. In particular, the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant
Group Company will, notify the relevant Sellers promptly upon a Third Party
Claim being, or likely to be, asserted, made, threatened or filed, such Notice
to be submitted together with all information in relation to the Third Party
Claim which is available to the Purchaser and the relevant Group Company.

the Sellers, or any one of them, are, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, liable, be borne by the relevant Seller or Sellers, subject to
the Purchaser having complied with its obligations under this Clause 12.7. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

not comply in all material aspects with its obligations under this Clause
12.7.

integral part and define the scope of this promise of warranty, that except as
set forth in Schedule 13.1 the statements set forth in this Clause 13.1 (the
"Sellers' Tax Warranties") are true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement or as of such other date as is expressly stated in the respective
Seller's Tax Warranty.

|

The Group Companies have duly and timely paid, withheld and declared all Taxes
due pursuant to Tax filings or self-assessments made or Tax assessments

before or on the Closing Date to the respective competent Tax Authority. 

In case of a breach of the Tax Warranties under this Clause 13.1, the Sellers
shall compensate the Purchaser with respect to the following items of damage,
if and to the extent triggered by the breach of such Tax Warranties under this
Clause 13.1: (i) Verspatungszuschlage within the meaning of Sec. 152 AO and
comparable fines/penalties/surcharges of a non-German jurisdiction, (ii)

costs required to be incurred in connection with the preparation of the tax
declaration (Steueranmeldung), advance tax declaration (Steuervoranmeldungen)
or tax return (Steuererklarungen) or other declaration in connection with

Clause 13.1 cannot be recovered pursuant to Clause 13.2 (no double dip).

13.2 Tax Indemnity

| 
---|--- 

13.2.1

|

The Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the amount which is necessary to hold
each Group Company harmless of any and all due and payable Taxes which relate
to periods ending on or before the Accounts Date (each a "Tax Indemnification
Claim"), but only if and to the extent the specific Tax giving rise to such an
indemnification 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

does not relate to income that can be offset against Tax loss carry-backs or
Tax loss carry-forwards that are or were available until the Accounts Date;
for the avoidance of doubt, this Clause shall not apply with regard to any Tax
losses arising with respect to periods after the Accounts Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

does neither arise nor is increased as a result of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) failing or
omitting to duly make any claim or exercise any election right in each case in
accordance with past practice unless in each case required by mandatory law or
administrative guidelines as existing and in force as of the date of this
Agreement or exercised with the prior consent of the Sellers; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

together with all other Tax Indemnification Claims, i.e. the aggregate amount
of all Tax Indemnification Claims of Purchaser, exceeds the aggregate amount
of Tax liabilities (Steuerverbindlichkeiten) and Tax accruals
(Steuerruckstellungen) and other accruals (sonstige Ruckstellungen) for
potential Tax liabilities, if any, shown or provided for in the Annual
Accounts (for the avoidance of doubt, such amounts to be taken into
consideration shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax Refunds actually paid
to the Sellers pursuant to Clause 13.3.1(iii)); 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

is not the direct result of a reorganisation or of other measures initiated by
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Group Companies), or by their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents or other representatives, including but not limited to a change of
methods of Tax accounting or an amendment of any Tax returns of any Group
Company, unless in each case required by mandatory law or administrative
guidelines as 

existing and in force as of the date of this Agreement or exercised with the
prior consent of the Sellers;

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

does not directly lead to a Tax Benefit of any of the Group Companies after
the Accounts Date which is based on a circumstance having triggered the Tax
Indemnification Claim, including, but not limited to reciprocal effects
(Wechselwirkungen) resulting e.g. from the lengthening of depreciation periods
or higher depreciation allowances (Phasenverschiebung) or from transfer of
items relevant for Taxes (e.g. turnover, income, expenses, value added tax
payable corresponding with a value added tax refund etc.) into another
calendar year or transfer of Tax items from one entity to another entity; 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

does not result from any retroactive changes in law; and 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

was not actually reimbursed due to a claim for repayment, reimbursement or
indemnification against a party other than a Group Company (such claim to be
reduced by reasonable costs actually incurred by the Purchaser or the Group
Companies in connection with the enforcement of such claim) and, in case a
claim was not reimbursed, the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Group Companies
did use all reasonable best efforts to enforce such claim or have offered the
assignment of the respective claim to Seller so that Seller can directly
pursue such claim; the Purchaser shall inform the Sellers about potential
claims to be pursued and, in case of an enforcement of such claims by the
Purchaser or a Group Company, shall follow the instructions of the Sellers
subject to prior agreement of the budget for the enforcement of such claims to
be borne by the Sellers. 

The Sellers shall subject to the limitations pursuant to Clauses 13.2.1(iii)
to 13.2.1(vi) be obliged to pay to the Purchaser any amount by which the
amount of Tax receivables provided for in the Annual Accounts exceed the
amounts actually received in relation to such Tax receivables.

| 
---|--- 

13.2.2

|

The Sellers shall further pay to the Purchaser (a) 100% of an amount up to EUR
1,000,000 and (b) 80% of any further amount which is necessary to hold each
Group Company harmless of any and all due and payable Taxes which (i) result
from the items specified and described in Schedule 13.2.2 and (ii) which
relate to periods ending on or before the Accounts Date or with regard to the
potential withholding tax related to interest for shareholder loans until and
including the Closing Date ("Specific Tax Indemnification Claim"). Clauses
13.2.1(i) and 13.2.1(v) to 13.2.1(vii) shall apply accordingly to the specific
Tax giving rise to such indemnification. 

| 
---|--- 

13.2.3

|

The Sellers' indemnification obligations pursuant to this Clause 13.2 shall be
applied on a pro rata basis corresponding to the (direct or indirect)
participation quota of the respective Seller in the respective Group Company 

| 
---|--- 

13.2.4

|

Payments by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this Clause 13.2 shall be
due and payable within fifteen Business Days after receipt of the
corresponding claim notification by the Sellers (which must include copies of
the relevant administrative decision), however, not earlier than five Business
Days prior to the due date of the relevant Tax. 

| 
---|--- 

13.2.5

|

If the Tax for which an indemnification payment has been made is subsequently
reduced, the Purchaser shall be obliged to reimburse the Sellers for the
difference between the higher indemnification payment and the lower Tax
amount, including all interests related thereto as assessed by the Tax
Authorities 

to the extent not already reimbursed to the Sellers pursuant to Clause 13.3.1.
The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies will, notify

13.4 Indemnity Procedure

| 
---|--- 

13.4.1

|

The Purchaser shall and shall procure that after the Closing Date any of the
Group Companies prepare and file all Tax returns concerning periods until and
including the Accounts Date ("Relevant Tax Return" or "Relevant Tax Returns")
in line with past practice and in accordance with applicable law. Any Relevant
Tax Return shall be subject to the review and prior written consent of the
Sellers which must not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. The Purchaser
shall and shall procure that the Group Companies will (i) provide the Sellers
with any draft Relevant Tax Return no later than 30 Business Days prior to the

accordance with the written instructions of the Sellers. This shall apply
accordingly with regard to any amendments of Relevant Tax Returns. 
| 
---|--- 

13.4.2

|

The Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers will be informed in writing by
the respective Group Company of any notices in respect of a Tax audit and
similar audits of Tax Authorities as well as on the issue of a Tax assessment
and any other written communication between a Group Company and a Tax
Authority for periods which relate to Taxes that might constitute the basis
for a claim pursuant to Clauses 13.1, 13.2 or 13.3. Such Tax audits and
similar audits of Tax Authorities are hereinafter referred to as "Tax Audits";
such tax assessments are hereinafter referred to as "Tax Measures". The
notification shall be made in writing and without undue delay after the
Purchaser or the relevant Group Company has received written notifications or
other documents from a Tax Authority of such event and shall contain full
factual information describing the object of the Tax Audit or Tax Measure in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any assessment, notice or other
relevant document received from any Tax Authority related to the respective
Tax. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4.3

|

The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant Group Company shall,
(i) give the Sellers the opportunity to participate at their own costs and
expenses from the beginning in all Tax Audits and Tax Measures, (ii) upon
Sellers\' written request and at their costs and expenses, challenge and
litigate any Tax assessment or other decision of any Tax Authority or Tax
court and (iii) comply with any written instructions given by Sellers in
relation to the conduct of the Tax proceedings referred to in (i) or (ii)
above to the extent such instructions comply with applicable laws. In any case
the Purchaser shall procure that after the Closing Date no Tax which might
constitute the basis for a claim pursuant to Clause 13 is settled or accepted
without the prior written consent of the Sellers. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4.4

|

Upon the Sellers' written request and at their costs and expenses, the
Purchaser shall procure that the respective Group Company will, in accordance
with the Sellers' written instructions which have to comply with applicable
laws, file, withdraw or amend legal remedies in respect of Tax assessments for
periods ending on or before the Accounts Date which have been amended due to
Tax Audits or in respect of Tax Measures. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4.5

|

The aforementioned provisions pursuant to Clauses 13.4.1 to 13.4.4 shall not
apply with regard to the items specified and described in Schedule 13.2.2 and
to Tax returns, Tax proceedings, Tax Audits and Tax Measures, in each case if
and to the extent they relate to such specific items which shall insofar be
under the sole control of the Purchaser. However, the Purchaser shall also
duly inform the Sellers about any of such Tax returns, Tax proceedings, Tax
Audit or Tax Measures relating to such specific items. In addition, the
Purchaser shall upon reasonable written request of the Sellers provide Sellers
with any material information on the envisaged Tax treatment of such specific
items and shall consult with the Sellers in good faith about the potential Tax
treatment of such specific items in Tax filings and about potential written
objections and challenges of Tax assessments aiming at a mitigation of the Tax
to be incurred, it being understood that the final decision remains with the
Purchaser. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4.6

|

The Sellers shall not be liable under or in connection with the Tax indemnity
pursuant to this Clause 13 if and to the extent the Purchaser does not comply
with its obligations under this Clause 13.4 provided that such violation has
actually caused the respective claim under this Clause 13. In case the
Purchaser fails (i) to observe a time limit set by law after a initial period
of three (3) months after Closing Date or set by the Tax Authorities in
accordance with the law, (ii) to change Tax returns, (iii) to challenge Tax
assessments upon written request of Sellers or (iv) to timely inform the
Sellers about material meetings with Tax Authorities, in each case to the
extent required by the provisions of this 

Clause 13.4, it is rebuttably assumed (widerlegbar vermutet) that such
violation has caused the respective claim under this Clause 13.

13.5 Exclusivity

shall be limited to an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 3,000,000.

the Group Companies prior to Closing. The Purchaser shall afford such access
upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.

17.7 Disputes

| 
---|--- 

17.7.1

|

Any contractual and non-contractual dispute arising from or in connection with
this Agreement and its consummation, including disputes about its validity,
shall be finally settled by three arbitrators in accordance with the
arbitration rules of the German Institution of Arbitration (Deutsche
Institution fur Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit e.V.) without recourse to the courts of
law. The venue of the arbitration shall be Munich, Germany. The language of
the arbitral proceedings shall be English, provided however, that the Parties
shall be entitled to submit written evidence in the German language. 

| 
---|--- 

17.7.2

|

In the event mandatory applicable law requires any matter arising from or in
connection with this Agreement and its consummation, including disputes about
its validity, to be decided upon by a court of law, the competent courts in
and for the City of Munich, Germany, shall have the exclusive jurisdiction
thereupon. 

17.8 Form of Amendments 

Any amendment or supplement to, or the termination of, this Agreement,
including this provision, shall be valid only if made in writing
(Schriftform), except where a stricter form (e.g. notarisation) is required
under applicable law or this Agreement.

17.9 Assignments

The Purchaser shall not, in whole or in part, dispose (verfugen) of any claims
(including future or contingent claims)arising from or in connection with this
Agreement by way of assignment, encumbrance or otherwise without the prior
written Notice from the Sellers consenting to such disposal, such Notice not
to be unreasonably withheld. This shall in particular, without limitation,
apply to any disposal by way of a split-off in the meaning of § 123
Reorganisation Act (UmwG) unless the Purchaser's claims arising from and in
connection with this Agreement are by way of such split-off transferred
together with all or substantially all other assets of the Purchaser to one
and the same receiving entity. The transfer restrictions pursuant to this
Clause 17.8 shall not apply in the event of (i) an assignment to a Purchaser
Affiliate, provided that it is ensured with in rem effect (mit dinglicher
Wirkung) by written agreement between the Purchaser and the relevant Purchaser
Affiliate that in case of a termination of the affiliation (which shall be
notified to the Sellers without undue delay) the claims will automatically re-
transfer to the Purchaser without any encumbrance, or (ii) an assignment to a
financing bank for the purpose of securing the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) an assignment to the insurer of the
WandI insurance policy taken out in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any disposal of
claims with or without the Sellers consent shall not affect any of the
limitations of the liability under this Agreement in particular under Clause
12.

17.10 Invalid Provisions

Should any provision of this Agreement be or held to be wholly or partly
invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, this shall not affect the validity,
effectiveness or enforceability of the remaining provisions. Any such invalid,
ineffective or unenforceable provision shall, to the extent permitted by law,
be deemed replaced by such valid, effective and enforceable provision as comes
closest to the economic intent and purpose of such invalid, ineffective or
unenforceable provision. The aforesaid shall apply mutatis mutandis to any
unintended omission in this Agreement.

17.11 Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among and between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall replace any negotiations
and understandings, oral or written, heretofore made between the Parties or
any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof. Side agreements to this
Agreement do not exist.

---|--- 

17.13
