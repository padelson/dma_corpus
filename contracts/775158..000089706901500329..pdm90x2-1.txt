3.8      Notification of Completion Net Debt and Completion Transaction Costs

         Within twenty (20) Business Days after the Completion Date, the
         Purchasers shall notify the Sellers of the amount of the Completion Net
         Debt and the Completion Transaction Costs, together with details of all
         components thereof (including but without limitation the Completion
         Inter-Company Loans and the Completion Inter-Company Debt). At such
         time, the calculation set out in Clause 3.2 shall be repeated replacing
         Estimated Net Debt with Completion Net Debt and Estimated Transaction
         Costs with Completion Transaction Costs. By reference to the final
         confirmation of Completion Net Debt and Completion Transaction Costs,
         the Sellers shall repay any amount overpaid by the Purchasers, or, as
         the case may be, the Purchasers shall make an additional payment of any
         underpayment by them on Completion, together with:

         (a)      the relevant interest overcharged, or, as the case may be
                  undercharged on said sum from 31 March 2001 to Completion or
                  31 July 2001 (as the case may be) pursuant to Clause 3.2; and

         (b)      an amount representing interest at the rate applied in Clause
                  3.2 (from Completion to the date of further payment or
                  repayment as the case may be) on the amount payable or
                  repayable under this Clause. For the avoidance of doubt, this
                  Clause 3.8(b) shall not apply in respect of any sums referred
                  to in Clause 3.8(a).

         Payment is to be made in either case within five (5) Business Days of
         the date of issue of the final confirmation of Completion Net Debt and
         Completion Transaction Costs. Any payments made in accordance with this
         Clause 3.8 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

3.9      If Sellers disagree with Notification

         The Sellers shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
         notification being submitted to them in accordance with Clause 3.8
         (Notification of Completion Net Debt and Completion Transaction Costs),
         notify the Purchasers in writing either that they approve of it or that
         they disagree with it, in which event they shall in such notification
         give details of the matters with which they disagree and the reasons
         for such disagreement. If the Sellers fail to issue such notice within
         fifteen (15) Business Days they shall be deemed to have approved the
         notification submitted by the Purchasers. In the event of disagreement
         the Sellers and the Purchasers shall use all reasonable endeavours
         forthwith to resolve the matter or matters in dispute. Any such

                                       17
<PAGE>
         resolution which enables the Completion Net Debt, the Completion
         Transaction Costs, the Completion Inter-Company Loans and the
         Completion Inter-Company Debt to be agreed shall be expressed in a
         joint confirmation (the "Joint Resolution"), signed by the Purchasers
         and the Sellers, stating the Completion Net Debt, the Completion
         Transaction Costs, the Completion Inter-Company Loans and the
         Completion Inter-Company Debt. If no Joint Resolution shall be issued
         within thirty (30) Business Days of the notification having been
         submitted to the Sellers as aforesaid, the matter shall be referred to
         a firm of independent chartered accountants jointly agreed upon between
         the Purchasers and the Sellers or (failing such agreement) appointed,
         at the request of either the Purchasers or the Sellers at any time, by
         the President from time to time of the Institute of Chartered
         Accountants in England and Wales, which firm (the "Independent
         Accountants") shall then determine the matter in dispute and, shall
         confirm the Completion Net Debt, the Completion Transaction Costs, the
         Completion Inter-Company Loans and the Completion Inter-Company Debt.
         The Independent Accountants shall act as experts and not as
         arbitrators. Their decision shall be communicated in writing to the
         Purchasers and the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon the
         Purchaser and the Sellers, save in the event of manifest error.

3.10     Costs to be Borne jointly

         The costs of the Independent Accountants shall be borne as to one half
         by the Sellers and as the other half by the Purchasers in connection
         with all matters specified in Clause 3.8 to 3.12 (inclusive).

3.11     Records etc. to be Made Available

         The Purchasers shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that all
         records, working papers and other information within its possession or
         control as may be reasonably required by the Sellers and/or the
         Independent Accountants for the purpose of Clauses 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10,
         shall be made available as soon as practicable upon a request for them
         and shall generally render all reasonable assistance reasonably
         necessary in connection with the final confirmation of the Completion
         Net Debt and the Completion Transaction Costs.

                  conditions which are reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and
                  the Purchasers.

         For the purposes of this Clause 4.1(b), the Sellers shall not be
         entitled to object to the acceptance of a condition of such positive

         to a material extent the interests of a member of the Sellers' Group
         and the Purchasers shall not be entitled to object to a condition of
         such positive advice unless such condition directly or indirectly

         others written evidence (if available) of the fulfilment of that

         non-fulfilment.

4.3      Consultation with Works Council

(1)      The Sellers and the Purchasers undertake to use all reasonable
         endeavours to obtain the positive advice of the Works Council to the

         Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.

(2)      If the positive advice of the Works Council is obtained subject to
         conditions the Sellers and the Purchasers shall consult with each other
         to seek to determine if and to what extent the conditions are
         reasonably acceptable to them, whether further consultation with the
         Works Council is necessary or desirable, and how they might address
         such conditions (or any of them).

         Jurisdiction)) shall terminate and no party shall have any claim
         against any other, but without prejudice to the accrued rights and
         obligations of the parties in respect of any breaches of this Agreement
         before that termination.

4.5      Period before Completion

(1)      The Sellers undertake that they shall procure that between the date of

                  adverse effect on the financial or trading position of the
                  Group as a whole; and

         (b)      the Agreed Redundancy Programme shall be completed in
                  accordance with its terms.

         respect of the Group and relating to the period between the date of
         this Agreement and the Completion Date which gives rise to a payment to
         the Sellers under such policies, the Sellers shall, as soon as
         reasonably practicable following the later of Completion and receipt by
         the Sellers of any settlement monies, pay an amount equal to such

         Conditions not fulfilled), on or before the date so advised by the
         Sellers or the Purchasers (as appropriate)) the Purchasers shall,
         subject to demonstrating to the reasonable satisfaction of the Sellers
         that the Purchasers have used their best endeavours to obtain such
         funding, be entitled to elect by notice to the Sellers' Guarantor to
         terminate this Agreement (a "Termination Notice") (provided that in no
         circumstances shall the Purchasers be entitled to issue a Termination
         Notice other than on the later of 31 July 2001 and such date as the
         Sellers or the Purchasers (as appropriate) may have advised in

         avoidance of doubt, unless the Sellers agree otherwise, the Purchasers
         shall be obliged to use their best endeavours aforesaid from the date
         hereof until the earlier of the date upon which the necessary funding
         to satisfy the Purchase Price has been obtained or a Termination Notice
         is issued, unless prior to such date, this Agreement has been
         terminated in accordance with Clause 4.4 (If conditions not fulfilled).

         (b)      as regards repayment, no less favourable than the repayment
                  schedule set out in the Purchasers' Funding Termsheet.

         For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchasers' use of best endeavours
         shall not require them to make formal approaches to any bank other than
         Bank of America Securities LLC unless and until it reasonably believes
         that it will not obtain funding from it substantially in accordance
         with the Purchasers' Funding Termsheet.

         Purchasers shall be deemed to have approved the draft in the form
         submitted to them.

(6)      Subject to Clause 4.14(7), on or before 20 July 2001 the Sellers'
         Guarantor shall provide to the Purchasers a further updated version of

         appropriate) of a later date in accordance with Clause 4.4 (If
         Conditions not fulfilled), the seventh day prior to such later date) to
         give written notice to the Sellers' Guarantor requesting that an
         updated version of the Purchasers' Banking Schedule be provided within
         seven days of such notice, completed with the information required to
         be included therein drawn up as at the date prior to the date of

(8)      In the event that the Sellers' Guarantor does not deliver the revised
         Purchasers' Banking Schedule by the time specified in Clause 4.14(3) or
         the further updated Purchasers' Banking Schedule by the time specified
         in Clauses 4.14(6) or 4.14 (7) (as the case may be) and as a direct
         consequence thereof:

         (a)      the Purchasers are delayed in their ability to obtain funding
                  in respect of the Purchase Price substantially on the terms of
                  the Purchasers' Funding Termsheet (as defined in Clause 4.11)
                  (having used their best endeavours so to do in accordance with
                  Clause 4.11), then the interest otherwise payable by the
                  Purchasers pursuant to Clauses 3.2 (Payment on Account) and
                  3.8 (Notification of Completion Net Debt and Completion
                  Transaction Costs) shall not be payable in respect of each day
                  by which the Sellers' Guarantor is late in providing the
                  revised Purchasers' Banking Schedule or the further updated
                  Purchasers' Banking Schedule (as appropriate); or

         (b)      the Purchasers are unable to obtain funding in respect of the
                  Purchase Price substantially on the terms of the Purchasers'
                  Funding Termsheet (as defined in Clause 4.11) (having used
                  their best endeavours so to do in accordance with Clause
                  4.11), where the revised and/or updated Purchasers' Banking
                  Schedule

                                       26
<PAGE>
                  is not provided by the Sellers' Guarantor within sixteen days
                  after the time specified in Clauses 4.14(3) or 4.14(6) or
                  4.14(7) (as appropriate) respectively and the Purchasers issue
                  a Termination Notice, the sum specified in Clause 4.13
                  (Payment to Sellers' Guarantor) shall not be payable.

(9)      If at any time prior to Completion, the Sellers' Guarantor becomes
         aware of any matter, fact or circumstance (save in respect of the
         indebtedness of the Group) which, were it to be reflected in a further
         updated Purchasers' Banking Schedule as at the date the Sellers'
         Guarantor becomes aware of such matter, fact or circumstance, would
         give rise to material variance from the information contained in the
         updated Purchasers Banking Schedule prepared in accordance with Clauses
         4.14(3) or 4.14(6) or 4.14(7) (as the case may be) (which shall mean a
         variance equal to or greater than one million Euros), then the Sellers'
         Guarantor shall notify the Purchasers of such matter, fact or
         circumstance as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of
         the same.

(10)     The Sellers' Guarantor shall prepare the Purchasers' Banking Schedule
         and any other information which it is obliged to provide pursuant to
         this Clause 4.14 in good faith. Subject thereto, neither the Sellers
         nor the Sellers' Guarantor shall be liable in equity, contract or tort
         or under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 or in any other way in respect
         of the contents of the Purchasers' Banking Schedule being false,
         inaccurate or incomplete (save in the case of fraud).

         Sellers are required to do so by applicable laws. The Purchasers shall

         reasonable endeavours to obtain all anti-trust or competition
         confirmations or consents required under any applicable legislation,

         connection with or in consequence of or in respect of the circumstances
         giving rise to the breach of that Warranty.

         on demand, pay to the Purchasers an amount equal to the aggregate of:

         by the Sellers and the Purchasers or adjudged by a court of competent
         jurisdiction to be payable in each case in satisfaction or settlement
         of such claim, at the election of the Sellers the Purchasers shall
         deliver a legal assignment of the debt or debts giving rise to such

                  Disclosed Environmental Matters shall not in any way
                  whatsoever limit the ability of the Purchasers to claim under
                  the Warranties in respect of the Disclosed Environmental
                  Matters or limit or otherwise affect the amount of damages
                  that the Purchasers may recover in respect of any such claims;

         (c)      the Purchasers, in agreeing to the Purchase Price, did not
                  take into account any Losses that may arise as a consequence

                  amount set out in paragraph 3(c) of Schedule 5

                  thereof shall be limited in accordance with paragraph 3(c) of

13.      TAX LOSSES AND FISCAL UNITY

13.1     Norba Limited losses

(1)      The Purchasers undertake to the Sellers that they shall take all
         reasonable steps permitted by law to procure that Norba Limited shall
         surrender to the Sellers' Guarantor or as the Sellers' Guarantor may
         direct (but other than to Geesink Norba Limited) by way of group relief
         an amount no greater than the value of all sums or losses capable of
         being so surrendered by Norba Limited to the extent permitted by law
         and required by the Sellers in respect of the accounting period ending
         on the Balance Sheet Date (the "Norba Tax Losses"). The Sellers'
         Guarantor agrees it shall pay or procure the payment to Norba Limited
         of a sum equal to 30% of the amount of the Norba Tax Losses less an
         amount equal to the aggregate of sums already paid to Norba Limited on
         account of the Norba Tax Losses. Payment under this Clause 13.1 shall
         be made on the date or, if the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments)
         Regulations 1998 apply, the dates, on which the tax liability of the
         relevant company is, or but for the surrender would have been, due and
         payable.

(2)      No surrender shall take place under this Clause 13.1 if the surrender
         would give rise to a liability to Taxation of Norba Limited for which
         the Purchaser could make a claim under the Tax Deed.

13.2     Geesink Norba Limited profits

(1)      The Purchasers undertake to the Sellers' Guarantor that they shall take
         all reasonable steps permitted by law to procure that Geesink Norba
         Limited shall accept a surrender by way of group relief of losses to
         the extent permitted by law (but other than from Norba Limited) of an
         amount no greater than such of its profits chargeable to corporation
         tax for the period ending on the Balance Sheet Date which are capable

                                       44
<PAGE>
         of being relieved by such losses (the "Geesink Norba Profits") and
         shall procure that Geesink Norba Limited shall pay to the Sellers'
         Guarantor, or as the Sellers' Guarantor may direct, when the
         corporation tax on the Geesink Norba Profits would otherwise have
         payable an amount equal to 30% of the sum so surrendered less an amount
         equal to the aggregate of sums already paid by Geesink Norba Limited to
         the Seller (or as directed by the Sellers' Guarantor) on account of the
         liability to corporation tax in respect of the Geesink Norba Profits.
         Payment under this Clause 13.2 shall be made on the date or, if the
         Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments) Regulations 1998 apply, the dates
         on which the tax liability of Geesink Norba Limited is or but for the
         surrender would have been due and payable.

(2)      The Purchasers shall and shall procure that each of Geesink Norba
         Limited and Norba Limited (at the cost of the Sellers' Guarantor) signs
         and submits to the relevant Taxing Authority all such notices of
         consent to surrender and all such other documents and returns as may be
         necessary to ensure that full effect is given to the provisions of this
         Clause 13.2.

13.3     Disputes

         If any dispute arises under this Clause 13.1 or 13.2 as to the amount
         of any surrender that may be permitted by law, such dispute shall be
         referred for determination to a firm of independent chartered
         accountants agreed between the Sellers' Guarantor and the Purchasers
         and failing such agreement a firm of independent chartered accountants
         shall be nominated by the President for the time being of the Institute
         of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (the "Expert") who in
         making such determination shall act as expert and not arbitrator and
         whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties thereto
         subject to any challenge by a Taxing Authority. The Expert may make
         such enquiries as he shall think fit in order to make such
         determination and shall also determine how the costs of obtaining his
         opinion should be paid and borne by the parties.

13.4     Denial of Surrenders

         To the extent that the surrenders of group relief pursuant to Clause
         13.1 or 13.2 are subsequently denied or varied by a Tax Authority,
         adjustments shall be made to the payments made for the surrender of the
         group relief as appropriate and the sum by which any payment exceeds
         the amount of Tax relieved shall be repaid as appropriate.

         Group BV and the Fiscal Unity Subsidiaries for periods ending on or
         before the Balance Sheet Date (and in the same proportions as payment
         is made to Powell Duffryn Holdings BV under this clause).

(5)      The parties acknowledge that (i) no payment is required to be made
         under Clause 13.1 if and to the extent that a payment is required to be
         made by the Sellers under the Tax Deed and any payment due under Clause
         13.1 shall be set against any payment then due from the Sellers under
         the Tax Deed and (ii) in each such case where payment is not required
         to be made under Clause 13.1, Powell Duffryn Holdings BV will discharge
         the relevant payments of tax on behalf of Geesink Group BV and the
         Fiscal Unity Subsidiaries, as appropriate, within applicable time
         limits.

(6)      Powell Duffryn Holdings BV will immediately on receipt from the Dutch
         Taxing Authorities pay to Oshkosh Group BV (as agent for Geesink Group
         BV and the Fiscal Unity Subsidiaries) all repayments of Tax received by

         Holdings BV agrees to use its reasonable endeavours to obtain such
         repayment of all such instalments from the Dutch Taxing Authorities as

                  subject to the condition that the relevant Seller or Purchaser

         are applicable to the conduct of all or any part of the operations of
         the Company, and the Sellers have not received any material written

<PAGE>

19.2     So far as the Sellers are aware, there are no current circumstances
         that cause the Sellers to be in breach of any of the Environmental Laws
         or would cause them to be in breach were they to remain the owner of
         the Company.

19.3     So far as the Sellers are aware, there are no current circumstances
         affecting the Company that justify the imposition of any requirement by
         a competent authority in accordance with such authority's powers and
         obligations under the Environmental Laws which would if the requirement
         were not complied with result in there being a breach of Environmental
         Laws.

19.4     There are no past nor have the Sellers received any written notice of
         any pending or threatened, proceedings or claims against the Sellers

         subsistence of the Environmental Permits) by the Sellers. So far as the
         Sellers are aware, all conditions, restrictions and obligations
         contained in the Environmental Permits have been complied with and, so

         Environmental Permits should be or may be revoked or amended.

19.6     No part of the Properties has been designated contaminated land within
         the meaning of section 57 of the Environment Act 1995 (or analogous

         (a)      would any part of the Properties be so designated; nor

         (b)      is any part of the Properties otherwise contaminated to any
                  material degree (whether by the deposit, spillage or disposal
                  or leaching of any hazardous or toxic material, or other
                  pollutant or otherwise) and, so far as the Sellers are aware,
                  as a result of any such contamination no part of the
                  Properties represents a hazard to health or to the Environment
                  assuming neither the Properties (nor any part of them) are
                  developed or otherwise put to use in ways differing from the
                  current operations carried out on the Properties.

<PAGE>

19.7     So far as the Sellers are aware:

         (a)      there are no circumstances which will give rise or have in the
                  past given rise to any liability (whether under statute or at
                  common law) in nuisance in respect of the Properties or the
                  operation of the business of the Company; and

         (b)      the carrying on of the business of the Company has not
                  interfered in any way with the extraction and use of ground
                  water from aquifers.

19.8     So far as the Sellers are aware, no third party (including (without
         limitation) any previous owners of any part of the Properties) has
         committed any act which has resulted in any liability under
         Environmental Laws or under common law being incurred by that third
         party in respect of nuisance caused in relation to the Properties or
         the business of the Company.

19.9     The condition of the soil and groundwater at any of the Properties does
         not at the present time adversely affect the ability of the Company to
         carry on its business.

20.      HEALTH & SAFETY

         respects with all applicable laws, regulations and legally binding and

         legally enforceable powers relating to the prevention of accidents and
         of injury to employees and to lawful and unlawful visitors to the
         Properties that are in existence at the date of this Agreement and are
         legally enforceable ("the Health and Safety Laws") both in respect of
         the activities undertaken at the date of this Agreement at the
         Properties and in respect of the Properties themselves at the date of
         this Agreement. For the purposes of this Paragraph 20.1 the Company
         shall be deemed not to have complied in a material respect with a
         particular Health and Safety Law if the amount that would otherwise be
         recoverable arising from that instance of non-compliance is
         (E)100,000 or more.

20.2     So far as the Sellers are aware, there are no outstanding prohibitions
         and/or improvement notices under the Health and Safety Laws affecting
         the Company, nor have there been in the past, and so far as the Sellers
         are aware there are currently no pending, proceedings against the
         Company under the Health and Safety Laws which have had or which would,

                                       122

                                       139
<PAGE>

         (a)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties, save in relation
                  to any of the Warranties set out in Paragraphs 2 (Shares and
                  Share Capital), 17 (Taxation Matters), 19 (Environment) and 21
                  (Competition) and 12.11 (Norba Agreement) only of Part 1 of
                  Schedule 4 (Warranties), unless the amount (excluding interest
                  and costs) that would be recoverable from the Sellers in
                  respect of the claim exceeds (E)100,000 (one hundred thousand
                  euros). For this purpose, if a claim relates to more than one
                  event or circumstance which would separately constitute a
                  breach of any of the Warranties or any other provision of this
                  Agreement that claim shall be treated as a separate claim in
                  respect of each event or circumstance;

         (b)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties, save in relation
                  to any of the Warranties set out in Paragraphs 2 (Shares and
                  Share Capital), 17 (Taxation Matters), 19 (Environment) and 21
                  (Competition) and 12.11 (Norba Agreement) only of Part 1 of
                  Schedule 4 (Warranties), until the amount (excluding interest
                  and costs) that would be recoverable from the Sellers in
                  respect of the claim, when aggregated with the amount
                  (excluding interest and costs) recoverable in respect of any
                  other claims against the Sellers under the Warranties or any
                  other provision of this Agreement (and for those purposes
                  ignoring any claims which the Purchasers are not entitled to
                  bring because of paragraph 3(a) (Specific Limitations) above)
                  exceeds a threshold of (E)5,000,000 (five million euros) in
                  which event, the Sellers' liability shall be for the whole of
                  such amount and not just the amount by which that threshold is
                  exceeded;

         (c)      with respect to a claim under the Environmental Warranties
                  relating to all Disclosed Environmental Matters unless and
                  until the aggregated amount (excluding interest and costs)
                  that would be recoverable from the Sellers in respect of any
                  claim or claims exceeds a threshold of (E)2,200,000 (two
                  million two hundred thousand euros) in which event the
                  Sellers' liability shall be limited to the amount by which the
                  threshold is exceeded. (For this purpose it shall be assumed
                  that the Disclosed Environmental Matters have not been
                  disclosed to the Purchaser and that the Purchaser had not
                  taken into account any Losses they may incur as a consequence
                  thereof in agreeing the Purchase Price ;

         (d)      with respect to a claim under the Environmental Warranties
                  relating to any Undisclosed Environmental Matter unless the

                  recoverable from the Sellers in respect of the claim

<PAGE>
                  exceeds (E)10,000 (ten thousand euros). For this purpose if
                  a claim relates to more than one event or circumstance which
                  would separately constitute a breach of any of the
                  Environmental Warranties or any other provision of this
                  Agreement that claim shall be treated as a separate claim in
                  respect of each event or circumstance;

         (e)      with respect to any claim under the Environmental Warranties
                  relating to Undisclosed Environmental Matters unless and until
                  the amount (excluding interest and costs) that would be
                  recoverable from the Sellers in respect of the claim, when
                  aggregated with the amount (excluding interest and costs)
                  recoverable in respect of any other such claims against the
                  Sellers (and for this purpose ignoring any claims which the
                  Purchasers are not entitled to bring because of paragraph 3(d)
                  (Specific Limitations) above) exceeds a threshold
                  of (E)100,000 (one hundred thousand euros) in which event the
                  Sellers' liability shall be for the whole of such amount and
                  not just the amount by which that threshold is exceeded;

         (f)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties, in respect of
                  any matters disclosed or referred to in this Agreement (or
                  arising from implementation of the same) or fairly disclosed
                  in the Disclosure Letter or otherwise actually known to Robert
                  Bohn, Timothy Dempsey, Charles Szews, David Sagehorn or Tom
                  Olson before the date of this Agreement. The contents of the
                  Norba Acquisition Agreement, the schedules to the Norba
                  Acquisition Agreement for the purposes of this Agreement, be
                  deemed to be fairly disclosed in the Disclosure Letter;

         (g)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties or any other
                  provision of this Agreement, in respect of any matter or thing
                  after the date of this Agreement done or omitted to be done at
                  the written request of or with the written consent of the
                  Purchasers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them or
                  any other member of the Purchasers' Group and the Purchasers
                  knew that the effect of such action or omission would be to
                  give rise to a breach of the Warranties or any other provision
                  of this Agreement;

         (h)      if and to the extent that:

                  (i)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties, the
                           claim would not have arisen but for any act,
                           omission, transaction or arrangement (or any
                           combination of any of the same) after Completion of
                           the Purchasers, the Companies the Subsidiaries or any
                           of them or any member of the

                           arrangements in the ordinary course of business, or
                           pursuant to any legal or regulatory requirement;

                  (ii)     with respect to a claim under the Warranties, the
                           claim would not have arisen but for any change in the
                           accounting policy or practice of the Companies, the
                           Subsidiaries or any of them having effect after
                           Completion except where such change is reasonably
                           necessary to enable the Company, the Subsidiaries or
                           any of them to comply with generally accepted
                           accounting principles at the date of Completion in

                           claim arises or is increased as a result of the
                           passing of, or any change in or any change in the
                           interpretation of, any law, rule, regulation or

                           as an asset in the Consolidated Accounts or which has
                           been taken into account in computing Taxation or
                           deferred Taxation in the Consolidated Accounts) in
                           the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them which
                           are available (whether by surrender or otherwise) at
                           the date of claim to be set off against the loss
                           giving rise to the claim;

                  (viii)   with respect to a claim under the Warranties (other
                           than in relation to any of the Warranties set out in
                           Paragraph 17 of Part 1 of the Warranties relating to
                           Taxation) or any other provision of this Agreement,
                           any amount by which any Taxation for which the
                           Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them is liable
                           is actually reduced or extinguished as a consequence
                           of a payment in respect of the matter giving rise to
                           a claim under the Warranties. For this purpose the
                           Taxation shall be treated as having been actually
                           reduced or extinguished when either:

                           (aa)     payment of Taxation is made by the
                                    Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them
                                    of a lesser amount than would otherwise have
                                    been the case; or

                           (bb)     no payment is made which would otherwise
                                    have been payable,

                           in either case as a result of the Companies, the
                           Subsidiaries or any of them obtaining a deduction in
                           respect of that payment in computing its profits or
                           gains for Tax purposes or in computing the amount of
                           any loss incurred in a trade or the amount of any
                           capital loss where such loss is set against other
                           taxable profits or gains of the Companies, the
                           Subsidiaries or any of them in respect of which Tax
                           would otherwise have been payable.

                           As and when the actual reduction or extinction occurs
                           this paragraph 3(h)(viii) (Specific Limitations)
                           shall operate first so as to require the Purchasers
                           to account to the Sellers for any payment previously
                           so made by it to the extent that the payment would
                           not have been made had that actual reduction or
                           extinction then occurred and after that to

                           Agreement;

                                    to the extent that a Reasonable and Prudent
                                    Operator would exacerbate, increase or
                                    aggravate any such environmental condition

                                    the extent that a Reasonable and Prudent
                                    Operator would take any such steps which
                                    shall include, without limitation, intrusive
                                    investigations in relation to the sale or

                           Warranties, to the extent any claim relates to Losses

                  (xii)    with respect to any claim under the Environmental
                           Warranties, to the extent such claim relates to any
                           change of use at or development of any Property
                           (excluding any reasonable development in the ordinary
                           course of the business of the Companies at the
                           Property carried on as at Completion) or the carrying
                           out of any change of process except where connected
                           with such reasonable development as aforesaid, in
                           each case after Completion; and

         (i)      with respect to a claim under the Warranties set out in
                  Paragraph 17 (Taxation) of Part 1 of the Warranties, to the
                  extent that the provisions of Clause 4 of the Tax Deed apply.

4.       MAXIMUM LIABILITY

         The aggregate liability of the Sellers in respect of claims under the
         Warranties or any other provision of this Agreement and the Tax Deed
         (save where expressly provided otherwise in the Tax Deed) shall not
         exceed the Purchase Price (including all legal, accountancy,
         professional and any other costs, fees and expenses incurred by the
         Purchasers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries or any of them in
         seeking to enforce their respective rights in respect of the matters
         giving rise to those claims) provided that this cap shall not apply in
         respect of claims brought under Clause 2 (Agreement to Sell and
         Purchase).

5.       NO DOUBLE RECOVERY

         The Purchasers shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the
         same loss in respect of any fact, matter, event or circumstance giving
         rise to a claim under Clause 11 (Specific Indemnities), the Warranties,
         the Tax Deed or any other provision of this Agreement.

6.       RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES

6.1      If the Purchasers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them is or
         may be entitled to recover from some other person (including insurers
         but excluding any member of


                                       145
<PAGE>
         the Group) any loss or damage which gives rise to any claim under the
         Warranties or any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchasers
         shall or shall procure that the Company or the relevant Subsidiary
         shall take all appropriate steps to enforce that recovery (keeping the
         Sellers informed on a timely basis of any action so taken) before
         taking any action (other than notifying the Sellers of the claim)
         against the Sellers, provided that such steps will not, or are not
         likely, (in each case, in the reasonable opinion of the Purchasers) to
         materially adversely affect the goodwill of any member of the Group
         save that this proviso shall not apply in relation to the recovery by
         the Companies and the Subsidiaries of debts owed to them by customers,
         in respect of which the Purchasers shall procure that the Companies and
         the Subsidiaries shall seek to recover the same in the normal and
         proper course of business and in accordance with the relevant periods
         for payment.

         If the Purchasers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them do
         not take the appropriate steps to enforce any such recovery, the
         Sellers may refer the matter to a Queens' Counsel of at least 20 years
         call jointly agreed upon between the Purchasers and the Sellers or
         (failing such agreement) appointed, at the request of either the
         Purchaser or the Seller at any time, by the President from time to time
         of the Law Society in England and Wales (the "Queens' Counsel"), who
         shall then determine whether the goodwill of any member of the Group
         would be materially adversely affected if the Purchasers, the
         Companies, the Subsidiaries took the appropriate steps to enforce such
         recovery. His decision shall be communicated in writing to the
         Purchasers and the Sellers shall be final and binding upon the
         Purchaser and the Sellers, save in the event of manifest error. The
         costs of the Queens Counsel shall be borne as to half by the Sellers
         and half by the Purchasers in connection with all matters specified in
         this Paragraph.

6.2      If, notwithstanding any other provision of this Schedule, any payment
         is made by the Sellers in or towards the settlement of any claim made
         under the Warranties and the Purchasers, the Companies, the
         Subsidiaries or any of them subsequently recovers or procures the
         recovery from a third party (including insurers) of an amount which is
         directly referable to that claim (and, in the event that the
         Purchasers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them becomes
         entitled after payment by the Sellers to make recovery provided that
         such steps will not, or are not likely to (in both cases, in the
         reasonable opinion of the Purchaser) adversely affect the goodwill of
         any member of the Group, the Purchasers undertake to procure that all
         necessary steps are taken to enforce that recovery at the cost and
         expense of the Sellers) the Purchasers shall or shall procure that the
         relevant Company or Subsidiary shall forthwith repay upon such


                                       146
<PAGE>
         recovery to the Sellers an amount equal to the amount (including
         interest (if any)) recovered from the third party.

7.       CONDUCT OF CLAIMS

         If the Purchasers, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of them or
         any other member of the Purchasers' Group becomes aware of any actual
         or threatened assessment, claim, action or demand by a third party
         against any of them (including without limitation any competent
         authority in relation to the Environment) (a "third party claim") which
         causes or is reasonably likely to cause the Sellers to be liable under
         the Warranties:

         (a)      the Purchasers shall at the written request of the Seller take
                  or procure that the relevant Company or Subsidiary shall take
                  such action as the Sellers may reasonably require to avoid,
                  contest, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or defend the
                  third party claim (including, but without limitation, making
                  counter claims and exercising all rights of set off against
                  third parties) provided that the Sellers shall indemnify the
                  Purchasers, and each Company and Subsidiary and all other
                  members of the Purchasers' Group against all costs reasonably
                  incurred by them in complying with their respective
                  obligations under this Paragraph and provided further that
                  such action will not or is not likely to, in both cases, in
                  the reasonable opinion of the Purchasers adversely affect the
                  goodwill of any member of the Group.

         (b)      the Purchasers will not (and will procure that each Company
                  and Subsidiary and all other members of the Purchasers' Group
                  will not) make or attempt to make any admission of liability,
                  agreement, settlement or compromise in relation to a third
                  party claim without the consent of the Sellers (that consent
                  not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and

         (c)      the Purchasers shall in any event keep the Sellers informed as
                  to the steps which are being taken in connection with the
                  third party claim.

8.       DUTY TO MITIGATE

         The Purchasers shall and shall procure that the Companies and the
         Subsidiaries and any other relevant member of the Purchasers' Group
         shall in relation to any loss or liability which might give rise to a
         claim under the Warranties against the Sellers (were none of the
         limitations save this Paragraph 8 to apply) take all reasonable steps
         to avoid or mitigate that loss or liability.

         time as is commensurate with the time periods set out in paragraph 2.1
         of this Schedule 5 retain and preserve all books, records, documents
         and information (including information recorded or retained in any
         electronic form) of or relating to each Company and Subsidiary and
         their business which are or may be relevant in connection with any
         claim brought by the Purchasers against the Sellers under the
         Warranties or any other provision of this Agreement for so long as any
         actual or prospective claims remain outstanding.

         such shorter period as may be determined by the Purchasers' Actuary and

         excess of the Transfer Amount made under paragraph 5.1 having regard to
         the assumptions set out in the Actuary's Letter.

         "Interest" means interest at the rate set out in Clause 3.4 of this
         Agreement.

         "Interim Period" means the period from Completion to the day before the
         Pension Transfer Date (both dates included).

         "Participating Company" means Geesink Norba Limited.

         "Payment Date" means the date which is seven days after the Transfer

         "Sellers' Scheme" means the PD Pension Plan established by a trust deed
         dated 30 March 1949.

         "Supplementary Transfer Amount" has the meaning set out in the
         Actuary's Letter.

         "Timing Adjustment" is the rate determined as set out in the Actuary's
         Letter.

         "Transfer Amount" has the meaning set out in the Actuary's Letter.

         However, where the Sellers' Scheme is in receipt of a pension sharing
         order or other provision in section 28(1) of the Welfare Reform and
         Pensions Act 1999 in respect of a Transferring Employee, the Transfer
         Amount shall be reduced by the value of the pension debit applied to
         that person's benefits in accordance with the applicable legislation
         and by the amount of the charges that are to be deducted from that
         person's entitlement insofar as the calculation of the Transfer Amount
         has not already taken such pension debit and charges into account.

         "Transferring Employees" means those Relevant Employees:-

         (a)      who become members of the Purchasers' Scheme on the Pension
                  Transfer Date; and

         (b)      who no later than four weeks after the Pension Transfer Date

                  the trustees of the Sellers' Scheme to the transfer of an
                  appropriate sum from the Sellers' Scheme to the Purchasers'
                  Scheme in place of all of the benefits payable in respect of
                  their membership of the Sellers' Scheme.

1.2      The following provisions have the same meanings given to them under the
         provisions of the Sellers' Scheme:

         "Pensionable Earnings"

1.3      References in this Schedule to paragraphs are to paragraphs of this
         Schedule.

1.4      For the avoidance of doubt the provisions of clause 14 of the Agreement

                  to be unreasonably withheld);

                                       157
<PAGE>
         (g)      notify the trustees of the Sellers' Scheme of the names of
                  those Relevant Employees (if any) who cease to be employed by
                  the Purchasers during the Interim Period; and

         (h)      complete such documents as the trustee of the Sellers' Scheme
                  reasonably requires.

2.3      In the event that any contribution due to the Sellers' Scheme in
         accordance with paragraph 2.2 is not paid by the due date the
         Purchasers shall procure that the Participating Company shall pay
         Interest on the over due amount.

2.4      The Purchasers will promptly deliver to the Sellers drafts before they
         are issued and copies once they are issued of all notices and
         announcements relating to the Sellers' Scheme or the Purchasers' Scheme
         supplied to the Relevant Employees before the Pension Transfer Date.

2.5      The Purchasers undertake that during the Interim Period the
         Participating Company shall if so required by the Sellers in writing,
         nominate the Seller (or such other person as the Seller may direct) as:

         (a)      the appropriate person under section 21(9) of the Pensions Act
                  1995;

         (b)      its representative for the purposes of section 58(4) of the
                  Pensions Act 1995, as modified by the Occupational Pension
                  Schemes (Minimum Funding Requirement and Actuarial Valuation)
                  Regulations 1996; and

         (c)      its agent for the purposes of consultation under section 35(5)
                  of the Pensions Act 1995.

2.6      The Sellers undertake to procure that the Sellers' Scheme will not be
         terminated or amended if any amendment would have the effect of
         reducing the Transfer Amount prior to the payment of the Transfer
         Amount and the Supplementary Transfer Amount in accordance with
         paragraph 5 or, if sooner, 12 months after the Pension Transfer Date.

2.7      The Sellers and the Purchasers shall use their best endeavours to
         procure that while the Relevant Employees are members of the Sellers'
         Scheme their employment shall be contracted-out employment (within the
         meaning of section 8 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993) by reference to
         the Sellers' Scheme.

2.8      The Sellers undertake with the Purchasers that they will not take any
         actions (other than those required by law or in accordance with the
         provisions of this Schedule) to

                                       158
<PAGE>

         persuade Relevant Employees not to consent to become Transferring
         Members. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and the Purchasers
         agree that this paragraph 2.8 will not prevent the Sellers from
         providing information to any Relevant Employee in connection with, and
         in particular regarding his or her benefits under, the Sellers' Scheme.

3.       THE PURCHASERS' SCHEME

3.1      The Purchasers will establish or nominate the Purchasers' Scheme before
         the Pension Transfer Date and will procure that the Participating
         Company will participate in the Purchasers' Scheme. All Relevant
         Employees then employed by the Participating Company who have not
         attained normal pension date will be invited to become members of the
         Purchasers' Scheme with effect from the Pension Transfer Date. The
         Purchasers' Scheme shall remain in full force and effect for at least
         the remainder of the Future Period.

3.2      The Purchasers' Scheme shall provide benefits in accordance with
         paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 and shall:-

         (a)      be a final salary scheme, designed to be approved under
                  Chapter I of Part XIV of ICTA or capable of such approval;
                  and/or

         (b)      be a money purchase scheme, designed to be approved under
                  Chapter I or Chapter IV of Part XIV of ICTA and be either (i)
                  a contracted-out scheme for the purposes of Section 9(3) of
                  the Pension Schemes Act 1993 or (ii) an appropriate scheme for
                  the purposes of Part III of the Pension Schemes Act 1993;

         and the Purchasers will use their reasonable endeavours to procure that
         the Purchasers' Scheme accepts the transfer to the Purchasers' Scheme
         of the accrued rights of the Transferring Employees including the
         liabilities of the Sellers' Scheme under the Pension Schemes Act 1993
         in respect of the contracted-out service of each Transferring Employee.
         For the avoidance of doubt, if the Purchasers' Scheme is a final salary
         scheme which is not a contracted-out scheme for the purposes of Section
         9(2B) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 the Purchasers will also
         establish or nominate a money purchase scheme as set out in (b) above.

3.3      Subject to receipt of the Transfer Amount, the Purchasers will procure
         that

         (a)      where the Purchasers' Scheme is of a type described in
                  paragraph 3.2(a), the Purchasers' Scheme will provide for and
                  in respect of each Transferring

                                       159
<PAGE>

         Employee benefits in respect of Pensionable Service in the Sellers'
         Scheme before the Pension Transfer Date which, in the opinion of the
         Purchasers' Actuary, are broadly equivalent in value calculated on the
         assumptions in the Actuary's Letter (such calculations to be verified
         by the Sellers' Actuary) to the benefits that would have been provided
         for and in respect of the member under the Sellers' Scheme in respect
         of Pensionable Service before the Pension Transfer Date if the member
         had remained in service as a member of the Sellers' Scheme up to the
         date of retirement, death or leaving service; or

         (b)      where the Purchasers' Scheme is of a type described in
                  paragraph 3.2(b), the proportion of the Transfer Amount
                  applicable to each Transferring Employee is credited to that
                  Transferring Employee's account in the Purchasers' Scheme
                  without any deduction for expenses (other than reasonable
                  ongoing investment management expenses).

(2)      On the agreement of the calculations in paragraph 4.1 below, the
         Purchasers will within one month prepare individual communications for
         each Relevant Employee (such communications to be agreed by the
         Sellers) which shall set out the transfer terms to be offered to them.

3.4      Subject to receipt of the Supplementary Transfer Amount or any other
         amount greater than the Transfer Amount (as adjusted in accordance with
         paragraph 5.1), the Purchasers will use all reasonable endeavours in
         conjunction with the Sellers to ensure that those of the Transferring
         Employees with continued rights to pre-1989 Inland Revenue Limits will
         retain the same rights in the Purchasers' Scheme and,

         (a)      where the Purchasers' Scheme is of a type described in
                  paragraph 3.2(a) the Purchasers will procure that for each
                  Transferring Employee the Purchasers' Scheme will provide for
                  the remainder of the Future Period defined benefits in respect
                  of service after the Pension Transfer Date with the
                  Participating Company which, in the opinion of the Purchasers'
                  Actuary, are broadly equivalent in value (taking account of
                  any improvements in the method of remuneration of such
                  Transferring Employee) calculated on the assumptions in the
                  Actuary's Letter (such calculations to be verified by the
                  Sellers' Actuary) to the benefits that would have been
                  provided under the Sellers' Scheme for and in respect of the
                  employee based on such service had the employee remained a
                  contributing member of the Sellers' Scheme and that the
                  contributions payable by each Transferring Member (if any)
                  during the remainder of the Future Period will not be higher
                  than the contributions payable by the employee to the Sellers'
                  Scheme immediately prior to the

                                       160
<PAGE>

                  Pension Transfer Date, unless such a change in the
                  contribution rate can be justified following an improvement in
                  benefit provision under the Purchasers' Scheme; and/or

         (b)      where the Purchasers' Scheme is of a type described in
                  paragraph 3.2(b) the Purchasers will procure that in respect
                  of Transferring Employees employer contributions will be
                  credited to the accounts of Transferring Employees during the
                  remainder of the Future Period under a contribution structure
                  which, in the opinion of the Purchasers' Actuary, is broadly
                  equivalent in value (taking account of any improvements in the
                  method of remuneration of such Transferring Employee)
                  calculated on the assumptions in the Actuary's Letter (such
                  calculations to be verified by the Sellers' Actuary) to the
                  defined benefits that would have been provided under the
                  Sellers' Scheme for and in respect of the employee had the
                  employee remained a contributing member of the Sellers'
                  Scheme.

3.5      The Purchasers will procure that the Transferring Employees will
         receive fair and equal treatment as members of the Purchasers' Scheme.

4.       THE TRANSFER PAYMENT

4.1      The Sellers shall procure that the Sellers' Actuary makes a provisional
         calculation of the Transfer Amount and the Supplementary Transfer
         Amount as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event not later
         than two months before the Pension Transfer Date (assuming for these
         purposes that the Pension Transfer Date ends on a date which is six
         months after Completion and further assuming that all Relevant
         Employees are to be Transferring Employees) and notifies the
         Purchasers' Actuary of the amount for verification by the Purchasers'
         Actuary. If the Purchasers' Actuary is unable to agree the Sellers'
         Actuary's calculations within one month of his receipt of the
         calculations either party may refer the matter to an independent
         actuary pursuant to paragraph 4.4 below.

4.2      The Sellers and the Purchasers shall as soon as reasonably practicable
         and in any event not later than two months after the Pension Transfer
         Date provide the Sellers' Actuary and the Purchasers' Actuary with
         documents and information in their respective possession or control as
         the Sellers' Actuary and the Purchasers' Actuary may reasonably require
         in order to calculate and verify the Transfer Amount and the
         Supplementary Transfer Amount.

                                       161
<PAGE>

4.3      The Sellers shall procure that the Sellers' Actuary calculates as soon
         as reasonably practicable and in any event not later than four months
         after the Pension Transfer Date the Transfer Amount and the
         Supplementary Transfer Amount and notifies the Purchasers' Actuary of
         the amount for verification by the Purchasers' Actuary. If the
         Purchasers' Actuary is unable to agree the Sellers' Actuary's
         calculations within one month of his receipt of the calculations either
         party may refer the matter to an independent actuary pursuant to
         paragraph 4.4 below.

4.4      Any dispute between the Sellers' Actuary and the Purchasers' Actuary
         concerning the mathematics of calculating the Transfer Amount, the
         Supplementary Transfer Amount or the Future Period and any disagreement
         between them arising under paragraphs 3.3(a), 3.4(a) and 3.4(b) shall,
         in the absence of agreement between them, be referred to an independent
         Actuary agreed by the Sellers and the Purchasers or (failing agreement
         within 7 days of a written request from one party to the other to agree
         to the appointment of such an actuary) appointed at the request of the
         Sellers or the Purchasers by or on behalf of the President for the time
         being of the Institute of Actuaries. The decision of any such
         independent actuary shall be final and his expenses shall be borne
         equally by the Sellers and the Purchasers or otherwise in his absolute
         discretion as he may determine. The independent actuary shall act as an
         expert not as an arbitrator.

5.       PAYMENT OF THE TRANSFER AMOUNT AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY TRANSFER AMOUNT

5.1      Subject to them being satisfied that the Purchasers have met or will
         meet its obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3 above and to the consent
         of the Inland Revenue having been obtained to such a payment, the
         Sellers will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that the trustees
         of the Sellers' Scheme transfer to the trustees of the Purchasers'
         Scheme assets mutually agreed between the trustees of the Sellers'
         Scheme and the trustees of the Purchasers' Scheme equal in value on the
         basis set out in the Actuary's letter to the Transfer Amount and the
         Supplementary Transfer Amount (adjusted by the Timing Adjustment during
         the period from the Pension Transfer Date to the Payment Date) or
         otherwise in cash (subject to deduction for reasonable expenses
         incurred in realising assets).

5.2      If and to the extent that the sum (if any) paid by the trustees of the
         Sellers' Scheme under paragraph 5.1 above is less than the Transfer
         Amount (as adjusted and subject to the deduction referred to in
         paragraph 5.1), the Sellers (as principal and not as guarantor) will
         itself pay the difference between the Transfer Amount (as adjusted and
         subject to the deduction referred to in paragraph 5.1) and the amount
         actually paid (if

                                       162
<PAGE>

         any) to the Purchasers (as an adjustment to the Purchase Price), which
         amount shall be called "the Shortfall".

5.3      If a payment is made under paragraph 5.2 the Purchasers will procure
         that the Participating Company shall make a payment equal to the
         Shortfall to the Purchasers' Scheme within five Business Days of
         receipt. If the Participating Company's liability to corporation tax
         applicable to its profits is reduced as a result of the payment of this
         amount together with Interest thereon into the Purchasers' Scheme the
         Purchasers shall repay in cash to the Sellers an amount equal to such
         deduction (as an adjustment to the Purchase Price) within seven days of
         the date on which the Shortfall is paid to the Purchasers' Scheme.

6.       ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS

         Any additional voluntary contributions made to the Sellers' Scheme by
         any Relevant Employee (and the moneys, interest and benefits derived
         from those contributions) which are used to provide money purchase
         benefits (as defined in the Pension Schemes Act 1993) shall be
         disregarded for the purposes of calculating the Transfer Amount, but
         the Sellers shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that the
         trustees of the Sellers' Scheme will as soon as practicable after the
         Pension Transfer Date transfer to the Purchasers' Scheme (without
         penalty or deduction) the assets and/or the amount standing to the
         credit of each Transferring Employee in respect of additional voluntary
         contributions paid to the Sellers' Scheme.

7.       MISCELLANEOUS

7.1      Neither the Purchasers the Participating Company nor any company
         directly or indirectly controlled by or connected with it will
         encourage or initiate any action or provide financial assistance for
         the purpose of requiring the trustees of the Sellers' Scheme to pay a
         larger amount than the Transfer Amount and the Supplementary Transfer
         Amount (adjusted by the Timing Adjustment).

7.2      If after Completion any Relevant Employee ceases to be employed by the
         Participating Company and becomes employed by an employer associated
         with the Participating Company (within the meaning of section 590A of
         the ICTA), that Relevant Employee will be deemed to be an employee of
         the Participating Company for the purposes of this Schedule, and the
         Purchasers will comply and will procure that such other employer
         complies with the obligations imposed upon the Purchasers and the
         Participating Company by this Schedule in relation to that employee.

respect thereof payable pursuant to Clause 3 (Purchase Price)) shall be
allocated as between each of Geesink Group BV, Norba AB and Geesink Norba
Limited in the same proportion as detailed above.
