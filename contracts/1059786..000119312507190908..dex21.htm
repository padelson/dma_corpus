11 prepare or cause to be prepared a statement (the " _Additional Share Purchase
Price Statement_ ") setting forth the number of the Additional Purchase Price
Shares or the cash amount that the Purchaser believes is due in accordance
with Section 2.4, together with the basis for calculating such number or
amount in reasonable detail and a copy of the consolidated accounts on which
basis the Actual Revenues have been determined; and (ii) deliver or cause to
be delivered such Additional Share Purchase Price Statement to the

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

In the event that the Shareholders Representative objects to the Purchasers
calculation of the Additional Purchase Price Shares or the cash amount set
forth in the Additional Share Purchase Price Statement or requires further
information in order to perform such calculations or determine such number or
amount, then within 10 days after the delivery to the
Shareholders Representative of the Additional Share Purchase Price Statement
(the " _Initial Response Period_ "), the Shareholders Representative shall
deliver to the Purchaser a written notice (an " _Initial Objection Notice_
"): (i) describing in reasonable detail the Shareholders Representatives
objections to the Purchasers calculation of the number or amount set forth in
the Additional Share Purchase Price Statement and containing a
statement setting forth the Actual Revenues and the number of Additional
Purchase Price Shares or the cash amount determined by the Shareholders
Representative to be correct; or (ii) requesting additional information from
the Purchaser that the Shareholders Representative requires in order to
perform such calculations or determine such number or amount (which
information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order to perform such
calculations, shall be provided by the Purchaser within 15 days after the
Purchasers receipt of the Initial Objection Notice). If the Shareholders
Representative does not deliver an Initial Objection Notice to Purchaser
during the Initial Response Period, then the Purchasers calculation of the
number or amount set forth in the Additional Share Purchase Price Statement
shall be binding and conclusive on the Purchaser, the Selling Shareholders and
the Shareholders Representative. If the Shareholders Representative
delivers an Initial Objection Notice to the Purchaser accompanied by a request
for additional information from the Purchaser as described above during the
Initial Response Period, then the Shareholders Representative shall have an
additional 20 days after receiving from the Purchaser all of the information
to be provided by the Purchaser (the " _Final Response Period_ ") to deliver
to the Purchaser a written notice (a " _Final Objection Notice_ ") describing
in reasonable detail the Shareholders Representatives objections to
Purchasers calculations of the number or amount set forth in the Additional
Share Purchase Price Statement accompanied by a statement setting forth
the Actual Revenues and the number of Additional Purchase Price Shares or
cash amount determined by the Shareholders Representative to be correct. If
the Shareholders Representative has requested additional information during
the Initial Response Period and does not deliver a Final Objection Notice to
Purchaser during the Final Response Period, then the Purchasers calculation
of the number or amount set forth in the Additional Share Purchase Price
Statement shall be binding and conclusive on the Purchaser, the Selling
Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative. If the Shareholders
Representative delivers an Initial Objection Notice or Final Objection Notice,
as the case may be, accompanied by a statement setting forth the Actual
Revenues and the number of Additional Purchase Price Shares or cash amount,
determined by the Shareholders Representative to   

---|---|--- 



 

12  be correct to the Purchaser during either the Initial Response Period or the
Final Response Period in accordance with this Section 2.4, and if
the Shareholders Representative and the Purchaser are unable to agree upon
the calculation of the number or amount set forth in the Additional Share
Purchase Price Statement within 30 days after such Initial Objection Notice or
Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, is delivered to the Purchaser,
the dispute shall be finally settled by a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Shareholders
Representative. The determination by the independent accounting firm of the
disputed number of Additional Purchase Price Shares or the cash amount, if
any, shall be conclusive and binding on Purchaser, the Selling Shareholders
and the Shareholders Representative. The Purchaser and the Selling
Shareholders shall each bear and pay 50% of the fees and other expenses of
such independent accounting firm (the " _Post-Closing Payment Fees_ ").

contractor of or to any of the Acquired Companies) any right or claim upon a
change of control of an Acquired Company or similar event

interpretation or announcement by, any of the Acquired Companies which
would materially increase the expense of maintaining any Plan above the level
of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in the Companys accounts. No Plan provides health benefits that are
not fully insured through an insurance contract. None of the Acquired
Companies has agreed to provide any current Acquired Company Employee with any
compensation or benefits pursuant to an agreement with a former employer of
such individuals. Except as set forth in Part 3.14(e) of the Disclosure
Letter, none of the Acquired Companies have any Liabilities to any former
employees of an Acquired Company under any of the Plans. 

---|--- 


     | (c) | Each of the Plans has been established, operated and

Companies have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under, applicable Legal Requirements. All contributions
required to be made by the Acquired Companies to any Plan have been timely
made or accrued and all contributions for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date which are not yet due will have been paid or accrued on or prior
to the Closing Date. Other than in relation to acquired rights of the
employees, each Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the date of this Agreement, without liability to any of the Acquired
Companies or the Purchaser (other than ordinary administration expenses).
There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened or reasonably anticipated by the Portuguese Labour and
Social Security Authorities or any other Governmental Body with respect to any
Plan.

     | (d) | Except as set forth in Part 3.14(d) of the Disclosure Letter
Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will

events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise and
whether or not under any Plan), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits in relation to employment matters. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Except as set forth in Part 3.14(e) of the Disclosure Letter

set forth in Part 3.14(j) of the Disclosure Letter, there are no actions,
suits, written claims, labor disputes or grievances relating to any labor,
safety or discrimination matters involving any current or former employee of
any of the Acquired Companies, including any charges of non-payment of
overtime, unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints. To the
Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to or provide a basis
for any material action, suit, claim, labor dispute or grievance. No Acquired
Company is involved in a dispute with any trade union, association of trade
unions, employees association, works council or other body representing
employees.  
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Each of the Acquired Companies is up to date in the payment
and satisfaction of its obligations regarding any Acquired Company Employee,
including with respect to salaries, payment in kind, compensation, insurance,

Companys Knowledge, no Person has threatened to commence any Legal
Proceeding: (i) that involves any of the Acquired Companies or any of the

any Acquired Company Service); or 
---|---|--- 



 

32 other Encumbrance upon or with respect to any asset owned or used by any of

in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of the assets subject
thereto or materially impair the operations of any of the Acquired Companies). 
---|---|--- 
Except as set forth in Part 3.17 of the Disclosure Letter, none of the
Acquired Companies is or will be required to make any filing with or give

   4. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS 
---|--- 

Each of the Selling Shareholders represents and warrants, to and for
the benefit of the Indemnitees, as follows:



     | 4.1 | Ownership of Shares. Such Selling Shareholder owns the
number and class or series of Shares set forth opposite such Selling
Shareholders name in _Schedule I_ , free and clear of any Encumbrance and
such Selling Shareholder is entitled to sell and transfer to the Purchaser the
full legal and beneficial ownership of such Shares free and clear of any
Encumbrance on the terms of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | 4.2 | Capacity and Authority of Selling Shareholders; Binding
Nature of Agreement. Such Selling Shareholder has the absolute and
unrestricted right, power and capacity to enter into and to perform such
Selling Shareholders obligations under this Agreement and under each other
agreement, document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by this
Agreement to which any Selling Shareholder is or will be a party; and, if
applicable, the execution, delivery and performance by such Selling
Shareholder of this Agreement and of each such other agreement, document and
instrument have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
such Selling Shareholder and, if necessary, its board of directors and
shareholders. This Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
referred to in or contemplated by this Agreement to which any Selling
Shareholder is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Selling Shareholder, enforceable against such Selling Shareholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to: (i) laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors; and (ii) rules
of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. No Legal Proceedings are current, pending or threatened to restrain
(or which would have the effect of so restraining) the entry into,
performance of, compliance with and enforcement of any of the obligations of
such Selling Shareholder hereunder and so far as such Selling Shareholder is
aware there are no circumstances which might give rise to any such Legal
Proceedings or the threat of any such Legal Proceedings. 
---|---|--- 



 

33 delivery or performance by such Selling Shareholder of this Agreement or any
of the other agreements, documents or instruments referred to in this
Agreement; nor (2) the consummation by such Selling Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any such other agreement,
document or instrument, will (with or without notice or lapse of time),
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of: (a) any of
the provisions of the charter documents, if any, of such Selling Shareholder;
(b) any resolution adopted by the stockholders, the board of directors or
any committee of the board of directors of such Selling Shareholder, if
applicable; or (c) any provision of any contract to which such Selling
Shareholder is bound. Except for the filing of a Form 4 with applicable Tax
authorities in Portugal, none of the Selling Shareholders is or will be
required to make any filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any
Consent from, any Person in connection with: (i) the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any of the other agreements referred to in
this Agreement; or (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   5. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MIPS AND THE PURCHASER 
---|--- 

Each of MIPS and the Purchaser jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Selling Shareholders as follows:



     | 5.1 | Due Organization. The Purchaser and MIPS are, respectively,
a company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and of the State of Portugal and have full power and
authority to conduct their businesses in the manner in which their businesses

which their assets are currently owned and used.  
---|---|--- 



     | 5.2 | Non-Contravention; Consents. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Neither: (i) the execution, delivery or performance by MIPS

or instruments referred to in this Agreement; nor (ii) the consummation by
MIPS and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of such other agreements, documents or instruments, will (with or without
notice or lapse of time) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation
or breach of: (A) any of the provisions of the articles of associations of
MIPS or of the Purchaser; (B) any resolution adopted by the stockholders, the
board of directors or any committee of the board of directors of MIPS or of
the Purchaser; or (C) any provision of any material contract to which MIPS or
the Purchaser are bound. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Except as may be required under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, the Delaware General Corporation Law or any applicable
antitrust or competition laws (and except for the filing of a Form 4 with
applicable Tax authorities in Portugal), MIPS and the Purchaser will not be
required to make any filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any
Consent from, any Person in connection with: (i) the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any of the other agreements referred to in
this Agreement; or (ii) the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


 

34 Purchaser have the absolute and unrestricted right, power and authority to

other agreement, document and instrument have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of MIPS and of the Purchaser and, if necessary,

---|---|--- 


   6. | INDEMNIFICATION 
---|--- 



     | 6.1 | Survival of Representations, Etc. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to Section 6.1(c), the representations and
warranties made by the parties in this Agreement (including the Specified
Representations) shall survive the Closing and shall expire on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ ") as from which
date all liability for breach of those representations and warranties shall
cease and any amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account shall be
held or released in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the Termination Date, any
Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the
Shareholders Representative a Claim Notice (as defined in, and in accordance
with, _Schedule XII_ ) asserting a claim for recovery under Section 6.2 based
on such alleged breach (the " _Claim_ "), then the Claim asserted in such
Claim Notice shall survive the Termination Date until such time as such Claim
is fully and finally resolved. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
of the Selling Shareholders, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised
by the Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a
result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or
knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives, other
than information disclosed in the Disclosure Letter.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Nothing contained in Section 6.1 shall limit any rights or
remedy of any Indemnitee for claims based on fraud. 
---|---|--- 


     | 6.2 | Indemnification by Selling Shareholders. From and after the
Closing (but subject to Section 6.1 and to the last paragraph of this Section
6.2), the Selling Shareholders (the " _Indemnitors_ ") shall hold harmless
and indemnify each of the Indemnitees or the relevant Acquired Company (in
each case without duplication) from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Indemnitees or the relevant Acquired Company (in each
case without duplication) for any Damages which are incurred by any of the
Indemnitees or any of the Acquired Companies and which arise from or are a
result of: 
---|---|--- 


     | (a) | any breach of any representation or warranty made by any
Selling Shareholder in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (in
each case without duplication of Damages where the circumstances or facts
give rise to a breach of multiple representations and warranties); 
---|---|--- 



 

35 Selling Shareholders prior to or at the Closing which any Acquired Company is
obligated to pay; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | any Post-Closing Payment Fees payable by the Selling
Shareholders. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (A) with
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section 4, a
Selling Shareholder shall only have liability as to a breach of such
representations and warranties as they relate to such Selling Shareholder (and
not as they relate to any other Selling Shareholder); (B) if prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing, an Indemnitee asserts a claim
for indemnification under Section 6 (the " _Applicable Claim_ ") for a breach
of Specified Representations other than Section 4.1, such Indemnitee shall
seek recourse with respect to such Applicable Claim against
the Indemnification Escrow Amount before seeking recourse directly against
the Selling Shareholders (it being understood, however, that if the amount of
Damages claimed by such Indemnitee to be owing with respect to the Applicable
Claim exceeds the portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount that is not
subject to a prior indemnification claim and that is available for such
Applicable Claim, then, subject to the other limitations contained in this
Section 6, such Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek recourse directly
against the Selling Shareholders for such excess amount); and (C) if prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing, an Indemnitee asserts an Applicable
Claim for a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.1, such Indemnitee shall seek recourse with respect to such Applicable Claim
against the Indemnification Escrow Amount before seeking recourse directly
against such breaching Selling Shareholder (it being understood, however,
that if the amount of Damages claimed by such Indemnitee to be owing with
respect to the Applicable Claim _exceeds_ the portion of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount attributable to such breaching Selling Shareholder that is not
subject to a prior indemnification claim and that is available for such
Applicable Claim, then, subject to the other limitations contained in this
Section 6, such Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek recourse directly against
such Selling Shareholder for such excess amount).

If any Acquired Company incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as
a result of or in connection with any breach of any representation and
warranty, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Purchaser as an
Indemnitee but always without duplication) the Purchaser shall also be deemed,
by virtue of its ownership of the shares of the Acquired Companies, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such breach.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties agree that any particular indemnification Claim pursuant to this
Section 6.2 may only be brought against the Selling Shareholders by MIPS, or a
person designated by MIPS as a person being entitled to act on behalf of all
other Indemnitees seeking to assert an indemnification Claim against a Selling
Shareholder).



     | 6.3 | Limitations; Exclusivity; Other Considerations. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

No Damages arising from any individual breach of a representation and warranty
shall count toward the satisfaction of the Deductible (as defined below)
or otherwise be counted towards Damages unless the breach of such
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3 (or multiple breaches of the
  

---|---|--- 



 

36  same representation and warranty all of which are based on similar
circumstances or facts, including where such circumstances or facts give rise
to claims by multiple parties (without double counting)), without regard to
any materiality qualifiers contained therein (including the word "Material"
before "Contract" in Section 3.10(d) and the word "material" before
other words or phrases contained in Section 3, but excluding the reference to
"Material" before the word "Contract" in the first sentence of Section
3.10(c)) and without regard to the reference to EUR 10.000 in Section 3.5(a),
results in Damages in excess of $10,000 individually (a " _Qualified Claim_
"). 

---|--- 



     | (b) | The Indemnitors shall not be required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 6.2 until such time as the total
amount of all Damages arising from Qualified Claims that have been incurred
by any one or more of the Indemnitees exceeds, and only to the extent that
such Damages exceed, $500,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ "); 
---|---|--- 


     | (c) | In the event that any Indemnitee or any Acquired Company
incurs Damages resulting from an IP Breach (as defined below), and provided
that such Damages would, in accordance with Sections 6.2, 6.3(a) and 6.3(b),
entitle an Indemnitee to a claim for indemnification hereunder, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for all
such Damages in excess of $500,000 and less than or equal to $2,500,000, the
Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive indemnification up to 50% of the
Damages to which the Indemnitees are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section
6.2. If Damages (for which Indemnitees are otherwise entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2) incurred as a result of IP
Breaches are in excess of $2,500,000, the Indemnitees shall be entitled to
receive payment under Section 6.2 of up to $1,000,000 plus the amount by which
such Damages incurred are greater than $2,500,000; it being understood that,
except in the case of fraud, under no circumstances shall Indemnitors ever
have any liability under any IP Breach for Damages that exceed the amounts
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account. For the purposes of the
foregoing " _IP Breach_ " means a breach of a representation and warranty
related to Intellectual Property and/or to Intellectual Property Rights
(whether made under Section 3.9 or otherwise). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Recourse by the Indemnitees to the Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy for Damages
resulting from the matters referred to in Section 6.2 or 6.3; therefore, the
Purchaser expressly agrees and accepts to exclude any other right, action,
remedy defense, exception, claim or means of protection otherwise available in
connection therewith and hereby expressly renounces to the fullest extent
permitted by law to the rights it may have under law or contract to seek the
rescission of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The limitations set forth in Sections 6.3(a), (b), (c) and
(d), (as may be applicable) shall not apply: (i) in the case of fraud; (ii) to
a breach of any of the Specified Representations; or (iii) to the matters
referred to in Sections 6.2(b) and 6.2(c). 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | The limitations set forth in Sections 6.3(a) and (b) shall
not apply to a breach of the representation and warranty made under Section
3.4(i).  
---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

When assessing the Damages claimed by the Indemnitee(s) or the Acquired
Companies and finally to be indemnified by the Indemnitors pursuant to   

---|---|--- 



 

37  Sections 6.2 and 6.3, an arbitrator may take into account, all evidence that
such arbitrator may consider to be fair and just, including, among other
things, in reducing Damages, evidence relating to: 

---|--- 

(i) the amounts recoverable by such Indemnitee from any insurer or third
party in respect of such Damage net of the costs incurred in connection
recovering such amount such as, insurance premium increases;

(ii) any benefit consisting of an actual reduction in Taxes or social security
charges resulting from such Damage for the Indemnitee or any Acquired Company
net of any increase in Taxes such as a corresponding reduction in
Tax deductions or other tax detriments;

(iii) any action or omission taken after the Closing by any of the
Indemnitees, any Acquired Company, any other current or future affiliate of
MIPS or any Representative of the Indemnitees, any Acquired Company or any
such current or future affiliate, in any case to the extent that such action
or omission increases or decreases the amount of Damages resulting from a
particular matter; and

(iv) the fact that an amount of Damage in respect of Taxes or social
security charges corresponds only to a change in the time when an amount of
Taxes or social security charges should have been paid.



     | (h) | The Indemnitors shall not be liable to indemnify the
Indemnitees against Damages which would not have occurred but for either: (i)
a change, after the date hereof, of applicable law or Legal Requirements or
of its interpretation or application by Governmental Body; or (ii) a change,
after the Closing Date, of the accounting or Tax methods applied by the
Acquired Companies or any restructuring of the Acquired Companies. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | If: (i) there is a provision reflected in the Unaudited
Interim Account; (ii) an Indemnitee or an Acquired Company incurs Damages a
result of a breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 3;
and (iii) the provision referred to in clause "(i)" of this sentence relates
directly to the circumstances giving rise to the breach referred to in clause
"(ii)" of this sentence, Damages resulting from such breach shall be reduced
by the amount of such provision to the extent and only to the extent that such
provision has not been extinguished by prior reduction of such provision as a
result of its use for its intended purpose (e.g., if a provision exists as an
allowance for doubtful accounts and Acquired Company customers fail to pay
their obligations to the Acquired Companies, such failure to pay shall reduce
such provision and only after, and to the extent that, the provision has been
fully utilized, shall a Claim for an Acquired Company customers failure to
pay its obligations to the Acquired Companies arise). 
---|---|--- 


     | 6.4 | Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion
or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether
against any of the Acquired Companies, MIPS, the Purchaser or any other
Person) with respect to which any Indemnitor may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 6, the Purchaser shall have the right to, and shall, at the
Shareholders Representatives request, proceed with the defense of such claim
or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Shareholders Representative. If the Purchaser so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | each Indemnitor shall make available to the Purchaser any
documents and materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and 
---|---|--- 



 

38 compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that if the
Purchaser settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding
without the consent of the Shareholders Representative, such settlement,
adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the amount of
Damages incurred by MIPS, the Indemnitee, MIPS current or future affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) or any of their respective Representatives
(excluding the Selling Shareholders) in connection with such claim or Legal
Proceeding (it being understood that if the Purchaser requests that
the Shareholders Representative consent to a settlement, adjustment or
compromise, the Shareholders Representative shall not unreasonably withhold
or delay such consent). 
---|---|--- 
The Purchaser shall give the Shareholders Representative prompt notice of the
commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against the Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Companies; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of the
Purchaser to so notify the Shareholders Representative shall not limit any of
the obligations of the Indemnitors under Section 6 (except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If the
Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Shareholders Representative may proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders
Representative may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that the Purchaser
does not defend a claim or matter subject to indemnification as provided
above, any costs or expenses incurred or amounts paid by the Indemnitor in
connection with such matter shall be deemed Damages paid by the Indemnitor in
satisfaction of any indemnity obligation hereunder.



     | 6.5 | No Setoff. Subject to the other provisions of Section 6, the
Indemnitees shall not have the right to withhold and deduct any sum that may
be owed to any Indemnitee under Section 6 or pursuant to any other provision
of this Agreement or any other agreement referred to herein or attached hereto
from any amounts payable by the Purchaser to any Selling Shareholder, in any
capacity, other than from the Indemnification Escrow Amount as provided in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   7. | ADDITIONAL INDEMNITY 
---|--- 

The Parties further agree as set forth on _Schedule XIII_.



   8. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 



     | 8.1 | No Consequential, Incidental, Indirect, Special or Punitive
Damages. 
---|---|--- 

In no event shall any party be liable to any other party for any
consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages under this Agreement,
even if advised of the possibility of such damages.



 

39 ---|---|--- 

Other than in respect of the rights of the Indemnitees to the Indemnification
Escrow Account, the liability of the Selling Shareholder under this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby is several and not joint.



     | 8.3 | Shareholders Representative. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | The Purchaser shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Shareholders Representative on all matters relating to Sections 2, 6 and 7,
and _Schedule XII_ , and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Selling Shareholder by the Shareholders
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Selling Shareholder by the Shareholders Representative, as
fully binding upon such Selling Shareholder. 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | If the Shareholders Representative shall die, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, the
Selling Shareholders shall within ten days after such death, disability or
inability, appoint a successor to the Shareholders Representative and
immediately thereafter notify the Purchaser of the identity of such successor.
Any such successor shall succeed the Shareholders Representative as
Shareholders Representative hereunder. If for any reason there is no
Shareholders Representative at any time, all references herein to the
Shareholders Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Selling
Shareholders. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.4 | Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and
cause to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other
documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party may
reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of
carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


     | 8.5. | Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 6, Section 7,
_Schedule XII_ and _Schedule XIII_ , each party to this Agreement shall bear
and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are
incurred in the future by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Selling
Shareholders shall bear and pay all Shareholders Transaction Expenses (it
being understood that all fees and expenses payable to ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
shall be fees and expenses of the Selling Shareholders). 
---|---|---

permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in

     | (b) | Any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively

Agreement, any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
pursuant to Section 6 (and, at the option of the Indemnitee, any other claim
for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud,
relating to this Agreement after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved
exclusively in accordance with _Schedule XII_ (it being understood that
nothing in this Section 8.8(c) shall prevent the Purchaser from seeking
preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction).

     | 8.9. | Successors and Assigns. No party hereto may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the consent of
the Purchaser (in the case of an assignment or delegation by any Selling
Shareholder) or the Shareholders Representative (in the case of an assignment

not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action
or Legal Proceeding. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.11. | Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise
any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on
the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,

right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person
shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of
such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and
any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.  
---|---|---

unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or
unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue
to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.14. | Parties in Interest. Except for the expressly set forth in
this Agreement including the provisions of Section 6, none of the provisions

other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns (if any). 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.15. | Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules)
and the other agreements referred to herein set forth the entire understanding

43 Agreements. Each of the Selling Shareholders hereby gives any Consents
(including any waivers of applicable notice periods) that are required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
such Consents are required under the terms of any Contract to which such
Selling Shareholder is a party (including the Shareholders Agreement
entered into ay and between the Selling Shareholders in their capacity as
shareholders of the Company, dated as of May 13, 2005, as amended (the "
_Shareholders Agreement_ "), under any Charter Document, under any Legal
Requirement or otherwise. If and to the extent a Selling Shareholder is a

agreement with the Company, such Selling Shareholder agrees to the termination
of each and every of such Agreements, such termination to be effective

---|---|--- 



     | 8.18. | Efforts by MIPS. In consideration of MIPS being also an
Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement, MIPS undertakes to use its best efforts
to ensure that the Purchaser (or any successor or assign of the Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) shall have available all means
required to and shall perform its obligations under Section 2.3 of this
Agreement.

     | 8.19. | Registration. As promptly as practicable following the
issuance of Additional Purchase Price Shares to the Selling Shareholders
pursuant to Section 2.5, MIPS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

such Additional Purchase Price Shares, in any case only if (and to the extent
that) such Additional Purchase Price Shares are not eligible for resale in the
United States immediately after issuance pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If
it will be necessary to register the Additional Purchase Price Shares
pursuant to this Section 8.19, then, prior to the issuance of the Additional
Purchase Price Shares, MIPS shall enter into a customary form of registration
rights agreement, containing customary "black out" and other provisions with
the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Selling Shareholders). 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.20. | Board Membership. MIPS shall appoint Jose Epifanio Da

Chipidea brand in Portugal, the legal entity in Portugal shall be named "MIPS
Chipidea" promptly after the Closing. Other branding activities may be
determined after the Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.22. | Personal Guarantees. MIPS undertakes to obtain the release
of all personal guarantees issued by the Founders listed on _Schedule IXX_
within 90 (ninety) days after Closing and to keep the Founders fully
indemnified for any amounts which the Founders are required to pay under those
personal guarantees as a result of a breach by any of the Acquired Companies
of their payment obligations guaranteed thereunder; provided, however, that
the failure by MIPS to obtain the release of a personal guarantee will not be
considered as a breach of this Section 8.22 if the beneficiary of such
personal guarantee or other third party at issue finally does not agree to
grant such release. 
---|---|--- 



 

44 8.23.

 |

Directors and Officers Insurance. MIPS undertakes to all the Selling
Shareholders to cause the current insurance policy covering directors and

with number 23071042 (the " _Existing Policy_ ") to be kept in full force for
a period of 24 months after the Closing Date to cover all persons who are
covered under the Existing Policy immediately prior to the Closing in
