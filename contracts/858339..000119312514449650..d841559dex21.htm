ARTICLE III

 

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

3.1 _Exchange Ratio Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. During the fourteen (14) day period
beginning on the later of (i) the Confirmation Date and (ii) the date each
Party has received written confirmation from the other Party that it and its
Representatives have received the information required by _Section 3.1(d)_
(such period, as it may be extended in writing by the Parties, the "
_Adjustment Period_ "), the CAC Special Committee, on behalf of CAC, and the
CEC Special Committee, on behalf of CEC, shall negotiate in good faith and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to determine whether an adjustment to
the Exchange Ratio is necessary, appropriate

 



-14-  and advisable, and the amount of any such adjustment, in any case taking
into account all relevant facts and circumstances impacting the intrinsic
value of CEC and CAC as of such time, including: (A) any value of the CIE
Earn-Out; (B) any value of any additional contributions by CEC to the
Restructuring that are not reflected in the RSA; (C) any Tax costs to CEC
related to any deferred discharge of indebtedness income under Section 108(i)
of the Code that cannot be currently fully offset with net operating losses
and other tax attributes; and (D) any Tax costs to CEC or its Affiliates
related to the Restructuring, including any transactions in connection
with the formation of OpCo and PropCo, that cannot be currently fully offset
with net operating losses and other tax attributes. In addition to any facts
and circumstances impacting intrinsic value, the Exchange Ratio may be further
adjusted during the Adjustment Period as necessary, appropriate and advisable
to reflect any value properly allocable to CAC in respect of any CEC
contributions to the Restructuring that reflect consideration for the releases
for the benefit of the Released Parties described in _Section 6.3(e)(i)_
pursuant to a procedure to be mutually agreed by the CAC Special Committee, on
behalf of CAC, and the CEC Special Committee, on behalf of CEC, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Commencement Date. During the Adjustment
Period, CEC shall provide to CAC a list of all Tax costs it believes are
described in clauses (C) and (D) of this _Section 3.1(a)_ (the " _Initial Tax
Adjustment Schedule_ "), and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree
in writing to the Tax costs on the Initial Tax Adjustment Schedule, together
with any additional potential Tax costs identified by CAC, to be used for
purposes of adjusting the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_.
Only such Tax costs that have been so agreed in writing shall be included on
and deemed part of the " _Tax Adjustment Schedule_ ".

 

(b) _Adjustment Deadlock_. If the CAC Special Committee, on behalf of CAC, and
the CEC Special Committee, on behalf of CEC, are unable to agree to an
adjustment to the Exchange Ratio by the end of the Adjustment Period (an "
_Adjustment Deadlock_ "), then there shall be no adjustment to the Exchange
Ratio.

 

(c) _Termination Rights_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger may
be abandoned, within the five (5) Business Day period following the date on
which the Adjustment Period ends:

(i) By CEC, if (A) an Adjustment Deadlock occurs and the CEC Special
Committee, on behalf of CEC, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to terminate this Agreement would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of CECs
directors under applicable Law or (B) the CEC Special Committee has not
received, as of a date that is reasonably proximate to the date on which the
Adjustment Period ends, an opinion of Centerview Partners LLC or such other
independent, nationally recognized financial advisor as selected by the CEC
Special Committee to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in preparing such
opinion as set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial
point of view, to CEC.

 

(ii) By CAC, if (A) an Adjustment Deadlock occurs and the CAC Special
Committee, on behalf of CAC, determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to terminate this Agreement would be

 



-15-  reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of CACs
directors under applicable Law, or (B) the CAC Special Committee has not
received, as of a date that is reasonably proximate to the date on which the
Adjustment Period ends, an opinion of Moelis and Company LLC or such other
independent, nationally recognized financial advisor as selected by the CAC
Special Committee to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to CAC and the CAC
Public Stockholders.

(d)  _Information Rights_. Subject to _Section 5.6_, each Party shall, upon
request from the other Party, furnish the requesting Party and its
Representatives with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in order for
such Partys independent, nationally recognized financial advisor to render a
fairness opinion in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section
3.1_.

 

3.2 _Conversion or Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of CAC Common Stock:

(a) _CAC Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article III_,
each share of CAC Common Stock (whether or not subject to restriction) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into, and become exchangeable for, that number of shares of CEC Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio (in the aggregate for all such shares of CAC
Common Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. From and after the Effective
Time, shares of CAC Common Stock shall be no longer outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and holders of
certificates (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ") formerly representing shares of
CAC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of CAC, other
than rights to receive (without interest) (i) any then-unpaid dividend or
other distribution with respect to such CAC Common Stock having a record date
before the Effective Time and (ii) the consideration to which such holders are
entitled in accordance with this  _Article III_. After the Effective Time,
there will be no transfers of shares of CAC Common Stock on the stock transfer
books of CAC or the Surviving Entity, and shares of CAC Common Stock presented
to CEC or the Surviving Entity for any reason will be canceled and exchanged
in accordance with this _Article III_. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 3.2_ to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger, each share of CAC Common Stock beneficially owned by CEC (other than
shares held in a trust, fiduciary, or nominee capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) or held in CACs treasury will be canceled and retired
and will cease to exist, and no shares of CEC Common Stock will be issued in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If, at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, CEC changes (or the CEC Board
sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a
change in) the number or kind of shares of CEC Common Stock outstanding by way
of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, exchange, readjustment,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization, distribution of securities
convertible into CEC Common Stock or similar transaction, then the Merger
Consideration (and any other dependent items) will be adjusted
proportionately to account for

 



-16-  such change. If, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, CAC changes (or the CAC Board sets a related
record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the
number or kind of shares of CAC Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock
split, stock dividend, combination, exchange, readjustment, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization, distribution of securities convertible into
CAC Common Stock or similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and
any other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for
such change.

 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of CEC Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu
of issuance of any such fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable to
a holder of CAC Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
CEC Common Stock which such holder would otherwise receive), such fractional
shares shall be rounded up (if equal to or greater than one-half of a share)
or down (if less than one-half of a share) to the nearest whole number of
shares of CEC Common Stock.

(e) _Shares held in Trust_. Other than shares of CAC Common Stock (i) held
directly or indirectly by CAC, CEC or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
trust accounts, managed accounts or otherwise held in fiduciary capacity for
the benefit of third parties and (ii) held by CAC, CEC or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted, all
shares of CAC Common Stock held directly or indirectly by CEC, CAC or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All
shares of CEC Common Stock owned by CAC or any of its Subsidiaries, other
than shares held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts or
otherwise held in fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties, shall
become treasury stock of CEC.

(f) _CEC Common Stock_. Other than as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_, all
shares of CEC Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding.

3.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Beginning on or before the Closing Date
and continuing until the date that is 360 days after the Effective Time, CEC
shall make available on a timely basis or cause to be made available to an
exchange agent agreed upon by CEC and CAC (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") (i) cash
in an amount sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to _Section 3.3(d)_ and (ii) certificates, or at CECs option, evidence of
shares in book entry form, representing the shares of CEC Common Stock (" _New
Certificates_ "), each to be given to the holders of CAC Common Stock in
exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_. On the date
that is 360 days after the Effective Time, any such cash or New Certificates
remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any earnings
in respect thereof) shall be delivered to (or as directed by) CEC. Any holder
of Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged its Old Certificates
pursuant to this _Article III_ shall thereafter be entitled to look
exclusively to CEC, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled upon exchange of such Old
Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be liable to any
holder of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



-17- (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, the
Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each
person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
CAC Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates
to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such
person may be entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Old Certificate shall promptly be
provided in exchange therefor, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after due surrender, a New Certificate. No interest will accrue
or be paid with respect to any cash or other property to be delivered upon
surrender of any Old Certificates. Each of CEC and the Surviving Entity shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of CAC Common Stock such amounts as it may be required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by CEC, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holders of CAC Common Stock in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made by CEC, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and such amounts shall be
delivered by CEC, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, to the applicable taxing authority.

(c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any New Certificate
representing shares of CEC Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition of such issuance that the Old Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of CEC Common Stock in a name other than that
of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required
for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to CAC Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_. After
the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this  _Article III_,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to the shares of CEC Common Stock represented by
the New Certificate.

 



-18- (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by CEC or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as CEC or the Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Old Certificate, CEC or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the
consideration deliverable in respect of the shares formerly represented by
such Old Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

3.4 _Equity Compensation_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
and unexercised option to purchase shares of CAC Common Stock (each, a " _CAC
Stock Option_ ") will, at the Effective Time, cease to represent an option to
purchase CAC Common Stock and will be converted automatically into an option
to purchase a number of shares of CEC Common Stock (each, a " _Converted
Stock Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of (i) the number of shares of CAC Common Stock subject to such CAC
Stock Option and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price of such
CAC Stock Option _divided_ _by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio, and each unvested CAC
Stock Option granted pursuant to the Caesars Acquisition Company 2014
Performance Incentive Plan shall be amended to provide that it shall become
vested and exercisable (at target performance levels, if applicable) upon the
optionees termination of employment without "cause" (as defined in the
Caesars Acquisition Company 2014 Performance Incentive Plan) by the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or for Good Reason (as defined herein), in
either case within six (6) months following the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the CAC Board shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary to cause each CAC Stock Option to be
converted, assumed and amended, as applicable, in accordance with the
foregoing. Following the Effective Time, except for the amendment of the
unvested CAC Stock Options granted pursuant to the Caesars Acquisition Company
2014 Performance Incentive Plan, each Converted Stock Option will continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the CAC
Stock Plan for each CAC Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested CEC
Stock Option granted under to the Caesars Entertainment Corporation 2012
Performance Incentive Plan shall be amended to provide that it shall become
vested and exercisable (at target performance levels, if applicable) upon the
optionees termination of employment without "cause" (as defined in
the Caesars Entertainment Corporation 2012 Performance Incentive Plan) by the
Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or for Good Reason (as defined
herein), in either case within six (6) months following the Effective Time.

 

(b) _CAC Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
right of any kind to receive shares or share equivalents of CAC Common Stock
which has been granted under any CAC Stock Plan (other than any CAC Stock
Option) (a " _CAC Award_ ") will, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a
right to receive shares or share equivalents in CAC Common Stock, and will be
converted automatically into the right to receive shares (or share
equivalents, as the case may be) in CEC Common Stock (each, a " _CEC Award_
"), which, in the case of CAC Awards denominated in shares shall be in an
amount equal to the product (rounded

 



-19-  down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of CAC Common
Stock subject to such CAC Award and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and each unvested
CAC Award granted pursuant to the Caesars Acquisition Company 2014
Performance Incentive Plan shall be amended to provide that it shall become
vested and exercisable (at target performance levels, if applicable) upon the
awardees termination of employment without "cause" (as defined in the
Caesars Acquisition Company 2014 Performance Incentive Plan) by the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or for Good Reason (as defined herein), in
either case within six (6) months following the Effective Time. In the case
of CAC Awards denominated in cash, the number of shares of CEC Common Stock or
other securities, property or cash that may be delivered in settlement thereof
shall be determined pursuant to the terms of the particular CAC Stock Plan on
the relevant settlement date(s) for such awards. Prior to the Effective Time,
the CAC Board or the CEC Board, as applicable, shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to cause each CAC Award to
be converted, adjusted, assumed and amended, as applicable, in accordance
with the foregoing. Following the Effective Time, except for the amendment of
the unvested CAC Awards granted pursuant to the Caesars Acquisition Company
2014 Performance Incentive Plan, each CEC Award will continue to be governed
by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the CAC Stock Plan
for each CAC Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested right of any kind to
receive shares or share equivalents of CEC Common Stock granted under the
Caesars Entertainment Corporation 2012 Performance Incentive Plan (other than
any CEC Stock Option) shall be amended to provide that it shall become vested
and exercisable (at target performance levels, if applicable) upon the
awardees termination of employment without "cause" (as defined in the Caesars
Entertainment Corporation 2012 Performance Incentive Plan) by the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or for Good Reason (as defined herein), in
either case within six (6) months following the Effective Time.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each CAC Stock Option, whether or not
intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code), will be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Sections 424
and 409A of the Code.

3.5  _Dissenters  Rights_. No appraisal or dissenters rights shall be
available to holders of CAC Common Stock or holders of CEC Common Stock in

Agreement, or the conditions to any Partys obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-40- 5.7 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from
the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. New York City time
on the date which is forty-five (45) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement (the " _Go-Shop Period End Date_ "), CAC and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall have the right (acting under the
direction of the CAC Special Committee) to directly or indirectly (A)
initiate, solicit and encourage any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, any acquisition or purchase of 100%
of the issued and outstanding CAC Common Stock (a " _CAC Acquisition
Proposal_ ") from one or more Persons, including by way of contacting third
parties or public disclosure and by way of providing access to non-public
information regarding, and affording access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records and personnel of, CAC and its Subsidiaries, to any
Person (each, a " _Solicited Person_ ") pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to CAC than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall include, among other things, customary
employee non-solicitation and non-hire provisions (a copy of which
confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within one (1)
Business Day) provided for informational purposes only to CEC); provided, that
CAC shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) provide to
CEC all material and information delivered or made available to any
Solicited Person to the extent such material and information was not
previously furnished or made available to CEC; and (B) enter into, participate
in and maintain discussions or negotiations regarding, and take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to, a CAC Acquisition
Proposal. Within one (1) Business Day following the Go-Shop Period End Date,
CAC shall notify CEC in writing of the material terms and conditions of any
CAC Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments or modifications thereof)
received from any Excluded Party (as defined below) and the identity thereof.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.7_, on the Go-Shop
Period End Date, CAC shall (i) immediately cease any activities permitted by
_Section 5.7(a)_ and any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other
than CEC and any Excluded Party) that are ongoing as of the Go-Shop Period End
Date and that relate, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a CAC
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data
rooms relating to a possible CAC Acquisition Proposal and (iii) promptly
request each Person (other than CEC and any Excluded Party) that
has theretofore executed a standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement
in connection with such Persons consideration of a CAC Acquisition Proposal
to return (or if permitted by the applicable agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable agreement.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.7_, from and after the
date hereof, each Party agrees that it (i) will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries (other than, during the period from the Commencement Date to the
Confirmation Date, CEOC and its Subsidiaries) and its and its Subsidiaries
officers and directors (other than, during the period from the Commencement
Date to the Confirmation Date, the officers, members and directors of CEOC and
its Subsidiaries) not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents, advisors and other
Representatives (other than, during the period from the Commencement Date to
the Confirmation Date, the employees, agents, advisors 

 



-41-  and other Representatives of CEOC and its Subsidiaries) and affiliates not
to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage or participate in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
or have or participate in any discussions with, any Person relating to, or
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related to, any Acquisition Proposal for such Party (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "), (ii) will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any Persons other than the other Party with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Sections 5.7(b)_ and _5.7(c)_ , prior to the receipt of
the CEC Requisite Vote, the CEC Board, and prior to the receipt of the CAC
Requisite Vote at the CAC Stockholder Meeting, the CAC Board, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to this _Section 5.7(d)_,
(i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has
made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in
writing that the CEC Board or the CAC Board, as applicable, believes in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information
relating to the applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to such Party
than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall include, among other things,
customary employee non-solicitation and non-hire provisions (a copy of which
confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within one (1)
Business Day) provided for informational purposes only to the other Party)
and/or (iii) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
it to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), only if the CEC Board or the CAC
Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Each Party will promptly (within one (1) Business Day)
advise the other Party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep such other Party apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal as it may be amended, revised or
supplemented from time to time, and of the execution and delivery of any
confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal)
and will provide to such other Party all material and information delivered or
made available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal to the extent
such material and information was not previously furnished or made available
to such other Party, in each case on a current basis. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall notify the other Party, orally and in writing,
within one (1) Business Day if such Party enters into discussions or
negotiations with another Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal or
provides non-public information or data to any person in accordance with this
_Section 5.7_. Any non-public, competitively sensitive information provided
to any third party that is a competitor of CEC or CAC pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 5.7(d)_ or _Section 5.7(a)_ shall be provided
pursuant to reasonable and customary procedures designed to protect the
confidential and proprietary nature of such information.

 



-42- (e) For the avoidance of doubt, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the
receipt of the CAC Stockholder Approval at the CAC Stockholder Meeting, CAC
may continue to take any of the actions described in _Section 5.7(d)_
(subject to the limitations and obligations set forth herein) with respect to
any bona fide written proposals or offers regarding any CAC Acquisition
Proposal submitted by a Solicited Person on or before the Go-Shop Period End
Date if the CAC Board believes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal (each such Solicited Person, an "
_Excluded Party_ "); _provided_ , that an Excluded Party shall cease to be an
Excluded Party if the negotiations between CAC and such Solicited Person with
respect to the CAC Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Solicited Person
becoming an Excluded Party shall have been terminated.

 

(f) Except as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 5.7(g)_, (i) the CEC
Board shall not (A) withdraw, amend, modify or materially qualify, in a
manner adverse to CAC, the CEC Recommendation, (B) recommend a Superior
Proposal, (C) fail to recommend against acceptance of any third party tender
offer or exchange offer for the shares of CEC Stock within ten (10) Business
Days after the commencement of such offer, (D) make any public statement
inconsistent with the CEC Recommendation or (E) resolve or agree to take any
of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a " _CEC
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") and (ii) the CAC Board shall not (A)
withdraw, amend, modify or materially qualify, in a manner adverse to CEC, the
CAC Recommendation, (B) recommend a Superior Proposal, (C) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any third party tender offer or exchange
offer for the shares of CAC Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement of such offer, (D) make any public statement inconsistent
with the CAC Recommendation or (E) resolve or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a " _CAC Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ," and together with a CEC Adverse Recommendation Change, each an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(g) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.7(g)_, neither the CEC Board nor
the CAC Board shall make any Adverse Recommendation Change, or cause to
permit CEC or CAC, as applicable to enter into (or cause or permit any
Subsidiary of such Party to enter into) an Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of (i) the
CEC Requisite Vote (in the case of the CEC Board and CEC) or (ii) the CAC
Requisite Vote at the CAC Stockholder Meeting (in the case of the CAC Board
and CAC), the CEC Board or the CAC Board, as applicable shall be permitted
(x) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ to enter into a
definitive Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.7_, subject to
compliance with _Section 5.7(h)_ and payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.2_, if the applicable board of directors (A) has
received an Acquisition Proposal that, in the good faith determination of
such board of directors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having
complied with _Section 5.7(h)_, and (B) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Party, if the board of directors effecting such
Adverse Recommendation Change determines in good faith, after consultation
with its legal advisors, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 



-43- (h) Neither the CEC Board or the CAC Board shall be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted
under _Section 5.7(g)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal unless: (A) the
applicable Party promptly notifies the other Party, in writing, at least five
(5) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") before making a CEC Adverse
Recommendation Change or a CAC Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable,
or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) an Acquisition
Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that CEC or CAC, as applicable,
has received an Acquisition Proposal that the CEC Board or the CAC Board, as
applicable, intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the CEC Board or
the CAC Board, as applicable, intends to make a CEC Adverse Recommendation
Change or CAC Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable and/or CEC or CAC,
as applicable, intends to enter into an Acquisition Agreement; (B) the
applicable Party attaches to such notice the most current version of the
proposed Acquisition Agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt
basis) and the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal; (C)
the applicable Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with the
other Party in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, if the other Party, in its discretion,
proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that,
after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the
terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3)
Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the
applicable Party notifies the other Party of any such material revision (it
being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (D) the CEC
Board or the CAC Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any adjustments made by the other Party during the Notice Period
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(i) Any determination to be made or action to be taken by the CAC Board or
the CEC Board under this _Section 5.7_ (including a determination to take no
action) shall be made or taken only upon the recommendation of the CAC Special
Committee or the CEC Special Committee, as applicable. 

(j) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either Party or the
board of directors of either Party from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or other disclosure requirements under
applicable Law or the NASDAQ rules, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

5.8 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No Party will take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each Party will take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect. No Party will take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and
each Party will take all necessary steps within its control to make those
transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions.

 



-44- 5.9 _Exchange Listing and De-Listing_. CEC will use commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of CEC Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and shares reserved for issuance pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof to
be approved for quotation on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective
Time. Prior to the Closing Date, CAC will cooperate with CEC and use
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of the
NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Entity of the CAC Common Stock
from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the CAC Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time.

5.10 _Consents; Applications_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable; (ii) obtain any permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations from, and all declarations, filings and
registrations with, any Governmental Entity (including any Gaming Authority)
required in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger; and (iii) make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings, and thereafter make any other
submissions with respect to this Agreement, as required under any applicable
Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(a)_, the Parties and
their respective Subsidiaries, as necessary, shall, reasonably promptly
following the date hereof, prepare and cause to be filed all required initial
applications and documents in connection with obtaining and maintaining the
Gaming Approvals (including where appropriate indications of further
information to come by supplementary filing) required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. CEC and CAC agree to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such Gaming Approvals (including the
maintenance of any existing Gaming Approvals) and to promptly and in good
faith respond to, and to cause their respective officers, managers, directors,
members, stockholders and Affiliates to promptly and in good faith respond
to, all requests for information by any Gaming Authority in connection with
such applications and otherwise cooperate in good faith with each other and
such Gaming Authorities. Each Party will notify the other promptly of receipt
of material comments or material requests from any Gaming Authority that
relate to Gaming Approvals. CEC and CAC agree to promptly advise each other
upon receiving any communication from any Gaming Authority that causes such
Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Gaming
Approvals required from such Gaming Authority will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either Party in its
reasonable judgment be required to take any action, or to refrain from taking
any action, that would be reasonably likely to interfere with or be adverse or
damaging to such Partys ongoing relationship with any Gaming Authority. 

 



-45- (c) CEC and CAC will, upon request from the other Party, furnish the
requesting Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries with or to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.11  _Indemnification_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, CEC
will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement
promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days after any written request, of
expenses to, the present and former directors, officers and employees of CAC
and its Subsidiaries and anyone who becomes a director, officer or employee
of CAC or its Subsidiaries during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any claim, action (whether
threatened, pending or contemplated), suit, proceeding or investigation
(each, a " _Proceeding_ "), including any Proceeding relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts as
incurred, in connection with any Proceeding, whether arising before or after
the Effective Time and whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or actions or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification; (ii) honor any existing, Previously Disclosed
agreements relating to indemnity; and (iii) for six (6) years after the
Effective Time, maintain in effect provisions in the Surviving Entitys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such document of any successor
to the business of the Surviving Entity) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
their intended beneficiaries than the provisions set forth in CECs or CACs
Governing Documents.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, CAC shall, or, if CAC is unable to, CEC
shall, as of the Effective Time obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for the
present and former officers and directors of CAC or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Such "tail" insurance policy will contain
coverage, amounts, terms and conditions, no less advantageous to such officers
and directors than the coverage currently provided by CAC. If CAC (or CEC) for
any reason cannot obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, CEC shall obtain comparable insurance for such six-year period with
coverage, amounts, terms and conditions no less advantageous to such officers
and directors than the coverage currently provided by CAC.

 



-46- (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
5.11(a)_, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify CEC; _provided_ that
failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of CEC under _Section
5.11(a)_ except to the extent that CEC is actually prejudiced as a
consequence.

(d) If CEC or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
any other entity, then and in each case, CEC will cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of CEC will assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section 5.11_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

 

5.12 _Benefit Plans and Labor Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, CEC and
CAC and their respective Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain waivers from all of their respective Employees who will become
employees of the Surviving Entity following the Merger and who are parties to
all employment agreements, severance agreements, change in control
agreements, equity and incentive award agreements or similar agreements
containing "change in control" or similar provisions, which state that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including but not limited to the
execution of this Agreement, any stockholder approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the consummation of such transactions) do
not constitute a " _Change in Control_ " (or similar term) as defined in such
agreements. Prior to the Effective Time, CEC and CAC will each honor the
terms of all applicable Labor Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, CEC and CAC may each negotiate new Labor Agreements
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and may
amend or change Benefit Arrangements in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

5.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_. CEC and CAC will give prompt notice
to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events
and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in _Article VI_.

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parties will
each take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause
any disposition of shares of CAC Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of CAC Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



-47- 5.15 _Corporate Governance_.

the CEC Board shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full
board of directors of the Surviving Entity at the Effective Time to be a
number that is reasonably agreed between CEC and CAC prior to the Effective
Time, and the members of the initial board of directors of the Surviving
Entity as of the Effective Time will be composed of the number of directors
designated by CEC and the number of directors designated by CAC, as is
reasonably agreed between CEC and CAC prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Executive Officers_. At or before the Effective Time, the CEC Board shall
take all actions necessary to cause the persons reasonably agreed between CEC
and CAC prior to the Effective Time to be elected or appointed as of the
Effective Time to the offices of the Surviving Entity reasonably agreed
between CEC and CAC prior to the Effective Time.

 

5.16 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Tax Representation Letters_. Officers of CEC and CAC shall execute and
deliver to Reed Smith LLP, tax counsel to CEC, and Skadden, Arps, Slate,

time or times as may be reasonably requested by such law firms, including at
the time the Joint Information Statement/Prospectus is declared effective by
the SEC and at the Effective Time, in connection with such tax counsels
delivery of opinions pursuant to _Sections 6.2(c)_ and _6.3(c)_ of this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Continuity of Business Enterprise_. CEC will continue at least one
significant historic business line of CAC, or use at least a significant
portion of CACs historic business assets in a business, in each case within
the meaning of Section 1.368-(1)(d) of the Treasury Regulations, except that
CEC may transfer CACs historic business assets (i) to a corporation that is
a member of CECs "qualified group," within the meaning of Section
1.368-(1)(d)(4)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations, or (ii) to a partnership if
(A) one or more members of CECs "qualified group" have active and
substantial management functions with respect to CACs historic business or
members of CECs "qualified group" in the aggregate own an interest in the
partnership representing a significant interest in CACs historic business,
in each case within the meaning of Section 1.368-(1)(d)(4)(iii) of the
Treasury Regulations.

its reasonable best efforts to cause the Restructuring to be tax-free to CEC
and to its Affiliates for federal and state income tax purposes or to cause
any Tax that would have otherwise been incurred in connection therewith to be
eliminated by netting net operating loss carryforwards or other net operating
losses that would have been available after first offsetting any deferred
discharge of indebtedness income under Section 108(i) of the Code or any other
operating income.

 



-48- 5.17 _Restructuring_. CEC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
implementation of the Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the RSA
and shall consult with CAC in good faith regarding any matter or filing in the
bankruptcy cases commenced by the Debtors that CEC determines, in its
reasonable good faith discretion, could reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to CAC. CEC shall, as promptly as practicable, deliver to

(a) _CEC s Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of CEC in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of
such date) subject to the standard set forth in _Section 4.2_; and CAC shall
have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf of CEC
by a senior executive officer of CEC to that effect.

(b) _Performance of CEC s Obligations_. CEC shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or before the Effective Time; and CAC shall have received a
certificate, dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf of CEC by a senior
executive officer of CEC to that effect.

 



-50- (c) _Opinion of Tax Counsel_. CAC shall have received an opinion of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, tax counsel to CAC, dated the Closing Date
and based on facts, representations and assumptions set forth or described in
such opinion, to the effect that the Merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
such opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP will be entitled to
receive and rely upon the Tax Representation Letters.

 

(d) _Absence of Material Adverse Effect_. There shall not have occurred, since
the date of this Agreement, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CEC.

(e) _Confirmation Order_.

 

(i) The Confirmation Order shall include, among other things, a provision
stating that, to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law, the
Releasing Parties shall be deemed to have released the Released Parties from
any and all claims, obligations, suits, judgments, damages, rights, causes of
action and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising, at law, in equity or otherwise,
relating to or based upon any act or omission relating to the Debtors which
occurred prior to the effectiveness of the Restructuring, and furthermore that
the performance of the terms of the Plan in facilitating the Restructuring
shall be a full and complete settlement of any claims or causes of action,
whether known or unknown, that the Releasing Parties have or could have
against the Released Parties relating to the Releasing Parties; and

(ii) the Confirmation Order shall include, among other things, a provision
stating that, to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law, none of the
Exculpated Parties shall have or incur any liability for any claim, cause of
action, or other assertion of liability for any act taken or omitted in
connection with, or arising out of, the bankruptcy cases commenced by the
Debtors or the negotiation, formulation, preparation, administration,
consummation, and/or implementation of the Plan, or any contract, instrument,
document, or other agreement entered into in connection therewith including,
without limitation, this Agreement, through the effective date of the Plan,
other than claims or liabilities arising out of or relating to any act or
omission of an Exculpated Party that constitutes actual fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence, which provision shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to CAC.

(f) _Minimum Cash_. CEC and CERP shall, collectively, have an amount of cash
and cash equivalents equal to at least $578.4 million, less (i) the
outstanding principal balance of CIEs credit facility with CEC as of the
Closing Date and (ii) the amount of Taxes that were both (x) included in the
Tax Adjustment Schedule pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and (y) actually paid by
CEC or CERP between the time the Confirmation Order is entered and the
Effective Time.

 



-51- (g) _Tax Ruling and Opinions_. One of the two following options shall have
been satisfied: 

(i) _Tax-Free Spin-Off Transaction_. CEC shall have received (x) a copy of a
favorable IRS Private Letter Ruling addressed to CEOC and CEC addressing
certain issues associated with the restructuring of CEOC into OpCo and PropCo
under Section 355 of the Code, which ruling shall be reasonably satisfactory
to CAC and (y) a should-level tax opinion from counsel to CEC, based on
facts, representations and assumptions set forth or described in such opinion,
that the restructuring of CEOC into OpCo and PropCo and the transactions
entered into in connection therewith shall be tax-free for federal income tax
purposes to CEC and all of its Affiliates (except to the extent any resulting
Tax liability is included in the Tax Adjustment Schedule pursuant to _Section
3.1_), which opinion (a) shall address only issues not addressed favorably in
the ruling described in (x), (b) shall be reasonable, customary and market as
to its scope, and (c) shall be reasonably satisfactory to CAC; or

 

(ii) _UPREIT Partnership Transaction_. CEC shall have received a should-level
tax opinion from counsel to CEC or CEOC, based on facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or described in such opinion, that the formation of the
proposed partnership and real estate investment trust, and the other
transactions entered into in connection therewith shall be tax-free for
federal income tax purposes to CEC and to all of its Affiliates (except to the
extent any resulting Tax liability is included in the Tax Adjustment Schedule
pursuant to _Section 3.1_), which opinion (a) shall be reasonable, customary
and market as to its scope and (b) shall be reasonably satisfactory to CAC.

(h) _Tax Costs_. The Restructuring Tax Costs are less than $300 million. The
Restructuring Tax Costs shall be determined as follows:

(i) After the Confirmation Date, and at least sixty (60) days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time, CEC shall deliver to CAC, a detailed summary (the
" _Preliminary Restructuring Tax Costs Report_ ") identifying the transactions
related to the Restructuring that may result in CEC or its Affiliates
incurring Tax costs and its assessment (including the anticipated amount) of
the Tax costs to be incurred by CEC or its Affiliates related to such
transactions, determined after the offset of any then currently available net
operating losses or other applicable tax attributes and after reducing the Tax
costs by the amount of any Tax costs to CEC or its Affiliates that (A) was
included in the Tax Adjustment Schedule pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and (B)
has been determined to be tax-free under the ruling, if any, or opinion
referred to in _Section 6.3(g)(i) _or _Section 6.3(g)(ii)_, as applicable,
(the resulting Tax costs after such reductions, and as may be supplemented by
CAC under _Section 6.3(h)(iii)_, the " _Identified Tax Costs_ ").

 

(ii) If the Identified Tax Costs exceed $300 million, CEC may deliver to CAC a
should-level opinion, which opinion is (a) reasonable, customary and market
as to its scope and (b) reasonably acceptable to CAC as to the non-taxable
status of any Tax costs included in the Identified Tax Costs and the Tax costs
favorably covered by such opinion shall be deemed to no longer be Identified
Tax Costs and, thus, shall be deemed not to be Restructuring Tax Costs.

 



-52- (iii) If, following the delivery of the Preliminary Restructuring Tax
Costs Report and/or any opinions pursuant to _Section 6.3(h)(ii)_, CAC
identifies additional potential Tax costs or CAC disputes CECs assessment of
the Identified Tax Costs within thirty (30) days of such delivery, CEC and CAC
shall negotiate in good faith, for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) days,
to mutually agree to the identity, amount and the Tax treatment of each Tax
cost included by CEC and CAC among the Identified Tax Costs. If CEC and CAC
mutually agree that a Tax cost should not be included in the Identified Tax
Costs or if CAC fails to dispute CECs assessment within the thirty (30) day
period, it shall be deemed not to be a Restructuring Tax Cost. If CEC and CAC
mutually agree that a Tax cost should be included in the Identified Tax
Costs, it shall be deemed to be a Restructuring Tax Cost.

(iv) If, following the negotiations described in _Section 6.3(h)(iii)_, CEC
and CAC disagree on the amount of the Identified Tax Costs and CAC believes
the Identified Tax Costs exceed $300 million, the Parties shall refer the
matter to a mutually acceptable independent "Big Four" accounting firm or law
firm of recognized national standing, whose determination will be final and
binding upon the parties (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ "). CEC and CAC shall each
bear one-half of the cost of the Tax Arbitrator. The Tax Arbitrator shall
apply the treatment mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to _Section
6.3(h)(iii)_ to those Tax costs mutually agreed by the Parties and include
such mutually agreed Tax costs in his or her determination of Restructuring
Tax Costs, and shall evaluate the remaining Identified Tax Costs as follows:

a) If the Tax Arbitrator determines that any Tax cost is likely to be non-
taxable at a should-level, the Tax Arbitrator shall exclude such Tax cost from
its determination of Restructuring Tax Costs;

 

b) If the Tax Arbitrator determines that any Tax cost is likely to be non-
taxable at a more-likely-than-not-level, the Tax Arbitrator shall include 50%
of such Tax cost in its determination of Restructuring Tax Costs; and

c) If the Tax Arbitrator determines that any Tax cost is not likely to be
non-taxable at a more-likely-than-not-level, the Tax Arbitrator shall include
100% of such Tax cost in its determination of Restructuring Tax Costs.

 

In making its determination of the likelihood of any Tax cost to be non-
taxable in _Section 6.3(h)(iv)(a)_, _Sections 6.3(h)(iv)(b)_ and _Sections
6.3(h)(iv)(c)_ , the Tax Arbitrator shall apply his or her reasonable
professional judgment without regard

 



-53-  to the formalities applicable to the "should" or "more-likely-than-not"
standards for purposes of rendering a formal tax opinion. The Tax Arbitrator
shall deliver to the Parties its finding of the total Restructuring Tax Costs
within a number of days to be mutually agreed by the Parties, but in no event
longer than thirty (30) days from the date such matter is submitted to the Tax
Arbitrator, and make an independent determination of the reasonable amount of
such Tax cost.

_Section 7.1(b)_ or by CEC pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and (y) CAC (A)
receives or has received an Acquisition Proposal, after the date of this

-55-  announced and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this

Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive
agreement which is later consummated with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal
(regardless of when made), (ii) by CAC pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)(ii)_ or
(iii) by CEC pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_, then CAC shall pay to CEC (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) within two (2) Business Days
after such termination (in the case of either of the foregoing clauses (ii) or
(iii)) or such consummation (in the case of the foregoing clause (i)), a fee
in an amount equal to the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event this Agreement is terminated by CAC pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)(ii)_ in connection with a CAC Acquisition Proposal received by CAC on
or before the Go-Shop Period End Date, the "Termination Fee" shall mean a fee
in the amount of $18,000,000. If this Agreement is terminated by CEC pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_, then CAC shall pay to CEC (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred
by CEC in connection with this Agreement on or prior to the termination of
this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate
(provided that CEC shall provide reasonable documentation thereof) (the " _CEC
Expenses_ "). Any CEC Expenses previously paid by CAC to CEC pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall be credited towards the payment of any Termination Fee
that becomes payable by CAC hereunder.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) (x) by CAC or CEC pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)_ or by CAC pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and (y) CEC (A)
receives or has received an Acquisition Proposal, after the date of this
Agreement, which proposal has been publicly announced and has not been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement, and (B) within twelve
(12) months after the termination of this Agreement, consummates a
transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later
consummated with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when
made), (ii) by CEC pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)(i)_ or (iii) by CAC pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(e)_, then CEC shall pay to CAC (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) within two (2) Business Days after such
termination (in the case of any of the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii)) or
such consummation (in the case of the foregoing clause (i)), a fee in an
amount equal to the Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated by CAC
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, then CEC shall pay to CAC (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred
by CAC in connection with this Agreement on or prior to the termination of
this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate
(provided that CAC shall provide reasonable documentation thereof) (the " _CAC
Expenses_ "). Any CAC Expenses previously paid by CEC to CAC pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(c)_ shall be credited towards the payment of any Termination
Fee that becomes payable by CEC hereunder.

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the provisions of this
_Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and (ii) the Termination
Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the applicable Party in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the

 



-56-  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If a Party shall fail to
pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the other Party makes a claim against the
Party failing to pay that results in a judgment against such Party, such Party
shall pay to the other Party the reasonable costs and expenses (including its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
_Section 7.2_ at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_. Any interest payable hereunder shall
be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a
360-day year. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall either
Party be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

8.2 _Waiver; Amendment_. The conditions to each Partys obligation to

by such Party as a whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
No waiver will be effective unless it is in a writing signed by a
duly authorized officer of the waiving Party that makes express reference to
the provision or provisions subject to such waiver. Before the Effective Time,
the Parties may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed
and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective Parties, except
to the extent that any such amendment would violate applicable Law or require
the approval of the stockholders of CEC or CAC, unless such approval is
obtained. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
decision or determination shall be made, or action taken, by CEC with respect
to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the CEC Special
Committee. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
decision or determination shall be made, or action taken, by CAC with respect
to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the CAC Special
Committee.

 

8.3 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either Party, in whole or in part
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent
of the other Party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

8.4  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by electronic or facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by
the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 



-57- 8.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement and any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and interpreted and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed and to be performed wholly within the State of Delaware and
without reference to the choice-of-law principles or rules of conflict
of laws that would result in, require or permit the application of the Laws
of a different jurisdiction or direct a matter to another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, solely if such courts
decline jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware)
(any such court, a " _Chosen Court_ ") any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in a Chosen Court. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
any defense of an inconvenient forum which such Party may now or hereafter
have to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Parties further
agree, (i) to the extent permitted by Law, that final and nonappealable
judgment against any of them in any action or proceeding contemplated above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or
outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment and (ii)
that service of process upon such Party in any such action or proceeding shall
be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 8.7_.

 

(c) EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY
LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED
UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION
8.5_. NO PARTY (OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE) HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR
REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 8.5_ WILL
NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

8.8 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and Disclosure Schedules) represents the
entire understanding of CEC and CAC regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersede any and all other oral or written agreements previously
made or purported to be made, other than the Confidentiality Agreement,
which will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. No
representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not
set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied on by any Party in
entering into this Agreement. Notwithstanding _Section 8.1_ or any other
provision hereof (other than _Section 5.11_, which is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties to the extent stated), nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any Person other than CEC and CAC and their respective
successors.

8.9  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



-60- 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is
in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at Law, in
equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this
_Section 8.10_ shall require any party hereto to institute any action or
proceeding for (or limit any Partys right to institute any action
or proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.10_ prior or
as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination).

-61- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their duly authorized officers as of the day and year first written above.
