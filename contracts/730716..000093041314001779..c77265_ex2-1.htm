ARTICLE I

  



  

 _THE MERGER_

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (in such capacity, the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Norton Rose Fulbright, 666 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10103 at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on the date that is two (2)
Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or
such other date, time or place as is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the parties hereto shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance with, and in
such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL with respect
to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become
effective upon the acceptance of the Certificate of Merger by the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company (which shall be provided by
Parent in writing no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time)) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub as of the
date hereof, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 5.8_ ).

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation and Parent_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the

Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) The individuals to be specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), any other securities of the Company or any shares of capital stock
or other securities of Merger Sub or, except as expressly set forth herein,
on the part of the Company or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock immediately prior to the Effective Time , and any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into,
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to _Section 2.4_
, an amount in cash equal to $19.25 without interest (collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_  shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist;
and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of Company
Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), and
the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger

   

-3- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to
be performed by the Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, the aggregate Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent no
later than the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration so deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to the holders immediately
prior to the Effective Time of Company Common Stock, be invested by the
Exchange Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, or (iii) money market funds that invest solely in
such obligations. Any interest and other income from such investments shall
become part of the funds held by the Exchange Agent for purposes of paying
the Merger Consideration, subject to _Section 2.2(e)_. No investment by the
Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required
by this _Article II_ and Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited
with the Exchange Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this
_Section 2.2(a)_. No investment by the Exchange Agent of the Merger
Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to promptly make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, any additional cash to pay the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this  _Article II_.

  



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal
(which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to
Closing) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof, without interest, for each share of

   

-4- 
--- 

  

--- 

     

Company Common Stock surrendered, and any Certificates and Book Entry Shares
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of such Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting
such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
such Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof as contemplated by this
_Article II_ , without interest and subject to any applicable withholding
Taxes.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
The applicable Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock and, at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of _Section 2.2(e)_ , if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

  



  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond and/or the providing by such Person of an indemnity,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this _Article II_.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds or other property (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this
_Article II_ , and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to
this _Article II_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment

    

-5- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Company
Common Stock held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case without any interest thereon and subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, payments
under _Section 2.3_ with respect to the cancellation of outstanding equity
compensation awards) such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall provide a notice to each holder (an " _Optionholder_ ")
of an outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted
(x) under a Company Stock Plan or (y) under the circumstances described on
_Section 2.3(a)_  of the Company Disclosure Schedule (an " _Option_ "),
pursuant to which all Options held by such Optionholder (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) may be exercised by such Optionholder for a period of
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time (but in no event later
than the date the Option would otherwise expire in accordance with its terms).
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any then outstanding Option that
previously has not expired or been exercised shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then still covered by the Option
_multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration _over_
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Option;
_provided_ that if the exercise price per share under any such Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Option shall be
canceled at the Effective Time without any payment or other consideration
being made in respect thereof.

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding restricted
stock unit award granted under a Company Stock Plan (" _Company Stock Unit
Award_ ") shall be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder thereof
to receive from the Company, in full and final settlement of such Company
Stock Unit Award, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration  _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are then still subject to such Company Stock Unit Award. If
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be earned under a
Company Stock Unit Award is subject to

   

-6- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

any performance conditions and if the Effective Time occurs prior to the end
of the stated performance period, then, for the purposes of this subsection,
the number of shares subject to such Company Stock Unit Award will be equal to
the number of shares that could have been earned at the applicable target
(100%) level of achievement.

  



  

(c) Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Surviving
Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the obligations under this
_Section 2.3_. All payments required under this _Section 2.3_ shall be made,
without interest, at or as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than
three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, and shall be subject to
applicable Tax withholding in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_ above.

  



  

(d) The parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of an
Option or a Company Stock Unit Award or any participant in any Company Stock
Plan shall have any right hereunder to acquire any shares of capital stock or
other equity interest (including stock appreciation rights, restricted share
units, performance shares, phantom units, deferred share units and dividend
equivalents) in the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the actions contemplated by
this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar
transaction or any transaction having the effect of any of the foregoing, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.4_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who
(a) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to and (b) complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead

Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code,
and (v) if applicable, each trust agreement and group annuity contract
relating to any material Company Plan. As used in this Agreement, " _Company
Plan_ " means any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, and each stock grant, stock
purchase, stock option, stock-based, severance, employment, change-in-
control, fringe benefit, loan, bonus, incentive, sabbatical, medical, dental,

Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, or to which the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates is a party, whether written or oral, for the benefit of any
present or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including their dependents or beneficiaries) or

have any material liability (contingent or otherwise).

  



  

(b) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates which has not been satisfied in full and no event
has occurred and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that
could reasonably be likely to result in the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the

no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination or opinion letter. Each Company Plan has been maintained in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and the
requirements prescribed by any applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code,
which are applicable to such Company Plan. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings against any Company Plan, any
fiduciary thereof, or the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any
Company Plan, except as does not have and would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any officer of the
Company or of any Subsidiary or any of the Company Plans which are subject to
ERISA, including the Company Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975

  

-17- 
---

of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could
subject the Company, any Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or of any
Subsidiary to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such
Section 4975 of the Code or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of
ERISA, in any such case, in an amount that would be material. All

individually or in the aggregate, be material to the financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Code) is in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the
Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder. Except as
otherwise disclosed in _Section 3.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
to provide any indemnity or gross-up payment to any individual with respect
to any income Tax, additional Tax, excise Tax or interest charge imposed
pursuant to Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code.

independent contractor of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment or benefits;
(ii) result in any payment or benefits becoming due, accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to
any such director, officer or employee; (iii) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation under any Company Plan or impose
any restrictions or limitations on the Company's rights to administer, amend
or terminate any Company Plan; or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that could
reasonably be expected, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

submission, announcement or implementation of, any proposal or offer (written
or oral) that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Takeover Proposal, (ii) initiate, knowingly encourage, participate in or
solicit any discussions or negotiations with any Person (whether such
discussions or negotiations are initiated by the Company, any of its
Representatives or a third party), other than Parent or any of its
Representatives, regarding or in furtherance of such inquiries or relating to
a Takeover Proposal, (iii) provide any non-public information, documentation
or data of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, other than
Parent or any of its Representatives, relating to a Takeover Proposal, (iv)
otherwise cooperate with any effort or attempt to make, implement or accept
any Takeover Proposal, (v) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Company Charter Documents inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder,
the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver
that may have been heretofore granted to any Person other than Parent any of
its Affiliates under any such provisions), (vi) enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition

related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as
set forth in the provisions of _Section 5.3(c)_ ), or (vii) adopt or approve
any Takeover Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Takeover
Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action. The Company shall
immediately cease, and cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and their

Representatives, in each case, with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and
request and instruct to be returned or destroyed all non-public information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such

such Takeover Proposal, and (ii) any material modifications to the financial
or other material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, in each case
as promptly as practical (and in any event within 24 hours) of receipt
thereof by the Company or any of its Representatives. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing such information to Parent and, to the extent the
Company is permitted by this _Section 5.3_ to engage in discussions or
negotiations relating to any Takeover Proposal, shall otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of any such discussions
or negotiations.

  



  

(c) If at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a
written Takeover Proposal from a third party that the Company Board believes
in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Takeover Proposal did not result
directly or indirectly from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ and (iii) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
that not taking such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may (1) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal and (2) engage and participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not, and
will not permit its Subsidiaries to, and will not permit its Representatives
to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without first entering
or having entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person and (y) will concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such
other Person which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

  



  

(d) Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 5.3(d)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withhold, withdraw or
modify or qualify, or

   

-35- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval, determination of advisability, or
recommendation by such Company Board or committee thereof of this Agreement,
the Merger, and the other Transactions contemplated hereby, (B) make any
other public statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting by
or on behalf of such Company Board or committee thereof that would reasonably
be expected to have the same effect or (C) approve, determine to be advisable,
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or
recommend, to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement that is intended or could reasonably be expected to result
in, any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided the Company shall not
have breached in any material respect its obligations under this _Section 5.3_
, (i) in response to a Company Intervening Event or (ii) if the Company
receives a Takeover Proposal which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal (after taking into account all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent in
accordance with subparagraph (II) below of this _Section 5.3(d)_ ), then, in
each case, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that not taking such
action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Law, (1) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) only in the
case of clause (ii) of this _Section 5.3(d)_ , approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (2), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless at or concurrently with, and as a condition to,
such termination the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee in full and otherwise complies with the provisions of
_Section 7.3_ ; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board shall not
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause
(1), approve or recommend any Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) (A) if, in the case of clause (2), such
Superior Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this _Section 5.3_
 and (B) unless, in the case of clauses (1) and (2):

  



  

(I) the Company Board shall have first provided at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice (a " _Notice of Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") to Parent that it is prepared to take the
applicable action in response to a Company Intervening Event or a Superior
Proposal, as applicable, which notice shall describe such Company Intervening
Event or Superior Proposal, as applicable, in reasonable detail, and, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, be accompanied by the most current version of all
relevant written agreements or proposals relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Notice
of Company Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update to such
Notice of Company Adverse Recommendation Change and the determination to so
deliver such Notice of Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or update or
amend public disclosures with respect

   

-36- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

thereto, shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement); and

  



  

(II) Parent does not make, within such three (3) Business Day period, a
binding, written, irrevocable offer to modify the terms of this Agreement so
that such terms, as so modified, would, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel
and financial advisors), cause the Takeover Proposal previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that would
obviate the need to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in the event
of a Company Intervening Event, as applicable, in each case, taking into
consideration any risk of non-consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of each such proposal. The Company
agrees that, during the three (3) Business Day period prior to its effecting
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or taking another action permitted by
clause (2) above, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereunder such
that the Takeover Proposal in question would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or that would obviate the need to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in the event of a Company Intervening Event. Each
successive modification to the price or any other material term of any
Takeover Proposal shall constitute a new Takeover Proposal for purposes of
this _Section 5.3(d)_ and shall require a new Notice of Company Adverse
Recommendation Change under _Section 5.3(d)(I)_ above, if applicable.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a "stop,
look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal or
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company (other than a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which may be made only in accordance
with  _Section 5.3(d)_ ) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any Person of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_ or (iv) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the stockholders of the Company). No disclosures under this
_Section 5.3(e)_ shall be, in themselves, a breach of this _Section 5.3_ or a
basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VII if such
disclosure is required under applicable Law or required under the rules and
regulations of any applicable stock exchange; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal
together with an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

   

-37- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(f) In the event that the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, it shall promptly make a public announcement of such change and such
announcement and shall set forth the material reasons for such change.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.

  



  

(g) The Company agrees not to waive or fail to enforce any standstill
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to a potential or actual Takeover
Proposal, in each case unless the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to do so would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_
that the Company shall not enforce any provision of any such agreement that
would prohibit a third party from requesting such termination, amendment,
modification or waiver of any such agreement or provision thereof. Subject to
the foregoing, the Company agrees to enforce the provisions (other than the
standstill provisions) of any such agreements, to the extent the Company has
Knowledge of any breach or potential breach, including seeking to obtain
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the U.S. or any
state thereof having jurisdiction.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Intervening Event_ " shall mean,
with respect to the Company, any material development or change in
circumstances that is not related to a Takeover Proposal, to the extent such
material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement but prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
and was neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives as of the date of
this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which
were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) changes in the market
price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or the fact that the
Company meets or exceeds internal or published projections, forecasts or
revenue or earnings predictions for any period shall not constitute a Company
Intervening Event (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving
rise to or contributing to such change or fact may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Intervening Event) and (ii) the
results of the introduction of new or modified products or the results of
sales or marketing initiatives (including any increase in sales as a result
thereof whether to new or existing customers) are reasonably foreseeable and
shall not be considered a material development or change in circumstances.

  



  

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona_
fide inquiry, proposal, offer or other expression or indication of interest
from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any of its Affiliates
thereof) relating to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to the
purchase or other acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, of (i) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary
course of business) that collectively account for 20% or more of the Company's
consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof) or from which
20% or more of the Company's revenues, earnings, or cash flow on a

   

-38- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

consolidated basis are derived or (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, recapitalization, sale of shares of capital stock, joint
venture, liquidation, dissolution, tender offer, exchange or similar
transaction.

  



  

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal (with all references to "20%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal being treated as references to "50%" for these purposes)
from any third party, which proposal was not the result of a material breach
of this _Section 5.3_ , (i) that the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, (A) is on terms that
would, if consummated, be more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking into
account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement which
Parent has made in accordance with the first sentence of _Section 5.3(d)(II)_
in response to a Takeover Proposal or a Company Intervening Event) and (B) is
reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with its terms on a timely
basis, taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of such Takeover Proposal and this Agreement that the Company Board considers
relevant and (ii) for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof), is reasonably likely to be obtained.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as reasonably practicable,
(ii) make promptly any required submissions and filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iii) promptly furnish
information required in connection with such submissions and filing under
such Antitrust Laws, (iv) keep the other parties reasonably informed

waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement
of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or
proceeding under Antitrust Laws, and (D) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions and (v) make all necessary notices to and
obtain all actions or non-actions, approvals, consents,
waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event on or
prior to the End Date). For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the
Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as
practicable and in any event within ten (10)

   

-39- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Business Days of the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree to a
different date), (B) supply as soon as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, (C)
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,

from, any third parties or other Governmental Authorities in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, and
(D) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including
any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable, and (ii) each party agrees to
(A) supply as soon as practical any additional information and documentary
material that may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority and
(B) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other
actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ as necessary to obtain any
necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other
actions or non-actions from each Governmental Authority (including as
described in _Section 3.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) as soon
as practicable.

  



  

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority and permit the
others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith
any comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Authority (other than the initial submission
of the Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act), (ii) keep the others
reasonably informed on a timely basis of any developments, meetings or
discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions and (iii) not
independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the
Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or
discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of Parent and the Company
may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or
their equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing
the non-public information. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters
with any Governmental Authorities consistent with its obligations hereunder.

  



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the agreements of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.4_ , if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that,

   

-40- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to
agree to (nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries agree unless
Parent so directs them (and they shall, if Parent so directs, agree, so long
as such agreements are conditioned upon the Closing)), to (i) divest, license,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or allow a third party to utilize, any
portion of its or their respective businesses, assets or Contracts or (ii)
otherwise take any other action that may be required or requested by any
Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining the
consents, authorizations, orders or approvals contemplated by this _Section
5.4_ that would have an adverse impact, in any material respect, on the
business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
5.4_ shall limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination,
complied with its obligations under this Section 5.4.

  



  

(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and approve, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and
consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.5_ shall not apply to any release or public
statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement in connection with a Takeover Proposal, a Superior
Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken
pursuant thereto or (b) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the Transactions; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of any party hereto to make
internal announcements to their respective employees and other stockholders
that are not inconsistent in any material respects with the prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Company's properties, books, Contracts and records, and
the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning its
business and properties as Parent may reasonably request (other than any
publicly available

   

-41- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws); _provided_ that Parent and their respective Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company; and _ provided_
, _further_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access
or information to Parent if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment after consultation with outside counsel, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third-party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege,
or expose the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information. Following expiration or early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, the Company shall also arrange visits by
Representatives of Parent to such customers as shall be mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall
affect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. Until the
Effective Time, the information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ will
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
December 2, 2013, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall not, and Parent shall cause its Representatives not to, use such
information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

  



  

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that as of the date of this Agreement it
(i) has had an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company with the
management of the Company, (ii) has had access to the books and records,
facilities, contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its
Representatives have requested to review, (iii) has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers of the
Company and (iv) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company, its businesses and the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other party if any of the following occur after the date of
this Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing
from any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such third party is
or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority, the NYSE or Nasdaq (or any other securities market)
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii)
such party becoming aware of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event
that could materially prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_
shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the parties hereto or the remedies available to the
party hereunder receiving such notice or the conditions to such party's
obligations to consummate the Transactions, and no information delivered
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall update any section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions

   

-42- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby or
consummated hereunder) in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Plan (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation, by-laws, other organizational documents and
any indemnification agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement with
an Indemnitee, in each case to the fullest extent provided therein, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their
respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Proceeding.

  



  

(b) Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnitee' s conduct complies with an applicable standard under applicable
Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable organizational documents of
Subsidiaries of the Company, or applicable indemnification agreements, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnitees in the defense of any Proceeding and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested by an Indemnitee in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.8_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Proceeding,
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination provides for no
obligation or admission of wrongdoing on the part of any Indemnitee (other
than the payment of money, which payment shall be satisfied in full by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation) and includes an unconditional release of all
of the Indemnitees covered by the Proceeding from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding. Nothing in this _Section 5.8(c)_  shall relieve Parent or
the Surviving Corporation of its obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

  



  

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
in effect as of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or comparable coverage, with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time either through the Company's existing insurance
provider or another

   

-43- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

provider reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount; and _provided_ , _ further_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, at Parent's request (and at its expense),
the Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the Surviving
Corporation would be permitted to spend during the six-year period provided
for in this _Section 5.8(b)_ , that provides coverage no materially less
favorable than the coverage described above.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have in effect on the date of this
Agreement by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies unless (A) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_ ).

  



  

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party hereto shall keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed of, and cooperate with the other parties
hereto in connection with, any litigation or claim against any party hereto
and/or its directors, officers or employees relating to the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require any party
hereto to take any action if it may result in a waiver of any attorney/client
or any other similar privilege. In furtherance of and without in any way
limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall upon the terms and subject
to the conditions contained in this Agreement use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall not, and

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
person who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed immediately
following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), base salary, base
wages, commissions, annual cash incentive compensation opportunities, 401(k)
plan and other health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than what is provided or made available to, or otherwise in effect
with respect to, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In addition, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide or
shall cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee whose employment
terminates during the one (1) year period following the Effective Time with
severance benefits at levels and on terms no less favorable than such
Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the terms
of the Company's severance policies as set forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) such severance benefits shall be
determined taking into account the service crediting provisions set forth in
_Section 5.11(b)_.

  



  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA (or any severance or vacation plan that is not so defined) maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any retiree healthcare plans
or programs maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any equity
compensation arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any
Continuing Employees will participate following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporations to, recognize all service of
the Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be as if such service were with Parent, for vesting and eligibility
purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies under
any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii)
benefit accrual purposes, except for seniority for severance or vacation, if
applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employees may
be eligible to participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ _,_ that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not
recognized under a corresponding Company Plan (if any).

  



  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to Continuing Employees who
are employed by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions
or (actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations
under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that with respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions shall be waived
only to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the date Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parent's health or similar

   

-45- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

plans. With respect to Continuing Employees who are employed by Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any deductibles and co-payments paid by
Continuing Employees under any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' health
plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, if requested to do so by
Parent in writing not less than ten (10) Business Days before the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, terminate any and all Company Plans intended
to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k)
of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date
the Company becomes a member of the same "Controlled Group of Corporations"
(as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the 401(k) plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries to accept any distribution from the Company 401(k)
plan(s) as a rollover contribution and the transfer of any promissory note
representing an outstanding participant loan, if so directed by a Continuing
Employee. The Company shall provide Parent (and its counsel) (i) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any documents (whether
amendments, resolutions, communications or otherwise) necessary or advisable
to effectuate this _Section 5.11(d)_ , (ii) with rights of approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of any such
documents and (iii) satisfactory evidence that all necessary actions have
been taken.

  



  

(e) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.11_ , the Company
will not send written notices or other written communication materials to the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  



  

(f) On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide a list of all
employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who have experienced,
or will experience, an "employment loss" or "layoff" (as those terms are
defined in the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, or any
analogous state or local Law (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ ")) at any time
during the ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to,
at any time during the ninety (90) days before the Closing Date, without
complying with the notice requirements and other requirements of the WARN Act,
effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any
site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any

layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) at any site of employment of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

Board or the appropriate committee of the Company Board shall take all
reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions, to (i)
terminate the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) ensure that no offering
period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement, (iii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from altering their

-46- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in
the ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP) and (iv)
provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant
under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the
extent not used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the ESPP be refunded to such participant before or as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). The Company shall
provide Parent (and its counsel) (i) with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any documents (whether amendments, resolutions,
communications or otherwise) necessary or advisable to effectuate this
Section 5.11(h), (ii) with rights of approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of any such documents and (iii) satisfactory
evidence that all necessary actions have been taken.

  



  

(i) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other person shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision
of this _Section 5.11_ shall create such rights in any such Persons.
Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or
preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require Parent or any Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plans or
Parent Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or

Section 5.13 _No Control of Other Party 's Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries'
respective operations.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each
(a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the
Transactions and (b) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to the Transactions, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting and Deregistration_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Company Common Stock to be delisted from Nasdaq and

, together with interest on such unpaid amount from the date such payment was
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of

Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then
the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party
under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the
issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words " _include_ ", " _includes_ " or "
_including_ " are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words " _without limitation_ ". The words " _hereof_ ", " _herein_ "
and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar import when used in this Agreement
shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the word "or" is

and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation. All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the

statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as

Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter
in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the
scope of the Company's representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth
in this Agreement. All attachments to the Company Disclosure Schedule
are incorporated by reference into the Company Disclosure Schedule in which
