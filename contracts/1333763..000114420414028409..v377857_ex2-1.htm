(c) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the restrictions
set forth in _Section 6.1_ and the other provisions of this Agreement, the
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Sub's acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and
such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

  



  

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Unless extended as provided in
this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on the date (the "Initial Expiration
Date") that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement
of the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject, in each case, to
Parent's and the Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1,_ if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as
of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and has not been waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with
the terms hereof), then Acquisition Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer
and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration Date for one or more
periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each,
ending no later than the Outside Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any
subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, the Minimum
Tender Condition and conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at
the expiration date are the only Offer Conditions that have not
been satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms
hereof), (i) Acquisition Sub shall, if and as requested by the Company in
writing, extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the
Initial Expiration Date for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of
up to ten (10) Business Days each, ending no later than the Outside Date or
(ii) if the Company shall not have requested such an extension in writing,
Acquisition Sub may extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date
beyond the Initial Expiration Date for one or more periods, in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, ending no later than the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquisition Sub
shall, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or
its staff, any rule or regulation of the Nasdaq, or any applicable Law or
Order, in each case, applicable to the Offer;  _provided_ , for the avoidance
of doubt, that if Acquisition Sub elects to increase the Merger Consideration,
it shall be required to extend the Initial Expiration Date or such other
subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire for the minimum
period required under the securities Laws.

  



  

(e) _Acceptance for Payment and Payment_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment, and pay for,

pursuant to the Offer in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act but in any event no later than 9 a.m. New York time on the third
Business Day following the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may
be extended in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_ ). At or prior to such time,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid to the holder thereof, subject to reduction for any Taxes required by
Law to be withheld or deducted. The irrevocable acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing", and the

Initial Expiration Date, or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _Section 10.1_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ , Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub
to, (i) promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of such
termination) terminate the Offer and in any event shall not acquire

Acquisition Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and
provide additional information for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such Party determines that failure to include such information
would cause the Offer Documents to omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any
request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the

the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement

with any supplements or amendments thereto, and including all exhibits

(subject to _Section 6.3(a)_ ), and promptly thereafter shall mail the

Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub that may be required by applicable Laws
or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and provide additional information for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that such Party determines that failure to include such
information would cause the Schedule 14D-9 to omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein. The Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Schedule
14D-9, and shall provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall provide Parent and Acquisition
Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders
of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and
Acquisition Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response. The Company
hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and consents to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation (subject to _Section
6.3(a)_ ).

of Company Common Stock as of a recent date, together with copies of all
lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all
other information in the Company's possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Acquisition Sub such information (including updated lists of stockholders,
security position listings and computer files) and assistance as Parent or
Acquisition Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall not use or disclose the information contained in any
such labels, lists, listings and files other than in connection with the

then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

  



  

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(A) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company (or held in the Company's treasury), or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) except as provided in
_Section 3.7(c)_ , the Appraisal Shares) shall be automatically
converted, subject to _Section 3.7(b)_ , into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _ARTICLE III_.

  



  

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company (or held in the Company's treasury)
or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or consideration paid therefor.

  



  

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the
restrictions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and the other provisions of this
Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of _Section 2.1(c)_ , if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect thereof, and
such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

(c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ , but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to
reduction for any Taxes required by Law to be withheld or deducted. At the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to reduction for any Taxes required by Law to
be withheld or deducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, validly withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any of such
holder's Appraisal Shares or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the right of appraisal provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any of such holder's Appraisal
Shares, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ , without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(d) _Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall assume any
Company Options in connection with the Offer, Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Effective upon the Offer
Closing, each outstanding unvested, unexpired and unexercised Company Option
shall vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the
Effective Time, then upon the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be
cancelled. Each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable
thereafter, (i) an amount in cash, without interest and subject to
_Section 3.8(h)_ , equal to (A) the excess of (1) the Cash Consideration over
(2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) a CVR for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option; provided, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the amount payable shall be zero with respect to a Company Option
that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or exceeds the Cash
Consideration and such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated
without any payment being made in respect thereof (whether in the form of
cash or a CVR), and the holder of any such Company Option shall have no
further rights with respect thereto. CVRs in respect of Company Options shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to CVRs in respect of
Company Common Stock generally. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under the Company Stock
Plan and all Company Option agreements and any other plan or arrangement of
the Company, including delivering all required notices and making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof. The Company shall ensure, prior to the Effective Time, that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option (or former holder
of a Company Option) or any current or former participant in any Company
Stock Plan or Employee Plan shall have any right thereunder to (A) acquire any
capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries
or any other equity interest therein or (B) receive any other consideration in
respect of such Company Option.

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Cash Consideration in
accordance with this  _ARTICLE III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration as required to be paid or issued
pursuant to this Agreement (such deposit hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). For avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to
deposit any funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until
such deposit is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement. If any
holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, validly withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any of such holder's Appraisal Shares, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any of such
holder's Appraisal Shares, then Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration as
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Appraisal
Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall be deemed to include the cash so
deposited.

  



  

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of record of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Cash Consideration (subject to _Section 3.8(h)_ ) with respect
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of
the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.8(b)_ , each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE III_.

  



  

   

\- 19 -

--- 

    



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, it shall be cancelled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof
as provided in this _ARTICLE III_.

  



  

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to
the date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and any Taxes
resulting therefrom shall be paid by Parent. Nothing contained herein and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
promptly pay the Cash Consideration to all holders of Certificates, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration,
Company Option Amounts and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a
Company Option, as applicable, such amounts as Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of a Company Option, as the case
may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or
(ii) as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company on or after
January 2, 2012 and prior to the date hereof (other than in any "risk factor"

assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(to the extent either such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
publicly filed with the SEC or made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-Laws, as
amended to date. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of the

accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub
in _Section 5.7(a)_ , constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (x) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally, and (y) is subject to general
principles of equity ( _clause (x)_ and _(y)_ collectively, the

impact on the Company or its Subsidiaries, (i) each Company Option intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so
qualifies, (ii) each grant of a Company Option was made in accordance with
the terms of the Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other
applicable Laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of

granting, Company Options prior to, or otherwise coordinating the grant of
Company Options with, the release or other public announcement of material
information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their results of
operations or prospects. The Company has delivered or otherwise made
available to Parent copies of all equity plans covering the Company Options
and the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing such Company Options
and any award agreement evidencing any Company Option that contains material
terms that are inconsistent with, or in addition to, such forms (except with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby, the
grant date, the exercise price, the vesting schedule or the expiration date,
as applicable).

interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such Subsidiary's business as presently conducted. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.8_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are (A) no outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other Equity Interest or voting interest in,

(A), (B), (C)_ and _(D),_ together with the capital stock of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as "Subsidiary
Securities") and (v) no other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any

4.9 _Company SEC Reports_. Since January 2, 2012, the Company has filed on a
timely basis all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents with the
SEC that have been required to be filed by it under applicable Laws prior to
the date hereof. References herein to the term "Company SEC Reports" shall

not information furnished under) any Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or
Schedule 14A since January 2, 2012, including any exhibits and amendments
thereto. Since January 2, 2012, as of its filing date (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of
such amended or superseded filing), (a) each Company SEC Report complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, each as in effect
on the date such Company SEC Report was filed, and (b) each Company SEC
Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms,
reports, or other documents with the SEC. No executive officer of the Company
has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under Section
302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Report,
except as disclosed in certifications filed with the Company SEC Reports.
Neither the Company nor any of its executive officers has received notice from
any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy,
completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. The
Company and each of its officers, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
of its directors, is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations

thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with respect to any financial
statements filed on Form 10-Q), and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

  



  

(b) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term
is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that satisfy
the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective and reasonably designed to ensure that
all information required to be disclosed in the Company SEC Reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of
the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports.

  



  

(c) The Company maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability;
(iii) that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization; (iv) that the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and (v) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on the most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the
Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (1) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

obligation or other commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,

pursuant to _Section 10.1_  and the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize, direct or permit any of
their respective directors, officers or other employees, controlled
affiliates, or any investment banker, attorney or other authorized agent

unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to
request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this
_Section 6.2_. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiary or

Company; _provided_ , that, in the case of any violation by any
Representative that is not a director, officer or other employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, only a material violation thereby shall
be so deemed a breach.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take any of the following actions would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, prior to the Offer Closing, the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Company's Representatives and the
Company's Subsidiaries' Representatives may, upon providing Parent 24 hours'
prior written notice of its intent to take such actions (i) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person or group of Persons that
has made an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, either constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) grant a
waiver, amendment or release under any standstill agreement (or standstill
provision of any agreement) for the purpose of allowing any Person or group
of Persons to make an Acquisition Proposal and/or (iii) furnish to any Person
or group of Persons that has made an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal any non-public information relating to the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or afford to any such Person or group of Persons access to
the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case under this _clause (iii)_ pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided by
the Company to Parent within 24 hours of execution);  _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding _clauses (i)_
or _(iii)_ , the Acquisition Proposal in question shall not have resulted
from a breach of _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.2(b)_ or  _Section 6.2(d_ )
and (A) the Company gives Parent at least one (1) Business Day prior written
notice of the identity of such Person or group of Persons and the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal (and, if such Acquisition Proposal is in
written form, the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof), and (B)
contemporaneously with or prior to furnishing or making available any non-
public information or access to such Person or group of Persons, the Company
furnishes or makes available such non-public information or access to Parent
(which may be by posting such information to a "virtual data room" available
to Parent and its Representatives) to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished or made available to Parent.

  



  

(d) If the Company becomes aware of any receipt by the Company of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify Parent (and in no event later than
48 hours after receipt thereof) of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry
(and, if such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry is in written form,
the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material change in the status or terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including by providing copies of
additional written materials relating thereto within 48 hours of receipt
thereof).

  



  

6.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation (a "Company Board Recommendation Change");
_provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar
communication, shall not in and of itself be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Closing,
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if, (i) (x) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) receives an Acquisition Proposal not resulting from any breach of
_Section 6.2_ that it determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law or (y) an Intervening Event occurs and as a
result thereof the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Company Board Recommendation Change (a
"Recommendation Change Notice") (it being agreed that the Recommendation
Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the determination
to so deliver such notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement) and, if applicable, has provided Parent a summary
of any Superior Proposal and terms and conditions thereof (and a copy of any
definitive agreements related thereto); (iii) the Company shall have discussed
and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent's
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to make such Company Board
Recommendation Change would no longer reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties (and, if
applicable, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal)
during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery
by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending three
(3) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any Superior
Proposal shall require a new Recommendation Change Notice and a new three (3)
Business Day period); and (iv) no earlier than the end of the three Business
Day period following receipt of the Recommendation Change Notice, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law and, if applicable, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, after considering
the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, the
Acquisition Proposal that is subject of the Recommendation Change Notice
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and/or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ that any
Company Board Recommendation Change will be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

6.4 _Access_.

  



  

(a) At all reasonable times during the period commencing upon the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, afford Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal
counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable written notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to
a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information,
(iii) access to such documents or information would violate any obligation of
confidentiality by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or (iv) access
to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party
the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and
_provided_ _further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in
any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.4(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section 6.4(a)_ shall
be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of
damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the Company's properties shall be subject to the
Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall
not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal
counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with
any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.4(a)_.

  



  

(b) Unless prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall (i) keep Parent
promptly informed of any communication, correspondence, filing or response
(in each case whether written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMA and any other
comparable Governmental Authority and provide copies of all such written
communications, correspondences, filings or responses, (ii) provide Parent
with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and
consider in good faith the views and comments of Parent prior to
submitting or making, or otherwise taking any other action with respect to,
any communication, correspondence, filing or response to the FDA, EMA or any
other comparable Governmental Authority, (iii) give Parent reasonable advance
notice of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference with the FDA, EMA
or any other comparable Governmental Authority, (iv) consult with Parent in
advance of, and provide Parent an opportunity to participate in, each of such
meetings, and (v) promptly notify Parent of any data relating to the safety
or effectiveness of the Key Product not previously provided to Parent and keep
Parent promptly informed of, and consider Parent's views with respect to, the
status of the development and implementation of the launch of the Key Product.

  



  

6.5 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer (subject
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.6 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the Nasdaq to cause the delisting of the Company and
the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

ARTICLE VII 
  _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

  



  

7.1 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) any
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provision set forth in
any certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, for a period of six years from the Effective Time for
actions taken by any of the Indemnified Persons prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) all indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and set forth on _Section 7.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, for the duration of the applicable agreement (the
"Indemnified Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons
collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_ and
each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights hereunder as if
such person was a party to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.1(a)_ , during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Company would have been permitted to
do so under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
limitations on the Company's ability to indemnify its directors and officers
under Section 145 of the DGCL), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person
from and against any reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
(including, subject to the limitations on retaining counsel set forth in the
third sentence of this _Section 7.1(b),_ reasonable attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (in a settlement in respect
of which Parent has given its prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Person's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, or (ii) the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 7.1(b)_ , then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to advance, prior
to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly
following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses (including, subject to the limitations on
retaining counsel set forth in the third sentence of this _Section 7.1(b),_
reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry subject to receipt of an unsecured
undertaking to repay such amounts in the event that it is finally determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for advancement under this _Section 7.1(b)_
, then the right to advancement asserted in such notice shall survive the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (i) Parent shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, none of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, has waived any right to
object to the Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification hereunder
with respect thereto) , (ii) if Parent does not assume and control the defense
or if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent Parent and
the Indemnified Person, then such Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel, (iii) only if (x) Parent does not assume and
control the defense or (y) there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent Parent and the Indemnified Person, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any counsel retained by
an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor are received and
(iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected
without his or her prior express written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.1(b) _ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination (x) includes an unconditional
release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry that would not be indemnified by
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and (y) does not include any
statement as to admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnified Person.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) obtain and fully pay for "tail" prepaid insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance"),
for the Indemnified Persons, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the Company's existing
DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the
Company or Parent be required, and the Company shall not be permitted, to
expend for such policies pursuant to this _Section 7.1_  an annualized
premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance and, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Company may obtain a substantially
similar policy (from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Company's current insurance carrier) with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. If such "tail" prepaid insurance
policies have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time to, maintain such policies in full force
and effect, for their full term, and to continue to honor its respective
obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail" prepaid
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Persons, the
DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to
the Indemnified Persons as provided in the existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Company's current insurance carrier); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required, and the Company
shall not be permitted, to expend for such policies pursuant to this _Section
7.1_ an annualized premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance and, if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Company may, obtain a substantially
similar policy (from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Company's current insurance carrier) with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Each Indemnified Person is, and the
Indemnified Persons collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 7.1(c)_ , and each such Person shall have a right to enforce
the rights hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 7.1_. Each
Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons collectively are, intended
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1(d)_ , and each such Person
shall have a right to enforce the rights hereunder as if such person was a
party to this Agreement.

  



  

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (and, if and to the extent applicable, their heirs and
representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (and, if and to the extent applicable, their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons (and, if and to the extent
applicable, their heirs and representatives) is intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_ , with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and, if and to the
extent applicable, their heirs and representatives) under this _Section 7.1_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, by-laws or
other equivalent organizational documents of, or any and all indemnification
agreements of or entered into by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

  



  

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.1_ shall be
joint and several.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

7.2 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans and compensation arrangements, as
applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all legally binding
Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and unless otherwise
expressly terminated in accordance with their terms, such legally binding
compensation arrangements shall survive after the Effective Time, _provided_
that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating, or from causing Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans or
compensation arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2014, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than equity-based benefits,
individual employment agreements and any retention or other special or non-
recurring bonus or incentive awards) (such Employee Plans, the "Company
Plans") at benefit levels that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company
or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide
compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee under such Company
Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other
than equity-based benefits, individual employment agreements and any retention
or other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive awards) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other
than equity-based benefits, individual employment agreements and any
retention or other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive awards)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Comparable Plans"), or (iii) provide some combination of (i) and (ii) above
such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits, individual employment
agreements and any retention or other special or non-recurring bonus or
incentive awards) that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
equity-based benefits, individual employment agreements and any retention or
other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive awards) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the
period commencing on January 1, 2015 and ending on the first anniversary
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits, individual employment
agreements and any retention or other special or non-recurring bonus or
incentive awards) to each Continuing Employee that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity-based benefits, individual employment agreements
and any retention or other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive
awards) that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent ("Parent
Plans"). In each case, base salary or wages as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be decreased for a period of one year following the
Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period.

  



  

(d) To the extent that a Company Plan, Comparable Plan or Parent Plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where
length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however,_ that such service need not be
credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i) Parent shall cause to be waived or, where applicable, shall cause its
third-party insurance providers to waive, all eligibility waiting
periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any
pre-existing conditions limitations under such plans (such plans,
collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"), and only to the extent such waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing conditions limitations
were satisfied or did not apply to such Continuing Employee under the
corresponding Old Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the extent such waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence
of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements were satisfied
or did not apply to such Continuing Employee or his or her covered dependents
under the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan to the extent credited under the corresponding Old Plan and (iii)
credit the accounts of such Continuing Employee under any New Plan which is a
flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan to the extent such
Continuing Employee commences participation in such New Plan in the same
calendar year as the unused balance was credited to the applicable Company
Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to
such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time in accordance with the
practice and policies of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement, express or implied, shall be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee
for any reason, (ii) be an amendment to any Employee Plan or plan, program,
policy, agreement, arrangement or understanding of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) subject to applicable Law and subject to the limitations
and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section 7.2_ , require
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan,
Comparable Plan or Parent Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time. This _Section 7.2 _ shall be
binding and inure solely to the benefit of each Party to this Agreement, and
nothing in this _Section 7.2,_  express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or
former director, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this _Section 7.2_.

(including accounting and legal fees) associated with filing all Tax Returns
related to transfer Taxes incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated

may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange
or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant Party is subject
or submits, wherever situated, in which case the Party required to make the

(b) In the event that, during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending not less than five days prior to the Offer Closing,
Parent requests that the Company Compensation Committee consider whether any
plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Parent would like to enter into,
establish, amend or modify pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable,
or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or
future director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement, a "Post-Signing Arrangement"),
would constitute an Employment Compensation Arrangement and provides the
Company with such information with respect to such Post-Signing Arrangement as
the Company may reasonably request, the Company Compensation Committee will
promptly, and in any event prior to the Offer Closing, consider such Post-
Signing Arrangement at a meeting duly called and held. In the event that,
following such consideration, the Company Compensation Committee believes in
good faith that such Post-Signing Arrangement constitutes an Employment
Compensation Arrangement, at such meeting the Company Compensation Committee
shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement such Post-Signing Arrangement and (ii)
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such Post-Signing

8.9 _Directors_.

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter (as
long as Parent and its affiliates beneficially own a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock), Acquisition Sub shall be entitled
to designate such number of directors on the Company Board as will give
Acquisition Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act,
representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the
percentage that (A) such number of shares of Company Common Stock so accepted
for payment and paid for by Acquisition Sub plus the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of
such shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall, at
such time, cause Acquisition Sub's designees to be so elected; _provided,
however,_ that in the event that Acquisition Sub's designees are appointed or
elected to the Company Board, until the Effective Time the Company Board shall
have at least four directors who are members of the Company Board on the date
of this Agreement and independent directors for purposes of the continuing
listing requirements of Nasdaq, but who are not affiliates or employees of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Independent Directors"); provided
further that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below four for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent
Directors (or Independent Director, if there shall be only one remaining)
shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
four persons to fill such vacancies who are not, at the time of appointment,
officers, stockholders or affiliates of the Company, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take
all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election,
including mailing to holders of Company Common Stock the Information
Statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall
make such mailing with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely
basis all information required to be included in the Information Statement
with respect to Acquisition Sub's designees to the Company Board in accordance
with Section 2.2(a)). Parent and Acquisition Sub will be solely responsible
for any information with respect to them and their nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company shall promptly, at the option of Acquisition Sub, either increase the
size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its
current directors as is necessary to enable Acquisition Sub's designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above.

of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required for the Company
to authorize: (i) any termination of, or any agreement to terminate, this
Agreement by or on behalf of the Company, (ii) any exercise or waiver of
any of the Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) any
amendment to the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-laws
and other charter and organizational documents of the Company other than as
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger, (iv) any
extension of time for, or waiver by the Company of, the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub under this
Agreement, (v) any agreement between the Company and any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Acquisition Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand or (vi) any amendment,
waiver or modification of this Agreement that would, or would be reasonably
likely to, adversely affect the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock
under this Agreement.

\- 60 -

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

  



  

(b) by either the Company or Parent in the event that the Offer Closing shall
not have occurred on or before August 29, 2014 (such date referred to herein
as the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be
available to Parent if (A) Parent's or Acquisition Sub's actions or omissions
have been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the
Offer Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to
act constitutes a breach of this Agreement or (B) Parent or Acquisition Sub
is in material breach of this Agreement, and (ii) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to the
Company if (A) the Company's actions or omissions have been a principal cause
of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the Offer Closing to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach
of this Agreement or (B) the Company is in material breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(c) by either the Company or Parent if there shall be any Law enacted by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction after the date of this
Agreement remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
illegal or that prohibits the consummation of the Merger, or any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a permanent injunction prohibiting
the acceptance for payment of or payment for Company Common Stock
validly tendered pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and such injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; 
_provided, however,_ that in the case of an injunction a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(c)_ if
the issuance of any such injunction is primarily attributable to the failure
of such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) to perform in all material
respects any covenant or other obligation under this Agreement required to be
performed by such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) at or prior to the
Effective Time;

  



  

(d) by the Company, prior to the Offer Closing in the event that (i) the
Company shall have received a Superior Proposal not resulting from any breach
of _Section 6.2_ ; (ii) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing that
it intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice shall contain a
reasonably detailed description of all terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and attach a copy of all definitive agreements with respect to such
Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Superior Proposal Notice and any
amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such
notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement); (iii) if requested in writing by Parent, the Company shall have
made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith,
with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior
Proposal Notice and ending three (3) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time (it being understood and hereby agreed that (1) such three (3) Business
Day period may be the same three (3) Business Day period contemplated by
_Section 6.3(a)_ if the Superior Proposal Notice also serves as a
Recommendation Change Notice and (2) any amendment to any material term or
condition of the definitive agreements provided in the Superior
Proposal Notice shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new three
Business Day period); (iv) no earlier than the end of the three Business Day
period referred to in clause (iii), the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel), after considering the
terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_ would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law; (v) concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee payable to Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_ and (vi) the Company Board approves, and the

(e) by Parent, in the event that (i) Parent and Acquisition Sub have not
breached any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _clauses (ii)_ or _(iii)_ of

cure such breach within ten (10) Business Days after the Company has received
written notice of such breach from Parent (it being understood that Parent
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(e)_ in respect of the breach set forth in any such written notice (x) at
any time during such ten (10) Business Day period, and (y) at any time after
such ten (10) Business Day period if the Company shall have cured such breach
during such ten (10) Business Day period);

  



  

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, (ii) a
tender or exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a
Person unaffiliated with Parent and, within ten (10) Business Days after the
public announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that the Company
Stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of
Company Common Stock into such tender or exchange offer, (iii) the Company
Board fails to publically reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request by Parent to provide

Proposal that is publicly announced or otherwise publicly known, (iv) the
Company breaches clauses (iv) or (v) of the first sentence of _Section
6.2(b)_ or (v) the Company materially and intentionally breaches any other
provision of _Section 6.2_ ;

  



  

(g) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company has not breached any of
its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement in any
material respect and (ii) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached in any
material respect (A) any of its representations or warranties under this
Agreement or (B) covenants or obligations hereunder, and, in either case, such
breach would or would reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate with all other such breaches, prevent or materially impede, hinder
or delay the performance by Parent or Acquisition Sub of any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger and Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have failed to cure such
breach within ten (10) Business Days after Parent has received written notice
of such breach from the Company (it being understood that the Company shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(g)_ in respect of the breach set forth in any such written notice (A) at
any time during such ten (10) Business Day period, and (B) at any time after
such ten (10) Business Day period if Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have
cured such breach during such ten (10) Business Day period);

  



  

(h) by the Company, in the event that the Company has not breached any of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement in any material
respect and at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Acquisition Sub
fails to accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in
accordance with  _Section 2.1_ and at such time all of the conditions set
forth in _Annex A_ are satisfied and no subsequent expiration date for the
Offer is established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer; or

  



  

(i) by either the Company or Parent, in the event that as of the expiration
of the Offer in accordance with its terms (subject to any extension of the
Offer pursuant to this Agreement), all of the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms
hereof) except for the Minimum Tender Condition and conditions which by their
nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(i) _
shall not be available to a Party if (A) such Party's actions or omissions
have been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the
Minimum Tender Condition to be satisfied and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement or (B) such Party is in material
breach of this Agreement.

10.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_  shall be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating Party to
the other Party or Parties hereto, as applicable. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable (or any director, officer, employee,

_Section 6.4(a)_ , _Section 8.6_ , this _Section 10.2_ , _Section 10.3_ and
_ARTICLE XI_ , each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement,
and (b) subject to _Section 10.3(g)_ , nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any Party or Parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any
knowing and intentional breach of, or fraud in connection with, this
Agreement.

  



  

10.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Sections 7.5_ and _8.2_ and this
Section _10.3_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
or Parties, as applicable, incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer
or the Merger is consummated.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Sections 10.1(b)_ , _10.1(e) _ or _10.1(i)_ , (ii)
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the time of the
termination of this Agreement a third party shall have publicly disclosed a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal or the making or existence of such
proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known (and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the time of the termination
of this Agreement) and (iii) at any time prior to the date that is fifteen
(15) months following the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
purposes of this clause (b) all references to "20%" in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "50%", then, in
any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent $18,550,000 (the "Termination
Fee"), less the amount of Parent Expenses previously reimbursed by the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.3(e)_ , by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent,
within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the entry into such
definitive agreement or the consummation of such transaction.

  



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(d)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

  



  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after written
demand by Parent.

  



  

   

\- 63 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated because of the failure to
satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Sections _10.1(b)_ , _10.1(e)_ or _10.1(i)_ , the Company shall reimburse
Parent promptly upon demand, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of such demand, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, all reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources,
hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) ("Parent Expenses") incurred
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse Parent for
Parent Expenses in excess of $2,650,000. The reimbursement of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 10.3(e)_ shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay any applicable Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 10.3(b)_ (less the amount of Parent Expenses previously
reimbursed by the Company pursuant to this _Section 10.3(e)_ ).

  



  

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination
Fee or reimburse the Parent Expenses due pursuant to _Section 10.3_ , and, in
order to obtain such payment or reimbursement, as applicable, Parent commences
a Legal Proceeding that results in an award against the Company for such fee
or reimbursement, as applicable, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  



  

(g) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (x) if the Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
10.3_ , then any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
equity holders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors and none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, equity holders, managers, members,
Affiliates or successors shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (z) if Parent or Acquisition Sub receives any payments from
the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement or reimbursement of
Parent Expenses, and thereafter Parent is entitled to receive the Termination
Fee under _Section 10.3_ , the amount of such Termination Fee shall be reduced
by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent or
Acquisition Sub in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement and
reimbursement of any Parent Expenses.

  



  

10.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that after the Offer Closing and subject to _Section 3.7(b)_ ,
there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

  



  

10.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party or Parties hereto may, to the extent
legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Party or Parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party or Parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party or
Parties hereto contained herein (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Minimum Tender Condition unless such waiver is consented to in writing by the
Company). Any agreement on the part of a Party or Parties hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party or Parties, as applicable. Any delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

11.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties, and any assignment without such prior
written approval shall be null and void except that Parent and Acquisition
Sub may assign, in their sole discretion, any of or all their rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent but no such assignment shall relieve Parent
or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, of any of their obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall (i) be
binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the CVR Agreement (including the
Annexes and Exhibits hereto and thereto) constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
subject to _Section 8.6_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement
expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties
thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR
ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES,
ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR
AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE
AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR

such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to

and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

11.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that in any such case any breach of this Agreement could not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 10.1_ , each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with _Section 11.9_ , this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of
this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party hereto accordingly agrees not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such
Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section
11.7_. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall not be required to post a bond or undertaking in
connection with such order or injunction sought in accordance with the terms
of this _Section 11.7_.

  



  

11.8 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT
LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON,
RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

  



  

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction._

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware or Delaware Superior Court, for the
purpose of any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon, relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined exclusively

or prohibition of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in
effect, or any Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed
applicable by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and
remaining in effect, that, in any such case, prohibits or makes illegal the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (B) there shall be pending any
Legal Proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that has a substantial likelihood of success (1) seeking to make
illegal, restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (2) which, if
successful, would reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment;

  



  

(ii) (x) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 4.7_ ( _Capitalization_ ), _Section 4.8(b)_  ( _Subsidiaries_ ), and

(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of
such time, except where the failure of such representations and warranties to

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and except,
in each case, to the extent such representations and warranties are made as
of a specific date (in which case such representations and warranties shall
not be true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such specific
date only);

respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

On the date of the Offer Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer
or the chief financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the
conditions set forth in _clauses (c)(ii)_ , _(c)(iii)_ , and _(c)(iv)_ above

terms and conditions thereof.

  



  

The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum
Tender Condition unless such waiver is consented to in writing by the
Company). The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such rights
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.

  



  

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not defined in this _Annex
A_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of May 7, 2014, by and among H. Lundbeck A/S, Charlie Acquisition

of other branded prescription products commercialized by the applicable
Selling Entity, which shall be in accordance with United States generally

licensee or sublicensee. In the case of any sale for value other than
exclusively for money (but excluding any compassionate use, early access,
indigent patient and patient assistance or discount programs) on bona fide

consideration), Net Sales shall be calculated at the average Net Sales price
charged to third parties for cash sales of the Product in the jurisdiction of
sale during the relevant reporting period unless such sales in the
jurisdiction during the relevant period were only de minimis cash sales, in
which case at the fair market value as determined by comparable markets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following (including whether such amounts
actually exist or are deemed to exist for purposes of calculation) shall not
be included in Net Sales: (i) Product provided for administration to patients
enrolled in clinical trials or for other research purposes, (ii)
Product distributed through a not-for-profit organization or otherwise at no
or nominal charge to eligible patients in conjunction with any compassionate
use, early access, indigent patient or patient assistance program or (iii)
Product used for test marketing, promotional or sampling purposes.

  



  

" _Net Sales Statement_ " means a written statement of Parent, certified by
the Chief Financial Officer of Parent, setting forth Net Sales for the
applicable period and with reasonable detail (a) an itemized calculation of
the gross amounts invoiced by the Selling Entities for the Product sold to
third parties other than any other Selling Entity, (b) an itemized calculation
of the Permitted Deductions, and (c) to the extent that sales for the Product
are recorded in currencies other than United States dollars, the
exchange rates used for conversion of such foreign currency into United
States dollars. The Net Sales Statement shall be calculated in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and shall be
derived from the audited financial statements of Parent.

  



  

" _Officer 's Certificate_" means a certificate signed by the chief executive
officer, president, chief financial officer, any vice president, the
controller, the treasurer or the secretary, in each case of Parent, in his or

national accounts, long-term care organizations, insurers, Governmental
Entities and programs (including Medicare and the Veterans Health
Administration and other federal, state and local agencies), trade customers
or other organizations similar to the foregoing in line with approved contract
terms or other normal and customary understandings and arrangements
(including, as part of bundling or other forms of multi-product purchase
arrangements);

  



  

(5) tariffs, duties, excise, sales, value-added and other Taxes (other than
Taxes based on net income) and charges of Governmental Entities;

  



  

(6) transportation, freight, postage, importation, shipping insurance and
other handling expenses;

  



  

(7) distribution commissions and fees (including fees related to services
provided pursuant to distribution service agreements with
wholesalers, specialty pharmacy fees, fee-for-service wholesaler fees and
inventory management fees) payable to any third party providing
Distribution Services to the Selling Entities;

  



  

(8) costs of samples distributed by either specialty pharmacies or sales
representatives;

  



  

(9) deductions for uncollectible amounts on previously sold Products;

  



  

(10) discounts and provisions pursuant to compassionate use, early access,
indigent patient, co-pay reimbursement or assistance and patient
assistance or discount programs and coupon discounts;

by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, that
the applicable Selling Entity allocates to sales of the Product, as
applicable, in accordance with the applicable Selling Entity's standard
policies and procedures consistently applied across its products, as
applicable.

2. CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in

purpose of registering CVRs and transfers of CVRs as herein provided. The
CVRs shall, in the case of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _Section 2.2_
, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by
a written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly
executed by the Holder thereof, the Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, the Holder's personal representative or the Holder's survivor, and
setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to
the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall,
subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in
proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of _Section 2.2_ ),
register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register. Parent and Rights Agent
may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other Tax or
governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any such registration
of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any
action under any section of this Agreement that requires the payment by a
Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until the Rights
Agent is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid. All duly
transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid
obligations of Parent and shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits
and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to the
transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR shall be valid until
registered in the CVR Register.

  



  

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holder's address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the CVR
Register.

  



  

2.4. _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(a) On or before March 31 of each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, Parent shall
deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a notice (the " _Milestone Notice_ ")
indicating whether the applicable Sales Milestone was achieved with respect to
the previous year, (ii) if such Sales Milestone was achieved, cash equal to
the aggregate amount necessary to pay the applicable Milestone Payment to all
Holders pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , and (iii) the Net Sales Statement for the
year ended December 31 of the previous year along with any letter of
instruction required by the Rights Agent. Parent shall also deliver to the
Rights Agent on or before July 31st during 2015, 2016 and 2017, a Net Sales
Statement with respect to the first six months during such calendar year.

  



  

(b) The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of a Milestone Notice and/or a Net Sales Statement
as well as any letter of instruction required by the Rights Agent, send each
Holder at its registered address a copy of such Milestone Notice and/or Net
Sales Statement. If a Milestone Payment is payable to the Holders, then at the
time the Rights Agent sends a copy of the Milestone Notice to the Holders,
the Rights Agent shall also pay the applicable Milestone Payment to each of
the Holders (the amount which each Holder is entitled to receive shall be the
applicable Milestone Payment _multiplied_ _by_ the number of CVRs held by
such Holder as reflected on the CVR Register) (i) by check mailed to the
address of such Holder reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of
business on the date of the Milestone Notice or (ii) with respect to any such
Holder that is due an amount in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate who
have provided the Rights Agent wiring instructions in writing as of the close
of business on the date of the Milestone Notice, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified on such instructions.

  



  

(c) Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause the Rights Agent
to deduct or withhold, from any Milestone Payment otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or
any other applicable Tax Law, as may be determined by Parent or the Rights
Agent. Prior to making any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax
withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, Parent shall instruct the
Rights Agent to solicit IRS Form W-9s from Holders eligible for Tax
withholding within a reasonable amount of time in order to provide the
opportunity for the Holder to provide any necessary Tax forms (including an
IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such
withholding amounts. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid,
and prior to the 15th day of February in the year following any payment of
such Taxes by Parent or the Rights Agent, Parent shall deliver (or shall
cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid the original Form 1099 or other reasonably
acceptable evidence of such withholding.

(d) Any portion of any Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the
Holders nine months after the date of the Milestone Notice shall be
delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such Milestone Payment, without
interest, but such Holder shall have no greater rights against Parent than
those accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law.

  



  

(e) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Milestone Payment delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If, despite Parent's and/or the Rights Agent's
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver a Milestone Payment to the
applicable Holder, such Milestone Payment has not been paid prior to the date
on which such Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Milestone Payment shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of
any other indemnity obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Rights Agent with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or expense
Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in connection with transferring such
property to Parent.

  



  

(f) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the Holders and
the parties hereto agree to treat the CVRs received with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement for all U.S. federal
and applicable state and local income Tax purposes as additional consideration
paid at the Effective Time for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and none of the Holders and the parties hereto will take
any position to the contrary on any U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax Return or for other U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes except as required by applicable Law. The Company
shall report imputed interest on the CVRs pursuant to Section 483 of the
Code. The Holders and the parties hereto agree that the Milestone Payments
paid in respect of each CVR that was received with respect to Company Options
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, for all U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income Tax purposes, constitute wages in the year in which
the applicable Milestone Payment is made, and none of the Holders and the
parties hereto will take any position contrary on any U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax Return or for other U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes except as required by
applicable Law.

  



  

2.5. _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent_.

  



  

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent
or in any constituent company to the Merger or any of their
respective Affiliates.

direction, consent, order or other paper or document believed by it in good
faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties;

  



  

(b) whenever the Rights Agent shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action
hereunder, the Rights Agent may rely upon an Officer's Certificate, which
certificate shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent,
and the Rights Agent shall, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or
willful or intentional misconduct on its part, incur no liability and be held
harmless by Parent for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted
to be taken by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon
such certificate;

  



  

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and

premises;

  



  

(f) the Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of, and shall be

or recitals contained in this Agreement or be required to verify the same,
but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been
made by the Parent only;

  



  

(g) the Rights Agent shall have no liability and shall be held harmless by
Parent in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution

be responsible for any breach by the Parent of any covenant or condition
contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(h) Parent agrees to indemnify Rights Agent for, and hold Rights Agent
harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense
arising out of or in connection with Rights Agent's duties under this
Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
defending Rights Agent against any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss,
unless such loss has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to

intentional misconduct;

(in lieu of net income Taxes)). The Rights Agent shall also be entitled to
reimbursement from Parent for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket
expenses paid or incurred by it in connection with the administration by the
Rights Agent of its duties hereunder; and

  



  

(k) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend
or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its
rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

  



  

3.3. _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

  



  

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect,
which notice shall be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified
but in no event shall such resignation become effective until a successor
Rights Agent has been appointed. Parent has the right to remove Rights Agent
at any time by a Board Resolution specifying a date when such removal shall
take effect but no such removal shall become effective until a successor
Rights Agent has been appointed. Notice of such removal shall be given by
Parent to Rights Agent, which notice shall be sent at least 60 days prior to

appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to
the retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor Rights Agent,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent shall
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent

transfer agent (or other agent performing similar services for the Company),
the names and addresses of the Holders within 30 Business Days of the
Effective Time.

  



  

4.2. _Payment of Milestone Payments_. If a Sales Milestone has been achieved
in accordance with this Agreement, Parent shall, promptly (but in any event
no later than three Business Days) following the delivery of the Milestone

4.3. _Books and Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to enable the
Holders and their consultants or professional advisors to determine the
amounts payable hereunder.

  



  

4.4. _Audits_.

  



  

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders provided to Parent within
90 days following the date on which the Holders are delivered the year end
Net Sales Statement in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)_ of this Agreement (the " _Review Request Period_ "), Parent shall
permit, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to permit, the Independent
Accountant to have access during normal business hours to such of the records
of the Company or, to the extent available to Parent, other applicable
Selling Entity as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the
Net Sales Statement and the figures underlying the calculations set forth
therein, including all written materials related to any sale transaction
reasonably requested by such Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall be charged to
come to a final determination with respect to those specific items in the Net
Sales Statement that the Acting Holders and Parent disagree on and submit to
it for resolution, and the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Independent Accountant shall be limited to such specific items. All other
items in the Net Sales Statement that the Acting Holders and Parent do not
submit, prior to the end of the Review Request Period, to the Independent
Accountant for resolution shall be deemed to be agreed by the Acting
Holders and Parent and the Independent Accountant shall not be charged with
calculating or validating those agreed upon items. If issues are submitted to
the Independent Accountant for resolution, Parent shall, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to, furnish to the Independent Accountant such access,
work papers and other documents and information related to those disputed
issues as the Independent Accountant may request and as are available to
Parent. The Independent Accountant shall disclose to Parent and the Acting
Holders any matters directly related to their findings to the extent necessary
to verify the accuracy or completeness of the Net Sales Statements. The fees
charged by such accounting firm shall be paid by Parent.

  



  

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that there was a shortfall in the
amount of any Milestone Payment paid to the Holders, Parent shall
promptly pay to the Rights Agent (for further distribution to the Holders) or
to the Holders the amount of any such shortfall, plus interest on such amount
at the "prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal or similar
reputable data source from time to time calculated from when the applicable
Milestone Payment should have been paid, as applicable, to the date of actual
payment (such amount including interest being the " _CVR Shortfall_ "). The
CVR Shortfall shall be paid within ten Business Days of the date the
Independent Accountant delivers to Parent and the Acting Holders the
Independent Accountant's written report. The decision of the Independent
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders,
shall be non-appealable and shall not be subject to further review. The
decision of the Independent Accountant under this _Section 4.4_ shall
constitute an expert determination under the law governing expert
determination and not an arbitration.

(c) If, upon the expiration of the Review Request Period, the Acting Holders
have not requested a review of the Net Sales Statement in accordance with
this  _Section 4.4_ , the calculations set forth in the Net Sales Statement
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Holders, shall be non-
appealable and shall not be subject to further review.

  



  

(d) Each person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review pursuant to this _Section 4.4_ shall enter into, and shall cause its
accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with Parent or any controlled Affiliate obligating
such party to retain all such information disclosed to such party in
confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto agree that, if Parent or its Affiliates have exercised
audit rights under any license or distribution agreement prior to the
Acting Holders' request for an audit under this _Section 4.4_ and under such
license or distribution agreement Parent and its Affiliates cannot request
another audit, the results of Parent's prior audit of such licensee or
distributor shall be used for purposes of the audit requested by the Acting
Holders under this _Section 4.4_ and that Parent shall not have any
further obligation to provide access to an Independent Accountant with
respect to such licensee until such time as Parent may again exercise its
rights of audit under the license agreement with such licensee.

assignor) shall agree to remain liable for the performance by each Assignee
(and such other assignor, if applicable) of all obligations of Parent
hereunder, with such Assignee substituted for Parent under this Agreement.
This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by Parent's successors and each Assignee. Subject to
compliance with the requirements set forth in this _Section 6.3_ relating to
assignments, this Agreement shall not restrict Parent's, any Assignee's or any
of their respective successors' ability to merge or consolidate with, or
sell, issue, license or dispose of its stock or other equity interests or
assets to, any other Person, or spin-off or split-off. Each of Parent's
successors and assigns shall, by a supplemental contingent
consideration payment agreement or other acknowledgement executed and
delivered to the Rights Agent, expressly assume payment of amounts on all the
CVRs and the performance of every duty and covenant of this Agreement on the
part of Parent to be performed or observed.

6.4. _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Parent, Parent's
successors and assignees, and the Holders, each of whom is intended to be, and
is, a third party beneficiary hereunder) any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or
provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the Rights Agent, Parent, Parent's successors and
assignees, and the Holders. The Holders of CVRs shall have no rights except
the contractual rights as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Holder may at any time agree to renounce, in whole or in part, whether or not
for consideration, such Holder's rights under this Agreement by written notice
to the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if given, shall be irrevocable,
and Parent may, in its sole discretion, at any time offer consideration to
Holders in exchange for their agreement to irrevocably renounce their rights
hereunder.

  



  

6.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the CVRs and all actions arising under
or in connection therewith (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise)
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  



  

6.6. _Arbitration_. Any dispute, controversy or claim (including any claim
for breach hereof) based upon, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall be resolved by binding
arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration (" _Rules_
") of the International Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC_ "). The arbitration
will be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be
independent and a lawyer or retired judge with at least fifteen years
experience in the pharmaceutical industry or with mergers and acquisitions.
No later than fifteen days after an arbitration proceeding is commenced under
this _Section 6.6_ , Parent will nominate one arbitrator and the Holder (or,
if more than one Holder is a party to the arbitration proceeding, all such
Holders collectively) will nominate one arbitrator, and the two so nominated
arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators cannot
or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator within fifteen days of their
confirmation by the ICC, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC in
accordance with the Rules. The arbitration shall be administered by the ICC
acting through its International Court of Arbitration. The arbitration will be
conducted in the English language and the place of the arbitration will be
the city of New York, New York. Hearings will be conducted in New York, New
York, or at such other location as mutually agreed by Parent and the Holder or
Holders that are party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitration award
shall be final, conclusive, binding and non-appealable and shall not be
subject to further review by any court. The arbitrator shall have no power to
amend or supplement the terms of this Agreement or act ex aequo et bono.
Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Each party shall bear his, her or its own costs of any such
arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.6_ ,
any dispute, controversy or claim relating to the accuracy of the Net Sales
Statement or the determination of any Milestone Payment or CVR Shortfall shall
be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.4_ and not
subject to the arbitration provisions of this _Section 6.6_.

6.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties. The parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

6.8. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

6.9. _Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated and of no force or
effect, the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder (other than with
respect to monies due and owing by Parent to Rights Agent), and no payments
shall be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the mailing by
the Rights Agent to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR
Register the full amount of all potential Milestone Payments required to be
paid under the terms of this Agreement and (b) in the event the applicable
Milestone Notice indicates that the 2017 Sales Milestone has not been
achieved, the expiration of the applicable Review Request Period,
unless there has been a request for an audit pursuant to _Section 4.4_ prior
to the end of the Review Request Period, in which case until such audit has
been completed and any CVR Shortfall determined to be payable as a result of
such audit, if applicable, has been paid.

  



  

6.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement (including
the annexes and exhibits hereto and thereto) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. If and to the extent that any
provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern and be controlling.
