to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.</FONT></P>

Company Option shall vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then upon the Effective
Time, each Company Option shall be cancelled. Each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive,
at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, (i) an amount in cash, without interest and subject to <U>Section
3.8(h)</U>, equal to (A) the excess of (1) the Cash Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
and (ii) a CVR for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the amount payable shall be zero with respect to a Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or exceeds
the Cash Consideration and such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any payment being made in respect thereof
(whether in the form of cash or a CVR), and the holder of any such Company Option shall have no further rights with respect thereto.
CVRs in respect of Company Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to CVRs in respect of Company Common
Stock generally. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this <U>Section 3.7(d)</U> under the Company Stock Plan and all Company Option agreements
and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. The Company shall ensure, prior to the Effective Time, that following
the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option (or former holder of a Company Option) or any current or former participant
in any Company Stock Plan or Employee Plan shall have any right thereunder to (A) acquire any capital stock of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other equity interest therein or (B) receive any other consideration in respect
of such Company Option.</FONT></P>

means the gross amount invoiced by or on behalf of the relevant Selling Entity for the Product sold to third parties other than
any other Selling Entity, less the Permitted Deductions, all calculated on an accrual basis, as determined in accordance with the
applicable Selling Entity&rsquo;s usual and customary accounting methods consistent with the treatment of other branded prescription
products commercialized by the applicable Selling Entity, which shall be in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, as applicable, including the accounting methods for translating activity
denominated in foreign currencies into United States dollar amounts. In the case of any sale of the Product between or among the
Company, its Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, for resale, Net Sales shall be calculated as above only on the value charged
or invoiced on the first bona fide arm&rsquo;s-length sale thereafter to a third party. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case

is an end-user of, and does not further sell, the Product, Net Sales shall be calculated on the value charged or invoiced to such
Affiliate, licensee or sublicensee. In the case of any sale for value other than exclusively for money (but excluding any compassionate
use, early access, indigent patient and patient assistance or discount programs) on bona fide arm&rsquo;s-length terms (which has
the effect of reducing the invoiced amount below what it would have been in the absence of such non-monetary consideration), Net
Sales shall be calculated at the average Net Sales price charged to third parties for cash sales of the Product in the jurisdiction
of sale during the relevant reporting period unless such sales in the jurisdiction during the relevant period were only de minimis
cash sales, in which case at the fair market value as determined by comparable markets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following
(including whether such amounts actually exist or are deemed to exist for purposes of calculation) shall not be included in Net
Sales: (i) Product provided for administration to patients enrolled in clinical trials or for other research purposes, (ii) Product
