WHEREAS, Parent owns 100% of the outstanding equity interests in Seller;

  

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, Buyer desires

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  

ARTICLE 1 
  _PURCHASE AND SALE_

  

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Equity Interests_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, Buyer shall
purchase and acquire from Seller for the Aggregate Consideration, and Seller
shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, all of the Equity Interests,
free and clear of all Liens other than transfer restrictions arising under
federal and state securities laws and Liens created by, or otherwise arising
as a result of any action of, Buyer.

  

(b) In furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Equity Interests, at the
Closing:

    

   

    

(i)

  |  

Buyer will:

   
---|--- 
  

  

(A) make payment to Seller of an aggregate amount equal to the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration, as provided by Seller in accordance with
_Section 1.02(b)_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by Seller in writing prior to the Closing;

  

(B) deposit $1,395,000 (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow
Account_ ") established pursuant to the escrow agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") among Buyer, Seller, and the Escrow
Agent;

  

(C) deposit $1,070,000 (the " _Net Working Capital Escrow Amount_ ") by wire

and

  

(D) pay, on behalf of the Companies, the Indebtedness, as reported by Seller
in accordance with _Section _1.02(b), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated by the holders of such Indebtedness
in their respective Payoff Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Transaction Expenses described in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the
definition of such term shall be paid at the time provided in the Plan,
Benefit Program or Agreement, or other agreement or arrangement establishing
such Transaction Expenses.

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Seller will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer all of the Equity
Interests.

   
---|--- 
  

  

1.02 _Calculation of Estimated and Final Aggregate Closing Consideration_.

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Aggregate Closing Consideration_ "
means an amount equal to the result of: (i) $139,500,000 (the " _Purchase
Price_ "), _minus_ (ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, _minus_ (iii) the Net
Working Capital Escrow Amount, _minus_ (iv) the actual amount of Indebtedness
as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day prior to the Closing Date, _plus_ (v)
the amount, if any, by which actual Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m.
Eastern time on the day prior to the Closing Date exceeds the Net Working
Capital Surplus Threshold, or _minus_ (vi) the amount, if any, by which actual
Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day prior to the
Closing Date is less than the Net Working Capital Deficit Threshold, _minus_
(vii) $1,053,000, _minus_ (viii) $300,000, _plus_ (ix) the actual amount of
any Cash on Hand as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, when calculating the Aggregate Closing Consideration or the
Aggregate Consideration, any Transaction Expenses shall be included in the
outstanding amount of Indebtedness and not as current liabilities in Net
Working Capital.

  

(b) Five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller delivered to Buyer in
writing Seller's estimate of the Aggregate Closing Consideration, which
estimate Seller acknowledges was prepared by Seller in good faith based upon
the books and records of Seller and the Companies (such amount, the "
_Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration_ "), and shall include an estimate
of: (i) the total amount of each component item of Indebtedness (including
each component item of Transaction Expenses) and total Indebtedness as of
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day prior to the Closing Date (together with
the name of and wire transfer instructions for each payee thereof), (ii) the
amount of estimated Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the
day prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) the total estimated amount of Cash on
Hand as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day prior to the Closing Date.

  

 

2  

  

(c) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement setting forth Buyer's proposed calculation of the actual Aggregate
Closing Consideration with a comparison to the Estimated Aggregate Closing
Consideration, including Buyer's calculation of each of the components thereof
in sufficient detail to identify each item of difference between the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration and the Aggregate Closing Consideration,
including details regarding each component item of Indebtedness (the "
_Closing Statement_ ").

  

(d) Following receipt by Seller of Buyer's proposed Closing Statement and
until the Aggregate Closing Consideration is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.02_, Seller shall be permitted, upon reasonable advance
written notice and during normal business hours, to review the Companies'
books and records and working papers related to Buyer's draft of the proposed
Closing Statement and determination of the Aggregate Closing Consideration,
and Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable access to the Companies' senior
management and books and records, to the extent reasonably necessary for such
review. The proposed Closing Statement delivered by Buyer shall become final
and binding on the parties 30 days following Buyer's delivery thereof to
Seller unless Seller delivers written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Buyer on or prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
must identify with specificity each item in the proposed Closing Statement
that Seller disagrees with and, for each disputed item, contain a statement
describing in reasonable detail the basis of such objection and the amount in
dispute. If Seller delivers a timely Notice of Disagreement, then the Closing
Statement shall become final and binding on the parties to this Agreement on
the earlier of (i) the date Buyer and Seller resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in
writing by the Independent Accountants.

  

(e) During the 30 days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer
and Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Buyer and Seller shall submit
such dispute to the Independent Accountants for resolution of all matters
which remain in dispute which were included in the Notice of Disagreement (and
shall take all actions reasonably requested by the Independent Accountants in
connection with such resolution, including submitting written claims to the
Independent Accountants if so requested), and the Independent Accountants,
acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall make a final determination of
the Aggregate Closing Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (with it being understood that Buyer and Seller will request that
the Independent Accountants deliver to Buyer and Seller its resolution in
writing not more than 30 days after its engagement). The Independent
Accountants shall make a determination only with respect to the matters still
in dispute and, with respect to each such matter, their determination shall be
within the range of the dispute between Buyer and Seller. The Independent
Accountants' determination shall be based solely on written materials
submitted by Buyer and Seller (i.e., not on independent review) and on the
definitions of " _Aggregate Closing Consideration_ ," " _Indebtedness_ ," "
_Cash on Hand_ ," " _Net Working Capital_ ," and " _Transaction Expenses_ "
(and related definitions) included herein and the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

 

3  

  

(f) The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated
between Buyer and Seller based upon the percentage of the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to Buyer or Seller as compared to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if Seller claims the Aggregate
Closing Consideration is $1,000 greater than the amount claimed by Buyer, and
Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the
Independent Accountants ultimately resolve the dispute by awarding Seller $300

after the date on which the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is

of adjustment and no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included in whole
or in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in calculation

ARTICLE 4 
  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  

4.01 _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date
(as well as any Tax Returns for such periods reflecting Amendment Items) for
all Pre-Closing Periods (collectively, the " _Seller Prepared Returns_ ").
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past
practice of the Companies (and their Subsidiaries), except (i) as otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) upon approval of Buyer,
with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed,
with respect to the Amendment Items. At least 30 days prior to the date on
which each such Tax Return is to be filed, if such Tax Return relates to a
Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall submit such Tax Returns, together with all
supporting documentation and work papers, to Buyer for review and comment.
Seller will cause each such Tax Return to be timely filed and will provide a
copy to Buyer.

  

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date
for all Post-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods (collectively, the "
_Buyer Prepared Returns_ "). Such Tax Returns for the Straddle Periods shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Companies
(and their Subsidiaries), except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements. At least 30 days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return
is to be filed, if such Tax Return relates to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall
submit such Tax Returns, together will all supporting documentation and work
papers, to Seller for review and comment. Buyer will cause each such Tax
Return to be timely filed and will provide a copy to the Seller. With respect
to Tax Returns for the Straddle Period, Seller shall pay Buyer for the Taxes
paid with respect to such Tax Returns for the portion of the Straddle Period
which ends on and includes the Closing Date. Buyer shall request such payment
in writing, setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by the
Seller. Such payment by Seller shall be made no later than 10 days prior to
the due date for paying such Taxes without regard to the indemnification
limitations in _Article 5_.

  

(c) In completing any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the Transaction
Expenses and any other applicable expenses of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries associated with the Transaction shall, to the extent properly
deductible for federal income Tax purposes as determined by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion (following consultation with Seller), be separately
reported and allocated to a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. Except as required
by applicable Legal Requirements, to the extent that Buyer makes an allocation
of a pre-Closing expense or deduction that results in an expense or deduction
that could be properly deductible in a Pre-Closing Period return being
allocated or deducted in a post-closing federal Tax Return of the Companies,
and such allocation results in an increase in Tax liability of the Companies
or their Subsidiaries which, under this Agreement, results in a potential
claim by Buyer against the Indemnity Escrow Account shall not be a valid claim
against the Escrow Account.

  

 

37  

  

(i) The Buyer and Seller agree that to the extent the Disregarded Entities are
treated as "disregarded entities" (as described in Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-2(c)(2)) for federal Tax purposes, the purchase of the equity
interests of the Disregarded Entities shall be treated as a purchase of the
assets of the Disregarded Entities. The portion of the purchase price for the
equity interests of the Disregarded Entities (as determined for applicable Tax
purposes) to be allocated to the asset classes set forth on _Exhibit E_ shall
be allocated among the assets of the Disregarded Entities as set forth on
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall further
allocate the balance of the purchase price among the assets of the
Disregarded Entities in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Buyer and Seller agree to timely file IRS Form 8594,
Asset Acquisition Statement consistent with the allocation of the purchase
price as set forth on _Exhibit E_ attached hereto, and any similar form
required under state or local law in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements. For completeness, the assets of Buckler Distribution Center,
L.P. are also set forth on _Exhibit E_ attached hereto.

  

(ii) In the event that there is an adjustment to the purchase price, Seller
and the Buyer shall revise the allocation set forth on _Exhibit E_ to reflect
such adjustment.

  

(d) Except as otherwise required by applicable law (including in connection
with a voluntary disclosure), Buyer will not amend (or cause to be amended)
any Tax Return of the Companies, for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle
Period, or make (or cause to be made) any Tax election that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, in each case without the
prior written consent of Seller which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that such consent will
be deemed unreasonably withheld if such Tax Return is required by law to be
amended or if such Tax election is required by law to be made (including in
connection with a voluntary disclosure agreement) and in each case Seller is
held harmless by Buyer for all liability, cost, and expense related to such
amendment.

  

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.01(a)_ , Seller will not amend (or cause
to be amended) any Tax Return of the Companies without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent the Buyer may withhold at the Buyer's sole
discretion; provided, that Seller may amend Tax Returns of the Companies with
respect to the Amendment Items upon approval of Buyer, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

  

(f) Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding any Buyer Prepared Return and Seller Prepared Return prior to the
filing due date (including applicable extensions). In the event that Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Buyer Prepared
Return or Seller Prepared Return, such dispute shall be resolved by an
independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to both Buyer and Seller. The
fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Buyer
Prepared Return or Seller Prepared Return is not resolved prior to the
applicable filing due date (including applicable extensions), such Buyer
Prepared Return or Seller Prepared Return shall be filed in the manner that
Buyer, in its reasonable judgment, deems correct and consistent with this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Buyer Prepared Return or Seller
Prepared Return shall be amended to the extent necessary to reflect the
subsequent resolution of any such dispute by the independent accounting firm.

  

 

38  

  

(g) In the case of such Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of
the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Companies
and their Subsidiaries ended with (and included) the Closing Date; provided
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period; and

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of
such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

  

(h) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, the
filing of amended Tax Returns (including, without limitation, amended Tax
Returns), and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding (each a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,
operations or activities of the Companies and their Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, amended Tax Return, or Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer
agrees, upon request of the other, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other documentation from any Governmental Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed on Buyer, the Companies (and their Subsidiaries), or
Seller, including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (unless required by Legal
Requirements) Seller will not be required to take any action that would impose
or increase any obligation on the part of Seller, or create or increase any
claim against the Indemnity Escrow Account unless Buyer holds Seller harmless
from such action. The Companies (and Subsidiaries of the Companies) and Seller
shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Companies and their Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the
Companies or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding the above, the control
and conduct of any Tax Proceeding that is a third-party action shall be
governed by _Section 5.05_.

  

 

39  

  

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or other
similar Taxes imposed on the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or Seller
directly or indirectly as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and any penalties or interest
with respect to the Transfer Taxes will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller
and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the
foregoing, all costs related to the transfer or assignment of the Transferred
Equipment and Assets and Retained Real Property, including, without
limitation, any associated Transfer Taxes, will be borne one hundred percent
(100%) by Seller. The Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller will
cooperate in the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes,
including promptly supplying information in their possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

  

4.02 _Further Assurances_. From time to time from and after the Closing, as
and when reasonably requested by the other party, Seller and Parent, on the
one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as Buyer or Parent may reasonably deem necessary to evidence and
effectuate the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation thereof,
Parent shall provide to Buyer (i) delivery of certificates of title and other
indicia of ownership relating to the Transferred Equipment and Assets that may
be received from counterparties to the Payoff Letters or otherwise may be in
the possession of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent following Closing, (ii)
evidence of payment of Transfer Taxes (if any) relating to the transfer of the

partner, or manager of the Companies or their Subsidiaries (as applicable)
prior to the date hereof, with respect to a claim against any member of the
Seller Group by a third party that seeks to impose monetary liability by
virtue of an act or omission committed by such officer, director, member,
partner, or manager, in his or her capacity as an officer, director, member,
partner, or manager of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, (x) rights and

employee or officer of the Companies in the ordinary course of business
relating to the pay period in which the Closing occurs, or (z) rights and
claims arising from any member of the Seller Group's employment relationship
with the Company Group for any period beginning after the Closing.

  

 

40  

  

(b) THE RELEASE IN _SECTION 4.03(a)_ IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO OPERATE AND
BE APPLICABLE EVEN IF IT IS ALLEGED, CHARGED OR PROVEN THAT ALL OR SOME OF THE
CLAIMS OR DAMAGES RELEASED WERE SOLELY AND COMPLETELY CAUSED BY ANY ACTS OR
OMISSIONS, WHETHER NEGLIGENT, GROSSLY NEGLIGENT, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, OF
OR BY (AND WHETHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OF) THE
COMPANY GROUP.

  

(c) Seller represents and warrants that it has not transferred, pledged,
assigned or otherwise hypothecated to any other Person all or any portion of
Seller Released Claims (or any claims that would constitute Seller Released
Claims but for any such transfer, pledge or assignment) or any rights or
entitlements with respect thereto.

  

(d) Seller acknowledges that the provisions of _Section 4.03(a)_ are valid,
fair, adequate and reasonable and were agreed to with its full knowledge and
consent, were not procured through fraud, duress or mistake and have not had
the effect of misleading, misinforming or failing to inform Seller. Seller
further acknowledges that, in signing the release set forth in _Section
4.03(a)_, it has not relied on any promises or representations, express or
implied, that are not referred to herein.

  

(e) Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each member of the Seller
Group, hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, or assisting any party in the commencement of any action,
proceeding, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation or suit
(whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or informal) of any
kind against any member of the Company Group based upon any Seller Released
Claims purported to be released hereby. Seller understands that it is, on its
own behalf and on behalf of each member of the Seller Group, expressly waiving
all claims against the Company Group covered by the release set forth in
_Section 4.03(a)_, including those claims that he, she or it may not know of
or suspect to exist, that, if known, may have materially affected the decision
to provide the release set forth in _Section 4.03(a)_, and Seller is, on its
own behalf and on behalf of each member of the Seller Group, expressly waiving
any rights under applicable Legal Requirements that provide to the contrary.
Seller agrees that if it violates any provision of this _Section 4.03_, it
shall pay all costs and expenses of defending against any related or resulting
suit or other proceeding incurred by the applicable member of the Company
Group released hereunder, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

  

 

41  

  

4.04 _Restrictive Covenants_. In (i) consideration for Buyer's acquisition of
the Equity Interests and the transfer of the goodwill associated therewith,
(ii) order to protect the goodwill obtained by Buyer and transferred by Seller
as a result of the Transactions, and (iii) order to satisfy certain conditions
to the consummation of the Transactions and as a material inducement and
express incentive for Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller expressly
agrees to the provisions of this _Section 4.04_.

  

(a) _Covenant Not To Compete_. Seller and Parent covenant and agree that,
during the five-year period beginning on the Closing Date, Seller and Parent
shall not, and Seller and Parent shall cause any controlled Affiliates of
Seller or Parent not to, directly or indirectly, enter into any new Contract
to provide Dedicated Trucking Services or Flatbed Trucking Services (i) where
the customer's facility is an origin or pick-up location in the Restricted
Territory and/or a destination or delivery location in the Restricted
Territory, or (ii) for auto parts delivery directly to dealers and retailers
of auto manufacturers' locations anywhere in the United States.

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller, Parent, and their Affiliates
are in the business of providing trucking services, including Dedicated
Trucking Services and Flatbed Trucking Services, to many customers and will
continue to provide such services after the Closing Date and, for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4.04_ does not restrict Seller, Parent, or
their Affiliates from providing trucking services, including Dedicated
Trucking Services and Flatbed Trucking Services, except as specifically set
forth herein.

  

(c) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. During the five-year period beginning on
the Closing Date, Seller and Parent shall not, and Seller and Parent shall
cause any controlled Affiliates of Seller and Parent not to, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or
encourage to leave the employment or engagement of the Companies, Subsidiaries
of the Companies, or their Affiliates, or solicit, hire, engage or employ, or
cause any other Person to solicit, hire, engage or employ any employee
employed by the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, as of the Closing or
during such five-year period, unless such employee's retention or employment
had ceased for the preceding six months; provided that (x) general
advertising, including Internet postings and use of search firms, shall not be
deemed a breach hereof, nor shall hiring or retaining any Person who responds
to such a general advertisement and (y) nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Seller or any other Person from engaging any professional services
firm or other third party advisor or contractor that provides services to
multiple clients.

  

(d) _Limited Non-Solicitation of Material Customers_. During the five-year
period beginning on the Closing Date, Seller and Parent shall not, and Seller
and Parent shall cause any controlled Affiliates of Seller and Parent not to,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, cause,
solicit, induce or encourage the Material Customers to provide Committed
Trucking Services in the Restricted Territory.

  

(e) _No Interference with Suppliers_. Seller and Parent agree that, during the
five-year period beginning on the Closing Date, Seller and Parent shall not,
and shall not permit any controlled Affiliate of Seller, Parent, or any Person
acting at Seller's or Parent's direction or with Seller's or Parent's
encouragement to, directly or indirectly solicit, encourage, support, cause or
attempt to cause any Supplier to cease or lessen such Supplier's business with
the Companies, Subsidiaries of the Companies, or with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Supplier_ " means any
material supplier of goods or services to the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries as of the Closing or during such five-year period.

  

 

42  

  

(f) _Seller 's and Parent's Acknowledgements and Representations_. Seller and
Parent expressly acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth herein
are reasonable in all respects and are no greater than necessary to protect
Buyer's and its Affiliates' (including the Companies') legitimate business
interests, including the preservation of trade secrets, valuable confidential
and professional information, and the goodwill that Seller is conveying to
Buyer under this Agreement.

  

(g) _Reformation; Severability of Provisions_. The parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained herein are reasonable
and no greater than necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
its Affiliates. However, if any covenant set forth in this Agreement is
determined by any court to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too
great a period of time or over too great a geographic area, or by reason of
its being too extensive in any other respect, such covenant shall be reformed
and interpreted to extend only for the longest period of time and over the
greatest geographic area, and to otherwise have the broadest application as
shall be enforceable. The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular
provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement shall not affect the other
provisions hereof (or parts thereof), which shall continue in full force and
effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the covenants contained herein shall
be construed as separate covenants covering their respective subject matters.

  

(h) _Injunctive Relief_. Seller and Parent acknowledge that (a) the provisions
of this _Section 4.04_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Buyer, and (b) any violation of this _Section 4.04_ will result
in irreparable injury to Buyer, the exact amount of which will be difficult to
ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such violation would not be
reasonable or adequate compensation to Buyer for such a violation.
Accordingly, Seller and Parent agree that if Seller or Parent violates the
provisions of this _Section 4.04_, Buyer, in addition to all other remedies
which may be available to it at law or in equity, shall be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive relief, without posting bond or other
security, and without the necessity of proving actual damages. Such relief
will not be exclusive, but will be in addition to all other relief available
to Buyer and its Affiliates, at law and equity.

  

4.05 _Non-_ _Use of Certain Names_. Within 60 days following the Closing,
Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Companies and their
Subsidiaries after the Closing) to cease using the term "Celadon" and any
other word, expression or identifiers of source confusingly similar thereto or
constituting an abbreviation, derivation or extension thereof, including
removing, or causing to be removed, all such names, marks or logos from
wherever they may appear on the Companies' and their Subsidiaries' assets,
disposing of any unused stationery and literature of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries bearing the such marks. Immediately upon the Closing, Seller
shall and shall cause its Affiliates to cease using the terms "AandS," "Kinard,"
"Hunt Valley," and "Buckler," and any other word, expression or identifiers of
source confusingly similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation, derivation
or extension thereof, including removing, or causing to be removed, all such
names, marks or logos from wherever they may appear on the Companies' and
their Subsidiaries' assets, disposing of any unused stationery and literature

financial and operating records, invoices and other documents, records and
files) relating to any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries or any asset or
liability of the Companies or their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date in
the manner such books and records are maintained immediately prior to the
Closing Date. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies
and their Subsidiaries to, provide Parent, Seller and their Representatives

the books and records, and (c) reasonable cooperation and assistance, in each
case, relating to the assets, liabilities or business of any of the Companies
or their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, in
connection with the audit or restatement of Parent's historical financial
statements, and Parent, Seller and their Representatives will have the right
to make copies of such books and records and their sole expense. For purposes
of this _Section 4.07_ , " _Representatives_ " means, in respect of any
Person, such Person's Affiliates and such Person's and its Affiliates'
respective directors, officers, employees, and professional advisers,
including, without limitation, legal and financial advisors and accountants.

  

4.08 _Risk Retention Group_. Buyer acknowledges that the Companies and their
Subsidiaries have been provided insurance coverage by Transportation Insurance
Services Risk Retention Group, Inc., a South Carolina corporation ("TIS"), who
is an intended third party beneficiary of this _Section 4.08_. As of 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on March 28, 2019, the Companies and their Subsidiaries have
outstanding with TIS the claims, subject to the associated reserves, each as
set forth on _Schedule 4.08_. Buyer agrees that it will either (i) fund, pay
and/or settle directly any Losses associated with the claims set forth on
_Schedule 4.08_ and any other claims subject to insurance coverage provided by
TIS occurring on or prior to the Closing (collectively, the "TIS Claims"), up
to the applicable limits set forth on _Schedule 4.08_ , or (ii) fully and
timely fund (within two (2) Business Days of a written demand by TIS and prior
to the payment by TIS of the underlying Loss) the TIS Claims, up to the
applicable limits set forth on _Schedule 4.08_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, (a) Buyer agrees that, in the event any Losses associated with the
TIS Claims are not fully and timely funded as provided in the foregoing
sentence, Buyer will promptly reimburse TIS, or will cause TIS to be promptly
reimbursed, for any amount paid by TIS in respect of the TIS Claims and (b)
Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold TIS and Parent harmless from any
Losses, directly or indirectly, to the extent based upon, relating to,
incurred in connection with, resulting from, or with respect to the TIS
Claims, including, without limitation, any failure of the Buyer to fully and
timely fund any TIS Claim or reimburse TIS for any amount paid by TIS in
respect of the TIS Claims in accordance with this Section.

ARTICLE 5 
  _INDEMNIFICATION_

  

5.01 _Survival_. All of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article 2_ or _Article 3_ shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect until the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the representations set forth in _Section 2.01_
(Organization; Power and Authority), _Section 2.02_ (Enforceability), _Section
2.03(a)_ and _(b)_ (Authorization), _Section 2.04(a)_ and _(b)_ (Title;
Capitalization), _Section 2.05_ (Brokerage and Expenses), _Section 2.07_

Assets) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), and _Section
2.16_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 2.19_ (Environmental Matters)
(together, the " _Special Representations_ ") will remain operative and in
full force and effect until the later of (a) the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date and (b) expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus
60 days (each such date of expiration, as applicable, the " _Survival Date_
"). Subject to the foregoing, all representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations in this Agreement, and any other certificate or document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing for the applicable period
(if specified), or until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, if such shorter period is required by applicable Legal
Requirements). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
expiration of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in this
Agreement or any other certificate or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall affect the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee under this Article 5
or otherwise to seek recovery of Losses arising out of fraud.

  

5.02 _Indemnification_.

  

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
5_), Seller and Parent, jointly and severally, shall indemnify Buyer, the
Companies, Subsidiaries of the Companies, and each of Buyer's and the
Companies' respective Affiliates and representatives (all such foregoing
persons, collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), and defend and hold the
Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any Losses, directly or indirectly, whether or
not due to a third-party claim, incurred or sustained by or imposed upon a
Buyer Indemnitee, to the extent arising out of, based upon, relating to,
incurred in connection with, resulting from or with respect to or by reason of
any of the following:

  

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller
and Parent in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules, or contained in any
certificate delivered to Buyer pursuant to any provision of this Agreement;

  

 

45  

  

(ii) any breach of the covenants, obligations or agreements made by Seller and
Parent in this Agreement;

  

(iii) the Excluded Liabilities, Excluded Assets, and the Retained Real
Property;

  

(iv) any guaranty of any Indebtedness of any member of the Seller Group; and

  

(v) any matter listed on _Schedule 5.02(a)(v)_.

  

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 5.02(a)_ shall be subject to
each of the following principles or qualifications:

  

(i) All payments under this _Section 5.02_ shall be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the proceeds received by the indemnifying Seller and Parent
pursuant to _Article 1_;

  

(ii) Seller and Parent shall not have any liability with respect to the
indemnification obligations under _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ other than (A) the
possible loss of the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account and (B) an
additional amount equal to the aggregate actually recovered from the RandW
Policy (if any), except, in each case, in respect of (x) fraud, or (y) breach
of a Fundamental Representation or Special Representation;

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for
Losses arising from fraud, in no event shall Seller and Parent be liable for
aggregate Losses resulting from breaches or inaccuracies of any of the
Fundamental Representations in excess of the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration;

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller and Parent be liable for aggregate Losses resulting from breaches
or inaccuracies of any of the Special Representations in excess of
$50,000,000;

  

(v) With the exception of Losses arising from a breach of or inaccuracy in any
of the Fundamental Representations or fraud, no Losses shall be recoverable
pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which claims are made pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ exceeds one percent
(1%) of the Purchase Price, in which case the Buyer Indemnitees shall be
entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the
entire amount of such Losses (and not merely the portion of such Losses
exceeding such amount), provided, however, that in respect of any breach of
the representation made in Section 2.08(a) that the Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, no Loss shall count toward such 1%
threshold unless (i) such Loss shall be in excess of $100,000; or (ii) all
Losses in respect of such breaches shall exceed $500,000, in which case all
such Losses shall count toward such threshold;

  

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, or covenant in this Agreement or for purposes of
calculating any Losses with respect to a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, or covenant in this Agreement, if any such
representation, warranty or covenant is qualified by the use of the term
"Material Adverse Effect" or by the word "material" or by any word formed from
such words, then such representation or warranty shall be construed as if the
word "material" (and such words formed therefrom) or the term "Material
Adverse Effect" were not included in such representation, warranty or
covenant;

  

 

46  

  

(vii) Each Buyer Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the
extent required by applicable law, to mitigate all Losses of which Buyer has
knowledge for which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement; and

  

(viii) With respect to any claim for any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of Seller or Parent pursuant to _Section
5.02(a)(i)_ , except in respect of fraud, the Buyer Indemnitees shall first
pursue recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Account and under the RandW Policy, to
the extent coverage is available, prior to seeking recovery from Seller or
Parent. The amount of any Loss that is subject to indemnification under this
Article 5 shall be calculated net of the amount of any proceeds pursuant to a
third-party insurance policy or from any indemnity, contribution or similar
payment from a third-party, in each case to the extent actually received by
Buyer with respect to such Loss (net of all amounts that are self-insured and
the amount of any deductibles, co-payments, retro-premium obligations and
premium increases attributable thereto, and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
of collection of any such proceeds). If a Buyer Indemnitee receives such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being
indemnified under this _Article 5_ with respect to some or all of such Losses,
such Buyer Indemnitee shall pay to Seller the lesser of (A) the amount of such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment (net of all
amounts that are self-insured and the amount of any deductibles, co-payments,
retro-premium obligations and premium increases attributable thereto, and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collection of any such proceeds), and (B)
the aggregate amount paid by Seller to any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to
such Loss. Buyer shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts
(consistent with the efforts it would use to obtain insurance proceeds on its
own behalf) to obtain available insurance coverage with respect to any Losses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to file suit or
initiate litigation, mediation or any other proceeding with respect to such
insurance coverage. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no obligation
to seek recovery from any Person, other than insurance providers as discussed
in the previous sentence.

  

(ix) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, Buyer Indemnitees shall have no
right to recover under _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ or otherwise for any Loss relating
to any bodily injury, property damage, medical, or workers\' compensation
claim reserved on a Balance Sheet included in the Financial Statements.

  

5.03 _Escrow_.

  

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Account shall be available to compensate Buyer
Indemnitees for Losses pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth
in this _Article 5_.

  

 

47  

  

(b) In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on the next Business
Day following the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall pay and distribute out of the Indemnity Escrow Account (provided,
that the Escrow Agent has received joint written instructions from Buyer and
Seller), by wire transfer to Seller, an aggregate amount equal to the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (together with any interest that may be earned
thereon), less (x) any amounts which have been distributed from the Indemnity
Escrow Account prior to such date and (y) any amounts for which Buyer
Indemnitees shall have made a claim pursuant to the procedures set forth in
this _Article 5_ and for which recovery shall not have been satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Account (the " _Outstanding Escrow Claims_ ").

  

(i) As between the parties to this Agreement, if any term or provision of the
Escrow Agreement conflicts with any term or provision of this Agreement, then
the term or provision of this Agreement will control. Buyer and Seller will
each pay for 50% of the administrative fees of the Escrow Agent at the
Closing. All payments made from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to
_Article 1_ hereof.

  

(ii) In the event that Buyer is determined to be entitled to a recovery of a
Loss from the Escrow Account, Seller agrees to execute and deliver, at Buyer's
request, to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions within three Business
Days after the determination with respect to such Loss is made, instructing
the Escrow Agent to distribute to Buyer an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
the amount of such Loss and (B) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, in
accordance with such joint written instructions.

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Working Capital Escrow Account shall
_not_ be available to compensate Buyer Indemnitees for Losses pursuant to the
indemnification obligations set forth in this _Article 5_ and shall be
disbursed only as set forth in Section 1.02(h).

  

5.04 _Expiration of Claims_. The ability of Buyer Indemnitees to receive
indemnification under _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ shall terminate on the applicable
Survival Date, unless a Buyer Indemnitee shall have incurred or reasonably
expects to incur a Loss and makes either a written claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 5.02_ or a written claim for receipt of proceeds from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 5.03_, as applicable, on or
prior to the applicable Survival Date. If a Buyer Indemnitee has made either a
written claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.02_ or a written
claim for receipt of proceeds from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to
_Section 5.03_, as applicable, on or prior to the applicable Survival Date,
such claim, if then unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the passage of
the applicable Survival Date.

  

5.05 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnitee (such Buyer Indemnitee, the " _Claiming
Party_ ") to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement in respect of
a claim or demand made by any Person against the Claiming Party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Claiming Party shall promptly notify Seller and Parent
(the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing of the Third Party Claim after receipt
by such Claiming Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that
failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification obligations of Seller or Parent provided hereunder except to
the extent the Defending Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party shall
promptly deliver to the Defending Party after the Claiming Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all material notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Claiming Party from the Person making the Third Party Claim.

  

 

48  

  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof with recognized counsel selected by the
Defending Party and approved by the Claiming Party (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), so long as the requirements of
this _Section 5.05(b)_ remain true: (i) the Defending Party notifies the
Claiming Party within 15 days after the Claiming Party has given written
notice of a Third Party Claim to the Defending Party that the Defending Party
acknowledges that the Third Party Claim is a claim or demand which the
Defending Party must indemnify the Claiming Party against pursuant to this
_Article V_ and that the Defending Party is assuming the defense of such Third
Party Claim; and (ii) the Defending Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim in an active and diligent manner; _provided_ that the Defending
Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense (unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Claiming Party) if (x) the Third Party Claim relates to any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or (y)
the Third Party Claim seeks any relief other than monetary damages in an
amount not in excess of the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Account as to which no Outstanding Escrow Claims are pending or the insurer
under the RandW Policy has accepted defense. Should a Defending Party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall not be
liable to the Claiming Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Claiming Party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the
employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the
Defending Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim or
(ii) the Claiming Party's counsel shall have advised the Claiming Party in
writing, with a copy delivered to the Defending Party, that there is a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel. If the Defending
Party assumes such defense, the Claiming Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at the Defending
Party's expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Defending Party, it
being understood, however, that the Defending Party shall control such defense
(including any settlement with respect thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Defending Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Claiming
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement
of the validity of the Third Party Claim if such resolution would involve
anything other than the payment of monetary damages in an amount not in excess
of the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account as to which no
Outstanding Escrow Claims are pending or if such resolution does not include
an unconditional provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Claiming Party and all of its Affiliates and representatives from
all liability with respect thereto. If the Defending Party chooses to defend
any Third Party Claim, then all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim, including by retaining and
(upon the Defending Party's request) providing to the Defending Party all
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder; _provided_ , that such cooperation will not unduly disrupt the
operations of the business of such Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates or
cause such Claiming Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges,
breach any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise
cause any confidential information of such Claiming Party or any of its
Affiliates to become public to any greater extent than if the Claiming Party
or the RandW Insurer handled such defense (and the parties agree to enter into a
customary "common defense" or similar agreement if necessary). For the
avoidance of doubt, if Seller or Parent assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ as the Defending Party, all costs and
expenses incurred by Seller or Parent in connection with the defense of such
Third Party Claim shall be borne by Seller or Parent and shall not be
reimbursed from the Escrow Account. Whether or not Seller or Parent shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as the Defending Party, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of Seller or Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except with respect to any Third Party Claim (i) that
seeks the issuance of an injunction, the specific election of an obligation or
similar remedy, (ii) that seeks damages in excess of the amount then remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Account as to which no Outstanding Escrow Claims are
pending or (iii) the subject matter of which relates to the ongoing business
of the Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates, which Third Party Claim, if
decided against such Claiming Party, would materially affect the ongoing
business or reputation of such Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates, which
Third Party Claims the Claiming Party will be entitled to settle in its sole
discretion.

  

 

49  

  

(c) In any case in which a Buyer Indemnitee seeks indemnification under this
Agreement not arising out of a Third Party Claim, Buyer Indemnitee shall
notify Seller or Parent reasonably promptly in writing of any Losses that such
Buyer Indemnitee claims are subject to indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement. The notice shall describe the indemnification sought in reasonable
detail to the extent known, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if
necessary, and if then estimable) of the Loss that has been or may be
suffered. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5.02(b)_ and the
provisions of this _Section 5.05_, the failure of such Buyer Indemnitee to
exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such
claim unless and only to the extent that the resulting delay actually
materially and adversely prejudices the position of Seller or Parent with
respect to such claim.

  

5.06 _Determination of Loss Amount_. No Person shall be entitled to recover
damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity hereunder
more than once in respect of any one Loss or related group of Losses.

  

5.07 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

  

(a) If Seller or Parent raises bona fide good faith objections in writing to
any claim or claims by a Buyer Indemnitee made pursuant to _Section 5.05_
within 30 days of Seller's or Parent's receipt of notice of such claim, Buyer,
Seller and Parent shall attempt in good faith for 30 days after Buyer's
receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. If Buyer, Seller,
and Parent shall so agree and Buyer has elected to collect reimbursement for
such claim from the Escrow Account, joint written instructions setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute immediately
available funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
of such joint written instructions.

  

(b) If no such agreement can be reached during the 30 day period for good
faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 30 day period,
either Buyer or Seller/Parent may bring suit to resolve the matter in
accordance with _Section 7.12_.

  

 

50  

  

5.08 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in
this Agreement (including in Section 1.02 and Section 4.01), this Article 5
sets forth the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all rights,
claims and causes of action Buyer may have against Seller or Parent relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether arising under or based upon any law or otherwise (including
any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification,
contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy,
including as may arise under common law). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the liability of Seller or
Parent under this Article will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, (a)
any other liability that such Person may have at law or equity due to the
fraud of such Person; and (b) any equitable relief to which a Person may be
entitled relating to the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

7.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, but with it being understood that neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by
any party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may assign any or all of
its rights pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to one or more of its Affiliates, provided, that Buyer
will nonetheless remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder.

  

7.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Legal Requirements, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Legal Requirements, such provision
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement. Upon such a determination, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

7.06 _Construction and Disclosure_. Buyer and Seller each acknowledge and
agree that they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and
adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the parties
hereto, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Schedules is
not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Schedules in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule is or
is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules hereto
is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
Legal Requirements or breach of contract). Disclosure of an item on one
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure on another Schedule if it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that the disclosed contract, event,
fact, circumstance or other matter relates to the representations or
warranties covered by such other Schedule. Capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given
to them in this Agreement. Time is of the essence in the performance of each
of the parties' respective obligations contained herein.

  

 

65  

  

7.07 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and descriptions of the
Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of reference only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit,
characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no such
caption or description had been used in this Agreement.

  

7.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended only in a writing
executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Seller. Any provision of this
Agreement may be waived only in a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any
breach or default hereunder shall extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

  

7.09 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including the recitals to this
Agreement which are hereby incorporated by reference), the Escrow Agreement,
the Transaction Documents and any other agreements referred to herein or
therein and executed and delivered on or after the date hereof in connection
herewith or therewith, contain the complete agreement among the parties hereto
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
between such parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject
matter hereof in any way.

  

7.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

7.11 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

7.12 _JURISDICTION; VENUE; SERVICE OF PROCESS_. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
_SECTION_ _ 1.02_ (WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY SEEKING RELIEF UNDER OR PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY FEDERAL COURT (OR, IF SUCH FEDERAL COURT
DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, IN A STATE
COURT) IN DELAWARE. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF
AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH
COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR
INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN
RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE
VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR
SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT.

  

 

66  

  

7.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES
HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  

7.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Buyer Indemnities under
_Article 5_, no Person other than the parties hereto shall have any rights,
remedies, or benefits under any provision of this Agreement.

  

7.15 _Payments Under Agreement_. Each party agrees that all amounts required
to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate or
reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on the dates specified
herein.

  

7.16 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms hereof or thereof and deliver them
to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise (a) the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or (b)
the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

3  

  


 

  

(f) Buyer and Seller may each deliver written notice to Escrow Agent in

instructions, which notice will be effective only upon receipt by Escrow Agent
and after Escrow Agent has had reasonable time to act upon such notice.

  


 

  

5. _Suspension of Performance; Disbursement into Court_. If, at any time, (a) a dispute exists with respect to any obligation of Escrow Agent under this Agreement, (b) Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agent's reasonable satisfaction, Escrow Agent's proper actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or (c) the Representatives have not appointed a successor escrow agent to act under this Agreement in accordance with Section 9 hereof, then Escrow Agent may, in its reasonable, good faith discretion, take either or both of the following actions:

  


 

  

(i) suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including without
limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until such
dispute or uncertainty is resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Escrow

(ii) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, in any venue convenient to Escrow

liability or claimed liability that may arise due to any delay in any other
action required or requested of Escrow Agent, in each case if permitted by
this Section 5, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines, which determination is not subject to appeal, that Escrow Agent's
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct caused any loss to Buyer or
Seller.

  


 

  

6. _Resolutions and Disbursement of Claims_. If during the Escrow Period Buyer elects to make a claim for indemnity against Seller, then the procedure for administering and resolving such claims is as follows:

  


 

  

(a) If Buyer elects to assert a claim for indemnity as contemplated by the

expiration of the Escrow Period. Such Claim Notice must include a description
of the claim and the basis therefor and the amount, if known, asserted by
Buyer for such claim (including, if appropriate, an estimate of all costs and
expenses reasonably expected to be incurred by Buyer by reason of such claim).

  

 

4  

  


 

  

(b) Escrow Agent shall promptly pay an Indemnity Claim to Buyer from the
Indemnity Escrow Account following: (i) a Joint Written Direction or (ii) a
Final Order.

  


 

  

7. _Investment of Funds_. Based upon Buyer's and Seller's prior review of investment alternatives, in the absence of further specific written direction to the contrary at any time that an investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent is directed to invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in the investment identified in Schedule A. If applicable, Buyer and Seller acknowledge receipt from Escrow Agent of a current copy of the prospectus for the investment identified in Schedule A. Buyer and Seller may deliver to Escrow Agent a Joint Written Direction changing the investment of the Escrow Funds, upon which direction Escrow Agent may conclusively rely without inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that Buyer and Seller warrant that no investment or reinvestment direction will be given except in the following: (a) direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America; (b) U.S. dollar denominated deposit accounts and certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank and trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates), which are either (i) insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to FDIC limits, or (ii) with domestic commercial banks which have a rating on their short-term certificates of deposit on the date of purchase of at least "A-1" by SandP or "P-1" by Moody's (ratings on holding companies are not considered as the rating of the bank); or (c) money market funds, including funds managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates; provided further, however, that Escrow Agent will not be directed to invest in investments that Escrow Agent determines are not consistent with Escrow Agent's policies or practices. Buyer and Seller recognize and agree that Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of Escrow Funds or the purchase or disposition of any investment and the Escrow Agent will not have any liability for any loss in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent has no responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any investment and makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any such valuations. To the extent applicable regulations grant rights to receive brokerage confirmations for certain security transactions, Buyer and Seller waive receipt of such confirmations.

  


 

  

All investments will be made in the name of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may,
without notice to Buyer and Seller, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing
investments at any time for any disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted or
required hereunder and will not be liable for any loss, cost or penalty
resulting from any sale or liquidation of any such investment. All investment
earnings will become part of the Escrow Funds and investment losses will be
charged against the Escrow Funds. With respect to any Escrow Funds or
investment instruction received by Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m., U.S. Central
Time, Escrow Agent will not be required to invest applicable funds until the
next Business Day. Receipt of the Escrow Funds and investment and reinvestment
of the Escrow Funds will be confirmed by Escrow Agent by an account statement.
Failure to inform Escrow Agent in writing of any error or omission in any such
account statement within 90 days after receipt will conclusively be deemed
confirmation and approval by Buyer and Seller of such account statement.

  

 

5  

  


 

  

8. _Tax Reporting_. Escrow Agent has no responsibility for the tax consequences of this Agreement and Buyer and Seller shall consult with independent counsel concerning any and all tax matters. Buyer and Seller jointly and severally agree to (a) assume all obligations imposed now or hereafter by any applicable tax law or regulation with respect to payments or performance under this Agreement and (b) request and direct the Escrow Agent in writing with respect to withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges, and advise the Escrow Agent in writing with respect to any certifications and governmental reporting that may be required under any applicable laws or regulations. Except as otherwise agreed by Escrow Agent in writing, Escrow Agent has no tax reporting or withholding obligation except to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to Form 1099-B reporting on payments of gross proceeds under Internal Revenue Code Section 6045 and Form 1099 and Form 1042-S reporting with respect to investment income earned on the Escrow Funds, if any. To the extent that U.S. federal imputed interest regulations apply, Buyer and Seller shall, no later than 5 Business Days after the effective date of this Agreement, so inform the Escrow Agent, provide the Escrow Agent with all imputed interest calculations and direct the Escrow Agent to disburse imputed interest amounts as Buyer and Seller deem appropriate. The Escrow Agent will rely solely on such provided calculations and information and will have no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such calculations or information. Buyer and Seller shall provide Escrow Agent a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable, for each payee. If requested tax documentation is not so provided, Escrow Agent is authorized to withhold taxes as required by the United States Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. Buyer and Seller have determined that any interest or income on Escrow Funds will be reported on an accrual basis and deemed to be for the account of Seller.

  


 

  

9. _Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Buyer and Seller specifying a date when such resignation will take effect and, after the date of such resignation notice, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Escrow Agent's sole obligation will be to hold the Escrow Funds pending appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Similarly, Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by Buyer and Seller giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Escrow Agent specifying the date when such removal will take effect. If Buyer and Seller fail to jointly appoint a successor Escrow Agent prior to the effective date of such resignation or removal, Escrow Agent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent, and all costs and expenses related to such petition shall be paid jointly and severally by Buyer and Seller. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent's resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement will inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

  

 

6  

  


 

  

10. _Duties and Liability of Escrow Agent_.

  


 

  

(a) Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein and no duties will be implied. Escrow Agent has no fiduciary or
discretionary duties of any kind. Escrow Agent's permissive rights will not be
construed as duties. Escrow Agent has no liability under and no duty to
inquire as to the provisions of any document other than this Agreement,
including without limitation any other agreement between any or all of the
parties hereto or any other persons even though reference thereto may be made
herein and whether or not a copy of such document has been provided to Escrow
Agent. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility is to hold the Escrow Funds in
accordance with Escrow Agent's customary practices and disbursement thereof in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to make any calculations under this
Agreement, or to determine when any calculation required under the provisions
of this Agreement should be made, how it should be made or what it should be,
or to confirm or verify any such calculation. Escrow Agent will not be charged
with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set
forth herein. This Agreement will terminate upon the distribution of all the
Escrow Funds pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement, and
Escrow Agent will thereafter have no further obligation or liability
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or the Escrow Funds.

  


 

  

(b) Escrow Agent will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines, which determination is not subject to appeal, that Escrow Agent's
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its material
breach of this Agreement was the sole cause of any loss to Buyer or Seller.
Escrow Agent may retain and act hereunder through agents, and will not be
responsible for or have any liability with respect to the acts of any such
agent retained by Escrow Agent in good faith.

  


 

  

(c) Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other
instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which
Escrow Agent believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
the person or parties purporting to sign the same. In no event will Escrow
Agent be liable for (i) acting in accordance with or conclusively relying upon
any instruction, notice, demand, certificate or document believed by Escrow
Agent to have been created by or on behalf of Buyer or Seller, (ii)
incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages or penalties
of any kind (including, but not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such damages or penalty and regardless
of the form of action or (iii) any amount greater than the value of the Escrow
Funds as valued upon deposit with Escrow Agent.

  


 

  

(d) Escrow Agent will not be responsible for delays or failures in performance
resulting from acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war or terror,
epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line failures,
computer viruses, attacks or intrusions, power failures, earthquakes or any
other circumstance beyond its control. Escrow Agent will not be obligated to
take any legal action in connection with the Escrow Funds, this Agreement or
the Purchase Agreement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal
action or to take any other action that in Escrow Agent's reasonable judgment
may expose it to potential expense or liability. Buyer and Seller are aware
that under applicable state law, property which is presumed abandoned may
under certain circumstances escheat to the applicable state. Escrow Agent will
have no liability to Buyer or Seller, their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns, or any other party, should any or all
of the Escrow Funds escheat by operation of law.

  

 

7  

  


 

  

(e) Upon providing at least two Business Days' prior notice to Buyer and
Seller, Escrow Agent may consult, at Buyer's and Seller's expense (but only if
such expenses are reasonable and documented, and provided that, without
limiting the joint and several nature of their obligations to Escrow Agent,
Buyer and Seller agree between themselves that each will be responsible to the
other for 50% of Escrow Agent's expenses under this Section), legal counsel
selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction
of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties
hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving this Agreement, and will incur
no liability and must be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in
acting in accordance with the advice of such counsel. Buyer and Seller agree
to perform or procure the performance of all further acts and things, and
execute and deliver such further documents, as may be required by law or as
Escrow Agent may reasonably request in connection with its duties hereunder.
When any action is provided for herein to be done on or by a specified date
that falls on a day other than a Business Day, such action may be performed on
the following Business Day.

  


 

  

(f) If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished or
levied upon, or otherwise subject to any writ, order, decree or process of any
court, or in case disbursement of Escrow Funds is stayed or enjoined by any
court order, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its reasonable, good faith
discretion, to respond as it deems appropriate or to comply with all writs,
orders, decrees or process so entered or issued, including but not limited to
those which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon
it, whether with or without jurisdiction; and if Escrow Agent relies upon or
complies with any such writ, order, decree or process, it will not be liable
to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of
such compliance even if such order is reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

  


 

  

(g) Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of Escrow
Agent may buy, sell and deal in any of the securities of any other party
hereto and contract and lend money to any other party hereto and otherwise act
as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under this Agreement.
Nothing herein will preclude Escrow Agent from acting in any other capacity
for any other party hereto or for any other person or entity.

  


 

  

(h) In the event instructions, including funds transfer instructions, address
change or change in contact information are given to Escrow Agent (other than
in writing at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by
facsimile or otherwise, Escrow Agent is authorized, but not required, to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any person
designated by the instructing party on Schedule C hereto, and Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed
only in writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent and will be
effective only after Escrow Agent has a reasonable opportunity to act on such
changes. If Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the designated
representatives identified in Schedule C, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized
but will be under no duty to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to any one or more of Buyer's or Seller's executive
officers (" _Executive Officers_ "), as the case may be, which will include
the titles of Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice President, as Escrow
Agent may select. Such Executive Officer must deliver to Escrow Agent a fully
executed incumbency certificate, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. Buyer and Seller
agree that Escrow Agent may at its option record any telephone calls made
pursuant to this Section. Escrow Agent in any funds transfer may rely solely
upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Buyer or
Seller to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii)
an intermediary bank, even when its use may result in a transfer of funds to a
person other than the intended beneficiary or to a bank other than the
intended beneficiary's bank or intermediary bank. Buyer and Seller acknowledge
that these optional security procedures are commercially reasonable.

  

 

8  

  


 

  

11. _Indemnification of Escrow Agent_. Buyer and Seller, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee and affiliate of Escrow Agent (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") upon demand against any and all claims, actions and proceedings (whether asserted or commenced by Buyer, Seller or any other person or entity and whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses of any kind or nature (including without limitation reasonable and documented attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") arising from this Agreement or Escrow Agent's actions hereunder, except to the extent such Losses are finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which determination is not subject to appeal, to have been directly caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party in connection with Escrow Agent's actions under this Agreement. Buyer and Seller further agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party for all reasonable and documented costs, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Buyer's and Seller's obligations hereunder. Each Indemnified Party shall, in its reasonable, good faith discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it, and the reasonable and documented fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by Buyer and Seller jointly and severally. The obligations of Buyer and Seller under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

  


 

  

12. _Compensation of Escrow Agent_.

  


 

  

(a) _Fees and Expenses_. Buyer and Seller agree, jointly and severally, to
compensate Escrow Agent upon demand for its services hereunder in accordance
with Schedule B attached hereto. Without limiting the joint and several nature
of their obligations to Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller agree between
themselves that each will be responsible for 50% of Escrow Agent's
compensation. The obligations of Buyer and Seller under this Section shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of
Escrow Agent.

  


 

  

(b) _Disbursements from Escrow Funds to Pay Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent is
authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the Escrow Funds, from time to
time, the amount of any compensation and reimbursement of reasonable and
documented expenses due and payable hereunder (including any amount to which
Escrow Agent or any other Indemnified Party is entitled to seek

9  

  


 

  

(c) _Offset_. Buyer and Seller hereby grant to Escrow Agent and the other
Indemnified Parties a right of offset against the Escrow Funds with respect to
any compensation or reimbursement due any of them hereunder (including any
claim for indemnification hereunder). If for any reason the Escrow Funds are
insufficient to cover such compensation and reimbursement, Buyer and Seller

that, without limiting the joint and several nature of their obligations to
Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller agree between themselves that each will be
responsible to the other for 50% of such compensation and reimbursement.

  


 

  

13. _Representations and Warranties_. Buyer and Seller each respectively make the following representations and warranties to Escrow Agent:

  


 

  

(a) it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder; and this Agreement has been duly
approved by all necessary action and constitutes its valid and binding
agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

(b) each of the applicable persons designated on Schedule C attached hereto
has been duly appointed to act as its authorized representative hereunder and
individually has full power and authority on its behalf to execute and deliver
any instruction or direction, to amend, modify or waive any provision of this
Agreement and to take any and all other actions as its authorized
representative under this Agreement and no change in designation of such
authorized representatives will be effective until written notice of such
change is delivered to each other party to this Agreement pursuant to Section
15 and Escrow Agent has had reasonable time to act upon it.

  

(c) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer and
Seller does not and will not violate any applicable law or regulation and no
printed or other material in any language, including any prospectus, notice,
report, and promotional material that mentions "U.S. Bank" or any of its
affiliates by name or the rights, powers, or duties of Escrow Agent under this
Agreement will be issued by any other parties hereto, or on such party's
behalf, without the prior written consent of Escrow Agent.

  

(d) it will not claim any immunity from jurisdiction of any court, suit or
legal process, whether from service of notice, injunction, attachment,
execution or enforcement of any judgment or otherwise.

  


 

  

(e) there is no security interest in the Escrow Funds or any part thereof and
no financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code is on file in any
jurisdiction claiming a security interest in or describing (whether
specifically or generally) the Escrow Funds or any part thereof.

  


 

  

14. _Identifying Information_. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, Escrow Agent requires documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. Escrow Agent may require financial statements, licenses or identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. Buyer and Seller agree to provide all information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with any legislation or regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely manner. Escrow Agent's appointment and acceptance of its duties under this Agreement is contingent upon verification of all regulatory requirements applicable to Buyer, Seller and any of their permitted assigns, including successful completion of a final background check. These conditions include, without limitation, requirements under the USA PATRIOT Act, the USA FREEDOM Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. If these conditions are not met, Escrow Agent may at its option promptly terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, and refuse any otherwise permitted assignment by Buyer or Seller, without any liability or incurring any additional costs.

each, at their own cost and expense, during the Term hereof, carry a policy of
commercial general liability insurance in an amount not less than One Million

it may have against the other party for loss to the Leased Premises or the
properties in which the Leased Premises is located, or to the contents thereof
or personal property located therein, due to fire or any other peril covered
by insurance, including such losses as may be due to the negligence of such
other party, its agents or employees, but only to the extent of amounts
recovered by reason of insurance carried by the waiving party. Additionally,
each party waives the subrogation rights of its insurer with respect to damage
or destruction, provided that such waiver shall not serve to invalidate the
insurance coverage.

7.

  |  

Utilities. Lessor shall, at Lessor's sole cost, ensure that all utilities are

provided that Lessee shall be responsible for payment for such service as set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement. In the event of any interruption
of utility service to the Leased Premises that continues for more than four
(4) consecutive business days, and that results in Lessee being unable to use
the Leased Premises for Lessee's intended use, in Lessee's reasonable
discretion, all Base Rent due under this Lease for the portion of the Leased
Premises impacted by such interruption shall abate until such time as Lessee
determines, in Lessee's sole but reasonable discretion, that the portion of
the Leased Premises so impacted is again able to be used for Lessee's intended
use.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

8.

  |  

Damage, Destruction, or Condemnation. If the Leased Premises or the property
in which a portion of the Leased Premises is located is damaged or destroyed
by fire or other casualty, or condemned or taken by eminent domain, to an
extent that Lessee determines, in Lessee's reasonable discretion, that such
portion of the Leased Premises is no longer useable for the purposes set forth
herein, Lessee shall have the right, within thirty (30) days after the date of
such casualty or damage, or within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of
such pending condemnation or taking, to deliver written notice to Lessor
terminating this Lease as to such portion of the Leased Premises, with such
termination effective as of the date of such casualty, damage, or taking. If,
following any casualty, damage, or taking, this Lease is not terminated as set
forth in the previous sentence, Lessor shall, at Lessor's expense, promptly
and in a good and workmanlike manner, restore such portion of the Leased
Premises and the property in which it is located to its condition prior to
such casualty, damage, or taking. If, during repair and restoration of damaged
portions of the properties or Leased Premises, all or any portion of the
Leased Premises is deemed unusable by Lessee, in Lessee's reasonable
discretion, then Base Rent shall be abated with respect to such portion of the
Leased Premises until such time as such portion of the Leased Premises is
again usable for Lessee's intended use.

Successors and Assigns. This Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of the

Lessee shall not assign this Lease or any interest herein, nor sublet,
encumber, or assign the Leased Premises or any part thereof, absent Lessor\'s
prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld by Lessor in
its sole discretion; provided, however, Lessee may, upon written notice to

additional services so provided by Buyer or its Affiliates shall constitute
Buyer Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the
provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on a Buyer Service Exhibit
as of the date hereof.

  

 

2  

  


 

  

(g) The parties hereto acknowledge the transitional nature of the Seller
Services and Buyer Services. Accordingly, as promptly as practicable following

alternate third-party sources to provide the Seller Services and Buyer
Services, as applicable.

  


 

  

(h) Subject to Section 2.03, Section 2.04, and Section 3.05, the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement to provide Seller Services or Buyer

Services set out on one or more of the Seller Service Exhibit or that it does
not require such Seller Services for the entire period up to the applicable
End Date. Accordingly, Buyer may terminate any Seller Service, in whole and
not in part, upon notification to Seller in writing of any such determination.

same standard of care as historically provided. Subject to Section 1.03,
Seller and Parent agree to assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel
as are reasonably required to perform the Seller Services in accordance with
the standards set forth in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Seller and Parent are not in the business

for the purpose of facilitating the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Except as expressly set forth in Section 1.02(a) or in any contract
entered into hereunder, Seller and Parent make no representations and
warranties of any kind, implied or expressed, with respect to the Seller

fitness for a particular purpose, which are specifically disclaimed. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary
relationship, partnership, joint venture, or relationships of trust or agency
between the parties and that all Seller Services are provided by Seller and
Parent as an independent contractor.

(c) Buyer represents, warrants, and agrees that the Buyer Services shall be
provided in good faith, in accordance with applicable law and, except as
specifically provided in the Buyer Service Exhibit, in a manner generally
consistent with the historical provision of the Buyer Services and with the
same standard of care as historically provided. Subject to Section 1.03, Buyer
agrees to assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel as are
reasonably required to perform the Buyer Services in accordance with the
standards set forth in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller and Parent acknowledge that Buyer and the Companies are not in the
business of providing the Buyer Services and are providing the Buyer Services
solely for the purpose of facilitating the transactions contemplated by the

acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary
relationship, partnership, joint venture, or relationships of trust or agency
between the parties and that all Buyer Services are provided by Buyer as an

Section 1.03 Third-Party Service Providers. It is understood and agreed that
each party has been retaining, and will continue to retain, third-party
service providers to provide some of the Seller Services or Buyer Services, as
applicable. In addition, the parties shall have the right to hire other third-
party subcontractors to provide all or part of any Seller Service or Buyer
Services, as applicable, hereunder; provided, however, that in the event such
subcontracting is inconsistent with past practices or such subcontractor is
not already engaged with respect to such Seller Service or Buyer Service as of
the date hereof, the party receiving services shall obtain the prior written
consent of the other party to hire such subcontractor, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. Each party shall in all cases retain responsibility for
the provision to the other party of Seller Services or Buyer Services, as
applicable, to be performed by any third-party service provider or
subcontractor or by any of a party's Affiliates.

  


 

  

Section 1.04 Mutual Cooperation. During the term of this Agreement, the
parties shall consult with each other at regular intervals and at such times
as may be reasonably requested with respect to the performance of the Seller
Services or the Buyer Services. Additionally, the parties shall take such
actions as may be commercially reasonable and reasonably necessary or
desirable in order to enable or assist, on the one hand, the Seller and Parent
in providing the Seller Services and, on the other, the Buyer and the
Companies in providing the Buyer Services, including exchanging information
and providing electronic access to data systems used in connection with the
Seller Services or Buyer Services.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II

  

Compensation

  


 

  

Section 2.01 Responsibility for Wages and Fees.

  


 

  

(a) For such time as any employees of Seller, Parent, or any of their
Affiliates are providing the Seller Services under this Agreement, (a) such
employees will remain employees of Seller, Parent, or such Affiliate, as
applicable, and shall not be deemed to be employees of Buyer or the Companies
for any purpose, and (b) Seller, Parent, or such Affiliate, as applicable,
shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all wages,
bonuses, and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and worker\'s
compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating to
such employment.

  

 

4  

  

(b) For such time as any employees of Buyer, the Companies, or any of their
Affiliates are providing the Buyer Services under this Agreement, (a) such
employees will remain employees of Buyer, the Companies, or such Affiliate, as
applicable, and shall not be deemed to be employees of Seller or Parent for
any purpose, and (b) Buyer, the Companies, or such Affiliate, as applicable,
shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all wages,
bonuses, and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and worker\'s
compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating to
such employment.

  


 

  

Section 2.02 Terms of Payment and Related Matters.

  


 

  

(a) As consideration for provision of the Seller Services, Buyer shall pay
Seller the amount specified for each Seller Service on the Seller Service
Exhibit.

  


 

  

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Seller Service Exhibit or Buyer
Service Exhibit and subject to the terms and conditions therein, payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be made on the first day of each month until
the End Date (as the same may be extended), except payroll services and
payroll tax obligations incurred in connection with Seller Services or Buyer
Services, as applicable, which shall be paid or funded in advance. It is the
intent of the parties that the compensation set forth in the Seller Service
Exhibit and Buyer Service Exhibit, respectively, reasonably approximate the
cost of providing the Seller Services and Buyer Services, respectively,
including the cost of employee wages and compensation, without any intent to
cause Seller to receive profit or incur loss. If at any time Seller or Buyer
believes that the payments contemplated by a specific Seller Service Exhibit
or Buyer Service Exhibit, as applicable, are materially insufficient to
compensate it for the cost of providing the Seller Services it is obligated to
provide hereunder, or Buyer or Seller believes that the payments contemplated
by a specific Seller Service Exhibit or Buyer Service Exhibit, as applicable,
materially overcompensate Seller or for such Seller Services or Buyer
Services, as applicable, such party shall notify the other party as soon as
possible, and the parties hereto will commence good faith negotiations toward
an agreement in writing as to the appropriate course of action with respect to
pricing of such Seller Services or Buyer Services for future periods.

  


 

  

Section 2.03 Extension of Services. The parties agree that neither party shall
be obligated to perform any Seller Service or Buyer Service, as applicable,
after the applicable End Date; provided, however, that if one party desires
and other party agrees to continue to perform any Seller Service or Buyer
Service, as applicable, after the applicable End Date, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to determine an amount that compensates the party
performing the services for all of its costs for such performance, including
the time of its employees. The Seller Services or Buyer Services, as
applicable, so performed after the applicable End Date shall continue to
constitute Seller Services or Buyer Services, as applicable, under this
Agreement and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this Agreement
for the duration of the agreed-upon extension period.

  

 

5  

  


 

  

Section 2.04 Terminated Services. Upon termination or expiration of any or all
Seller Services and Buyer Services pursuant to this Agreement, or upon the
termination of this Agreement in its entirety, the parties shall have no
further obligation to provide the applicable terminated Seller Services and
Buyer Service.

  


 

  

Section 2.05 Disputes. In the event of a dispute regarding amounts owed for
Seller Services or Buyer Services, the disputing party shall deliver a written
statement to the other party no later than ten (10) days prior to the date
payment is due for the disputed Seller Service or Buyer Service, as
applicable, listing all disputed items and providing a reasonably detailed
description of each disputed item. Amounts not so disputed shall be deemed
accepted and shall be paid, notwithstanding disputes on other items, within
the period set forth in Section 2.02(b). The parties shall seek to resolve all
such disputes expeditiously and in good faith. The parties shall continue
performing the Seller Services and Buyer Services in accordance with this
Agreement pending resolution of any dispute.

  


 

  

Section 2.06 Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for all sales or use Taxes
imposed or assessed as a result of the provision of Seller Services. Seller
shall be responsible for all sales or use Taxes imposed or assessed as a
result of the provision of Buyer Services.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  

Termination

  


 

  

Section 3.01 Termination of Agreement. Subject to Section 3.04, this Agreement
shall terminate in its entirety (i) on the date upon which the parties shall
have no continuing obligation to perform any Seller Services and Buyer
Services, as applicable, as a result of each of their expiration or
termination in accordance with Section 1.01(g) or Section 3.02 or (ii) in
accordance with Section 3.03.

  


 

  

Section 3.02 Breach. Any party (the "Non-Breaching Party") may terminate this
Agreement with respect to any Seller Service or Buyer Service, in whole but
not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the other party (the
"Breaching Party") if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to
Section 3.05) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement
relating to such Seller Service or Buyer Service, as applicable, and such
failure shall have continued without cure for a period of fifteen (15) days
after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from
the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such service. For the avoidance
of doubt, non-payment by Buyer or Seller for a Seller Service or Buyer
Service, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement and not the subject
of a good-faith dispute, shall be deemed a breach for purposes of this Section
3.02.

  

 

6  

  


 

  

Section 3.03 Insolvency. In the event that either party hereto shall (i) file
a petition in bankruptcy, (ii) become or be declared insolvent, or become the
subject of any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to
its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (iii) make an
assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of its creditors, or (iv)
take any corporate action for its winding up or dissolution, then the other
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice in accordance with Section 6.01.

  


 

  

Section 3.04 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement in its
entirety pursuant to Section 3.01, all obligations of the parties hereto shall
terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.06, Article IV, Article V,
and Article VI, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 3.05 Force Majeure. The obligations under this Agreement with respect
to any Seller Service or Buyer Service, as applicable, shall be suspended
during the period and to the extent that Seller, Parent, Buyer, or any of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, is prevented or hindered from
providing such Seller Service or Buyer Service, as applicable, or any party is
prevented or hindered from receiving such Seller Service or Buyer Service, as
applicable, due to any of the following causes beyond such party\'s reasonable
control (such causes, "Force Majeure Events"): (i) acts of God, (ii) flood,
fire or explosion, (iii) war, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, (iv) Order
or any law, (v) actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date
of this Agreement, (vi) action by any Governmental Authority, (vii) national
or regional emergency, (viii) strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other
industrial disturbances, (ix) shortage of adequate power or transportation
facilities, or (x) any other event which is beyond the reasonable control of
such party. The party suffering a Force Majeure Event shall give notice of
suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the other party stating the
date and extent of such suspension and the cause thereof, and Seller, Parent,
Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall resume the
performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the
removal of the cause. Neither Buyer, Parent, Seller, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall be liable for the nonperformance or delay in
performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement when such
failure is due to a Force Majeure Event. The applicable End Date for any
Seller Service or Buyer Services, as applicable, so suspended shall be
automatically extended for a period of time equal to the time lost by reason
of the suspension.

including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets,
designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other proprietary
or confidential information, however recorded or preserved, whether written or
oral (any such information, "Confidential Information"). Each party hereto
shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to
protect the other party\'s Confidential Information as it uses to protect its
own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise authorized in
any other agreement between the parties, any party receiving any Confidential
Information of the other party (the "Receiving Party") may use Confidential
Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement (the "Permitted Purpose"). Any Receiving Party may disclose such
Confidential Information only to its representatives who have a need to know
such information for the Permitted Purpose and who have been advised of the
terms of this Section 4.01 and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any
breach of these confidentiality provisions by such Persons; provided, however,
that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the
extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by an Order,
in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent
possible, the disclosing party (the "Disclosing Party"), and take reasonable
steps to assist in contesting such Order or in protecting the Disclosing
Party\'s rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party
shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its
counsel in writing that it is legally bound to disclose under such Order.

  

 

7  

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not
include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (i) was
publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known
through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this
Section 4.01; (ii) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty
of confidentiality; or (iii) was developed by it independently without any
reliance on the Confidential Information.

  


 

  

(c) Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement with respect to any Seller Service or Buyer
Service, as applicable, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or
destroy, at the Disclosing Party\'s option, all Confidential Information. If
such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the
Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction in writing.

misconduct of Seller, Parent, or their Affiliates that provide a Seller
Service to Buyer or the Companies pursuant to Section 1.03 in connection with

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under Section 5.01 by Seller and Parent

any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the Buyer Indemnified
Parties receive any amounts from any other Person alleged to be responsible
for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by Seller or Parent,
then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall promptly reimburse Seller and Parent

Buyer Indemnified Parties, net of any expenses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in collecting such amount.

ROLLING STOCK LEASE

  


 

  

[See Attached.]

  

  

  

    

  

LEASE AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Lease Agreement (" _Agreement_ ") is made as of April 1, 2019 by and
among MF Holdings, Inc., or its assignee (" _Lessor_ "), and Celadon Trucking
Services, Inc. (" _Lessee_ ").

  


 

  

 _Background._ Prior to the date hereof, Lessee was the owner and/or operator
of certain tractors and trailers comprising the Rolling Stock (as defined
below) and owned the license plates and other operating permits issued in the
base plate state directly and on behalf of other states (collectively, the "
_Licenses_ "). Pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement, dated of even date
herewith, by and among Lessor, the Companies named therein, Lessee, and
Celadon Group, Inc., as Parent (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), Lessor has
acquired the Rolling Stock. The parties now desire that (i) Lessee lease back
the Rolling Stock from Lessor for the period commencing on the date hereof
(the " _Commencement Date_ ") and continuing for the period determined by
Lessor (the " _Lease Term_ ") (provided, however, that this Agreement shall
terminate automatically on the date on which any License with respect to any
item of Rolling Stock expires, and if this Agreement does not so automatically
terminate, Lessor shall promptly reimburse Lessee for the full amount required
to renew such License for the next successive term), and (ii) simultaneously
herewith, Lessee and Lessor enter into an Equipment Lease pursuant to which
Lessee will sublease the Rolling Stock back to Lessor during the Lease Term
(the " _Equipment Lease_ ").

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  


 

  

1. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed in the Purchase Agreement.

  


 

  

2. Lessor hereby leases the tractors and trailers set forth on the attached Exhibit A (the " _Rolling Stock_ ") to Lessee for the Lease Term.

  


 

  

3. The rental under this Agreement for the entire Lease Term shall be $100, which shall be payable in cash by Lessee on the Commencement Date and shall be non-refundable.

  


 

  

4. Throughout the Lease Term, Lessor shall provide all required insurance on the Rolling Stock (including liability insurance in connection with the use and operation thereof, which shall name Lessee as an additional insured) at its sole cost and expense. Lessor, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lessee, other members of the Seller Group, and each of their respective directors, managers, officers, and employees, against any Losses resulting from this Agreement or the use and operation of the Rolling Stock (except as expressly provided under Section 5 hereof), including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of defending against any Proceeding related to the foregoing in which any member of the Seller Group is named, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

  


 

  

5. Lessee shall use the Rolling Stock only in accordance with this Agreement and the Equipment Lease. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any rights hereunder, or any attempted use of the Rolling Stock except as contemplated by the Equipment Lease, shall be void and immediately terminate this Agreement. Lessee agrees to indemnify Lessor against all Losses as a result of any violation of this section by Lessee.

    

  


 

  

6. During the Lease Term, Lessee shall use its best efforts to keep the Licenses in full force and effect; provided, however, Lessee shall not be required to incur any expense in connection therewith unless Lessor agrees to fully and promptly reimburse Lessee for such expense.

  


 

  

7. This Agreement shall be terminable by Lessor at any time and shall terminate automatically if (i) Lessee becomes insolvent, ceases to do business as a going concern, dissolves, changes the legal form in which it operates, or (ii) a petition for an order for relief with respect to Lessee is filed by or against Lessee under Title 11 of the United States Code.

EQUIPMENT LEASE

  


 

  

This Equipment Lease (" _Lease_ ") is made as of April 1, 2019 by and among MF
Holdings, Inc., or its assignee (" _Lessee_ "), and Celadon Trucking Services,
Inc. (" _Lessor_ ").

  


 

  

 _Background._ Lessor and Lessee are parties to that certain Purchase
Agreement, dated of even date herewith, by and among Lessee, the Companies
named therein, Lessor, and Celadon Group, Inc., as Parent (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "), and that certain Lease Agreement of even date herewith between
the parties hereto (the " _Underlying Lease_ " and, together with the Purchase
Agreement, the " _Prior Agreements_ "). Pursuant to the Prior Agreements,
Lessor has control over the Rolling Stock (as defined below) and has licensed
such Rolling Stock with the requisite state authorities. By virtue of this
Lease, the parties desire that Lessor lease such licensed Rolling Stock to
Lessee.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  


 

  

1. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed in the Prior Agreements.

  


 

  

2. Lessor hereby leases all of its right, title, and interest in and to the tractors and trailers set forth on the attached Exhibit A (the " _Rolling Stock_ ") to Lessee for a period of 29 days, which term shall be automatically renewed for successive 29 day periods unless terminated by Lessee (which termination may occur at any time upon notice and which shall occur automatically upon termination of the Underlying Lease). For the avoidance of doubt, this Lease shall terminate automatically on the date on which any License with respect to any item of Rolling Stock expires, and if this Lease does not so automatically terminate, Lessee shall promptly reimburse Lessor for the full amount required to renew such License for the next successive term.

  


 

  

3. During the term hereof, Lessor shall use its best efforts to keep the Licenses in full force and effect; provided, however, Lessor shall not be required to incur any expense in connection therewith unless Lessee agrees to fully and promptly reimburse Lessor for such expense.

  


 

  

4. The rental under this Lease for the entire Lease Term shall be $100, which shall be payable in cash on the date hereof and shall be non-refundable.

  


 

  

5. During the Lease Term, Lessee covenants and agrees to (i) use the Rolling Stock solely in connection with its business of transporting freight, (ii) maintain the Rolling Stock at Lessee\'s sole cost and expense, and (iii) provide all required insurance on the Rolling Stock (including liability insurance in connection with the use and operation thereof, which shall name Lessor as an additional insured) at its sole cost and expense. Lessee, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lessor, other members of the Seller Group, and each of their respective directors, managers, officers, and employees, against any Losses resulting from this Lease or the use and operation of the Rolling Stock, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of defending against any Proceeding related to the foregoing in which any member of the Seller Group is named, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
