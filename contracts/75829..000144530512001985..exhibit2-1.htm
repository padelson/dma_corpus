Letter</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&#148;) to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein and in any related fee letter, financing in the amounts set

and fully executed copy of each commitment letter entered into in connection
with any Alternate Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Buyer, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to

date of this Agreement Buyer has no reason to believe that the full amount of
the Financing will not be available to be drawn down at the Initial Closing or

Price at the Initial Closing. Any commitment letter in respect of any Alternate
Financing arranged pursuant to </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Section

Buyer, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors&#146; rights and to

Financing) is funded in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter (and
any commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing), the net proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (and any commitment letter in respect of
any Alternate Financing) will, together with cash that will be available to
Buyer on the Initial Closing Date, in the aggregate be sufficient for Buyer to
pay the Initial Closing Purchase Price and to pay all fees and expenses related
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Commitment Letter has not
been amended or modified, and to the Knowledge of Buyer no such amendment or
modification is contemplated (other than amendments or modifications that are
permitted by </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Section 5.7</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2> or for which the Company has provided its express prior
written consent), and the respective obligations and commitments of the
Financing Sources contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect, (ii) there are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and in any
related fee letter and (iii) there are no other agreements, arrangements or
understandings (written or oral) relating to the Financing (other than the
Commitment Letter and any related fee letter) that will impair or delay the
Initial Closing or the availability of the Financing on the Initial Closing
Date. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees in

the actual damages to be incurred by the non-breaching Party under the

appropriate legal action that may be brought against such Third Party, taking

likelihood that any such action might impair or otherwise affect the scope of
the Licensed Patents, the likelihood that failure to initiate or defend legal
proceedings might impair or otherwise negatively affect Haemonetics&#146; ability to
commercialize the Product Lines and other similar factors. In the event that the

Period, the Company shall provide Haemonetics reasonable assistance, at
Haemonetics&#146; cost and expense, in connection with the sale of Finished Goods
Inventory and Transition Finished Products in the Territory. Such assistance
shall consist of: (i) consultation regarding the historical experience of the
Company with respect to its manufacturing site registrations, product
registrations, listings, licensing and labeling in each Country; (ii) the
introduction to Haemonetics of the primary local contacts, if any, or
governmental contacts used by the Company with respect to its manufacturing site
registrations, product registrations, listings, licensing and labeling in each
Country; and (iii) delivery to Haemonetics of any records or documentation
regarding the Company&#146;s manufacturing site registrations, product registrations,
listings, licensing and labeling that Haemonetics is entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement (the &#147;</FONT><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Company Records</FONT></B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&#148;). For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to provide any regulatory or
legal advice to Haemonetics or to prepare any filings or other documentation for
any Country, except for customary seller notices to Governmental Entities or as
may be required by Law in a Country in order to permit Haemonetics to meet its
own regulatory requirements for manufacturing site registrations, product
registrations, listings, licensing and/or labeling in such Country. Haemonetics
shall pay the Company for such services at the rate set forth in Section 5(a)(i)
of the Master Transition Services Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and
between Haemonetics and the Company; </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>provided</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2> that no payment shall be
required in connection with the delivery of the Company Records to Haemonetics.
The Company shall invoice Haemonetics monthly for all charges pursuant to this
Agreement in U.S. dollars at the end of each month. Such invoices shall be
accompanied by reasonable documentation or other reasonable explanations
supporting such charges. Invoices shall be due and payable within 30 days after
the date of the invoice. Payments may be made by check or wire transfer. All
payments shall be made without offsets or deductions. If Haemonetics believes
that there is any error in an invoice delivered by the Company, Haemonetics must
notify the Company of such error within 60 days after Haemonetics&#146; receipt of
such invoice. Haemonetics hereby waives the right to dispute any invoice on the
basis of purported error if Haemonetics fails to provide such written notice to
the Company within such 60-day period. Any undisputed portion of an invoice that
is not paid when due shall accrue interest at the lesser of (i) one and one-half
percent (1&#189;%) per month, or (ii) the highest rate of interest permitted by
applicable Law until such invoiced portion and all such interest is
paid.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

specific regulatory requirements for manufacturing site registrations, product
registrations, listings, licensing and labeling in each Country for both
Finished Goods Inventory and Transition Finished Products. Haemonetics will
notify the Company of the results of its analysis, and the Parties must agree in
writing on how Finished Goods Inventory and Transition Finished Products will be
labeled for sale in each such Country (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) prior to the sale of any such Finished Goods Inventory and
Transition Finished Products in each such Country. If the Parties agree in
writing that a particular Country permits Haemonetics to rely on the Company&#146;s
prior manufacturing site registrations, product registrations, listings,
licensing and/or labeling to market, sell and distribute Finished Goods
Inventory or Transition Finished Products in such Country, Haemonetics may, in
the manner agreed to between the Parties, during the Transition Period or such
shorter period as may be prescribed by applicable Law, market, sell and
distribute the Finished Goods Inventory and Transition Finished Products in such
Country utilizing the Company&#146;s applicable form of product label
(&#147;</FONT><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Company Labels</FONT></B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&#148;). Haemonetics is responsible for complying with all labeling and/or
relabeling requirements that the applicable Governmental Entities in such
Country may apply to the sale of such Finished Goods Inventory and Transition
Finished Products in such Country. The Company will provide reasonable
assistance to Haemonetics with respect to the transition of labeling of Finished
Products manufactured by Haemonetics to be marketed, sold and distributed in the
Territory during the Transition Period. Haemonetics agrees not to sell any
products utilizing the Company Labels (i) except as agreed to by the Parties as
provided in this Section 2.2, (ii) in any Country where such sale would be
unlawful or (iii) without the prior written consent of the Company, in any
country where the Company did not sell Finished Products prior to the Initial
Closing Date. </FONT></P>

applicable Company Records to Haemonetics in accordance with Section 2.1 above,
Haemonetics shall submit all initial filings required to obtain the
manufacturing site registration, product registration, listing, licensing and/or
labeling applicable to the manufacture and sale of Finished Products in each
Country (the &#147;</FONT><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Initial Filings</FONT></B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&#148;) within 12 months following the Initial Closing Date.
Haemonetics agrees to provide the Company with a summary report on at least a
monthly basis during the Transition Period describing the status of the Initial
Filings and Haemonetics&#146; plan to cease using the Company Labels in each Country.
If the Company has provided the applicable Company Records to Haemonetics in
accordance with Section 2.1 and Haemonetics has not, for any reason, fully
completed its Initial Filings within such 12 month period in a particular
Country, Haemonetics may not continue to distribute or sell Company labeled
product in that Country after the expiration of such 12 month period.

</FONT>Haemonetics may, from time to time and in its sole discretion during the
Term, remove one or more of the Territories and thereby reduce the number of
Territories subject to this Agreement. Haemonetics will provide Distributor with
as much notice as reasonably possible but in no event less than thirty (30) days
advance notice of the removal of any Territory. For Territories removed by

Haemonetics is obligated under the terms of the APA to offer such Qualified
Employees employment. Subject to the agreement of the Qualified Employee, any
Qualified Employee who is providing services under this Agreement but who wishes
to accept Haemonetics&#146; offer of employment shall remain in the employ of
Distributor during the relevant Term (subject to the Distributor&#146;s customary
conditions of employment) in order to facilitate Distributor&#146;s provision of
services under this Agreement during the relevant Term. Upon the expiration or
early termination of the Term for a particular Territory, the corresponding
Qualified Employees who have accepted Haemonetics&#146; offer of employment shall
become Transferred Employees as defined in the APA. Haemonetics shall reimburse
Distributor for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Distributor in
connection with the employment of such Qualified Employees, including without
limitation, all wages, employment taxes and withholding, vacation, benefits and
any other additional costs that may be incurred in connection with their
continued employment for the period between the Initial Closing (as defined in
the APA) and expiration or early termination of the Term in respect of the

3.2 hereof. For avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that in any
event, the entire Agreement shall expire no later than the date that is six (6)
months following the Initial Closing Date. Upon the expiration (or earlier
termination) of the Term in a particular Territory, the Agreement will terminate
without further action of either party. Notwithstanding the termination of the
Agreement (in whole or in part), each party shall continue to be obligated to
pay over any amounts due to the other party as provided under the terms of this

Expenses and Property Taxes to be incurred for such calendar year and a property
management plan for upcoming projects, which shall be subject to Lessee&#146;s review

within said twenty (20) days the proposed budget shall be deemed approved.
Tenant shall pay the amounts of Additional Rent, as set forth in the approved

Commencement Date. If at the beginning of any calendar year the budget for said
year has not been agreed to then pending agreement on the budget (i) any items
or portions of the budget which have been agreed to shall become operative
immediately, (ii) Lessor shall have the right to expend in respect of recurring
expenses amounts equal to the budgeted amount for the immediately preceding
calendar year as increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in
the Index during the immediately preceding twelve month period, and (iii) Lessor
shall have the right to expend funds in respect of utilities, taxes,
assessments, insurance (including deductibles) and emergency repairs regardless
of whether they exceed previously agreed upon amounts or amounts set forth in a
previously agreed to budget. If Lessor determines that Expenses will exceed the
approved budget at any time during such calendar year, Lessor shall promptly
notify Lessee and describe the reason for such excess Expenses. Within ninety
(90) days after the end of each calendar year, Lessor shall furnish Lessee with
a statement (the &#147;</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Additional Rent Adjustment
Statement</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&#148;) of the actual costs of Property
Taxes and Expenses for the preceding calendar year for which estimated payments
were billed. If the actual cost of Additional Rent is greater than Lessee&#146;s

cost of Additional Rent is less than Lessee&#146;s estimated payments on account
thereof, Lessor shall credit any excess payments to Lessee&#146;s next due payment of
Additional Rent, or if no payments are next due, Lessor shall refund such excess
payment to Lessee. Any annual statement furnished by Lessor pertaining to
Additional Rent which is not disputed by Lessee in writing within one hundred

Lessor&#146;s books and records establishing Expenses and Property Taxes for any
calendar year for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the date
that Lessee receives the Additional Rent Adjustment Statement for such year from
Lessor. If such audit reveals an error in any line item, Lessee shall have the
right to audit and challenge the same line item in the prior two Additional Rent
Adjustment Statements. Lessee shall give Lessor not less than thirty (30) days&#146;
prior notice of its intention to examine and audit such books and records, and
such examination and audit shall take place in the Building or such other
location where Lessor routinely maintains such books and records. All costs of
the examination and audit shall be borne by Lessee; provided, however, that if
such examination and audit establishes that the actual Expenses or Property
Taxes for the year in question are less than the amount set forth as the annual
Expenses or Property Taxes on the Additional Rent Adjustment Statement by at
least five percent (5%), then Lessor shall pay the reasonable costs of such
examination and audit. If, pursuant to the audit, the payments made for such
year by Lessee exceed Lessee&#146;s required payment on account thereof for such
year, Lessor shall credit the amount of overpayment against subsequent
obligations of Lessee with respect to Rent (or promptly refund such overpayment
if the Term of this Lease has ended and Lessee has no further obligation to
Lessor); but, if the payments made by Lessee for such year are less than
Lessee&#146;s required payment as established by the examination and audit, Lessee

such Lease Transfer prohibited by the preceding sentences need not be recognized

Lessor shall promptly request, and Lessee shall promptly furnish to Lessor,

proposed transferee has sufficient financial worth to fully and timely discharge
all of the then remaining obligations of Lessee under this Lease, (b) the
proposed transferee is of sound business reputation, (c) the form of the
proposed assignment or sublease is satisfactory to Lessor, (d) Lessee has
reimbursed Lessor for out of pocket, third party costs incurred by Lessor in
connection with the assignment or sublease, including without limitation, the
reasonable costs of making investigations as to the acceptability of the

taken, that the portion thereof not so taken cannot be repaired or reconstructed
as to constitute a complete project capable of being operated for the purposes

the Premises but creating a right to compensation therefor, such as, but not

full force and effect without reduction or abatement of any Rent thereafter due
and payable. If such governmental action results in any damage to an Improvement
located on the Land, Lessor shall be entitled to receive such portion of the
proceeds (or all of the proceeds, if required for the purpose) estimated to be
necessary to remedy any such damage, and Lessor shall, subject to Unavoidable
Delays, forthwith complete all construction necessary to so remedy such damage.
Any balance remaining from such proceeds, or if no damage is involved, then all
of such proceeds shall be divided between Lessor and Lessee as their respective
interests may appear. </FONT></P>

respect thereto; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall prevent
Lessee from applying for reimbursement from the condemning authority (if
permitted by law) for Lessee&#146;s remaining leasehold interest, moving expenses, or
the expense of removal of Lessee's trade fixtures and Alterations, but if and

respective interests of Lessor and Lessee in the Premises and there is a dispute
respecting the proper allocation of awards payable under the circumstances

thirty (30) days after the amount of the total award is finally determined, then
any such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the rules of the American

Lessee if required in the event of an emergency. Nothing in this Section 10.1 or

which might be or become a lien, encumbrance or charge upon the Premises or any

deemed or construed in any way as constituting the consent or request of Lessor,
express or implied by inference or otherwise, to any contractor, subcontractor,
laborer or materialman for the performance of any labor or the furnishing of any
materials for any specific improvement, alteration to or repair of the Premises
or any part thereof, nor as giving Lessee any right, power or authority to

respect to the Premises for Lessee, upon credit, and that no mechanic&#146;s or other

beyond applicable notice and cure periods, Lessee and those so claiming under
Lessee shall lawfully, peacefully and quietly have, hold, use, occupy, possess

termination as herein specified, such occupancy, shall not in any manner extend
the Term or renew this Lease nor in any manner affect or impair Lessor&#146;s other

shall be an amount equal to 150% of fair market rent determined by a qualified
expert selected by Lessor for each month or part thereof such holdover

such other default which, by reason of the nature thereof or Unavoidable Delays,

on the date specified in such Notice, and upon the date specified in such
Notice, this Lease and the Term hereby demised, and all rights of the Lessee

possession thereafter by Lessee shall constitute a forcible detainer of the
Premises. Upon termination of Lessee&#146;s right to possession, as aforesaid,
whether this Lease be terminated or not, Lessee agrees to surrender possession
of the Premises immediately, without the receipt of any demand for rent, Notice

thereof, with or without process of law (if then permitted under the law),
without being liable to indictment, prosecution or damages therefor, and to
expel and remove Lessee or any other Person who may be occupying the Premises,
or any part thereof. Lessor may use such force in and about expelling and
removing Lessee and said other Persons as may reasonably be necessary, and
Lessor may further repossess itself of the Premises as of its former estate, but
said entry and repossession of the Premises shall not constitute a trespass or
forcible entry or detainer, nor shall it cause a forfeiture or cancellation of
Rents or other sums due or to become due during the Term hereof, nor act as a
waiver of any covenant, agreement or promise herein contained to be performed by
Lessee. </FONT></P>

the Premises in such manner as to Lessor may seem necessary or advisable, and,
or let or relet the Premises or any parts thereof for the whole or any part of
what would be the balance of the Term if the same were to expire by lapse of
time, or for a longer period, in Lessor&#146;s name or as agent of Lessee, and out of
any rent connected with or received as a result of such letting or reletting
Lessor shall, first, pay to itself the cost and expense of retaking,
repossessing, repairing and, or altering the Premises, and the cost and expense
of removing all persons and property therefrom, including, but not limited to
the reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and other professionals engaged by
Lessor in connection therewith; second, pay to itself the cost and expense
sustained in securing any new Lessees, and, if Lessor shall maintain and operate
the Premises, the cost and expense of operating and maintaining the Premises;
and, third, pay to itself any balance remaining on account of the liability of
Lessee to Lessor. No re-entry by Lessor whether had or taken under summary
proceedings or otherwise, shall absolve or discharge Lessee from liability
hereunder. Lessor shall in no way be responsible or liable for any failure to
relet the Premises or any part thereof, or for any failure to collect any rent
due on any such reletting. Should any rent so collected by Lessor after the
aforementioned payments be insufficient to fully pay to Lessor a sum equal to
all such Rent and other payments and charges reserved herein, the deficiency
shall be paid by Lessee promptly after having billed therefor by Lessor.

giving notice to that effect to the other party within 20 days after the giving
of Lessee&#146;s Rent Notice, which notice shall include the name and address of the
initiating party&#146;s designated arbitrator. Within 30 days after the designation
of the initiating party&#146;s arbitrator, the other party shall give notice to the
initiating party of the name and address of such other party&#146;s designated
arbitrator. If the non-initiating party shall fail to timely appoint an

Association (AAA) to appoint an arbitrator on the non-initiating party&#146;s behalf.
Such two arbitrators shall have 30 days to appoint a third arbitrator who shall

days after such request and both parties shall be bound by any appointment so
made within such 30 day period. If no such third arbitrator shall have been
appointed within such 30 day period, either Lessor or Lessee may apply to the

Final Determination may not be lower than Lessee&#146;s initial determination of Fair
Market Value. If either party fails to submit a Final Determination, then
Lessor&#146;s initial determination or Lessee&#146;s initial determination, as applicable,

pursuant to this Section shall be borne by the parties equally, but each party
shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator, attorneys and experts and the
additional expenses of presenting its own proof. The arbitrators shall not have
the power to add to, modify or change any of the provisions of the Lease. Each
arbitrator shall have at least 15 years of experience in leasing and/or
valuation of properties similar to the Site. After a determination has been made
of the Fair Market Rent, the parties shall execute and deliver an instrument
setting forth the Fair Market Rent, but the failure to so execute and deliver
any such instrument shall not effect the determination of Fair Market Rent.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees to the
following: </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>(a) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Beneficiary, its successors, endorsees and assigns, as a primary obligor and not
merely as a surety, the due and punctual performance of all obligations, and the
payment of all amounts payable, from time to time, by [H SUBSIDIARY] under the
terms of the Agreement, when and as such amounts shall become due and payable,
whether on the due date therefor, upon stated maturity, by acceleration, on
demand or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement (all of the
foregoing being "Obligations"). In case of the failure of [H SUBSIDIARY] to
punctually perform or pay indefeasibly any such amounts, Guarantor hereby agrees
to perform, or cause to be performed, or to pay or cause to be paid any such
amounts, in full, punctually and indefeasibly when and as the same shall become
due and payable, whether on the due date therefor, upon stated maturity, by
acceleration, upon demand or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>(b) Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under this Guarantee
constitute a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and are
not in any way conditional or contingent upon any attempt to collect from or
enforce against [H SUBSIDIARY] all or any portion of the Obligations or upon any
other condition or contingency. Guarantor covenants that this Guarantee will not
be discharged except by final, complete, indefeasible and irrevocable payment
and performance of the Obligations contained in this Guarantee and the
Agreement. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>(c) Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under this Guarantee
shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances,
irrespective of (i) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Agreement
against [H SUBSIDIARY], (ii) any forbearance or delay in collecting or enforcing
any payment or other obligation under the Agreement, (iii) any waiver, consent,
extension, indulgence, compromise, release or other action or inaction under or
in respect of the Agreement, or any obligation or liability of [H </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>SUBSIDIARY], or any exercise or non-exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege under or in respect to any such instrument or
agreement or any such obligation or liability, (iv) any extension or renewal of,
or other change in the time, manner or place of payment, of or in any other term
of, any of the Obligations (including any increase in the amount of the
Obligations due and payable under the Agreement), (v) the acceptance by
Beneficiary of any additional security or any increase, substitution or change
therein, (vi) the release by Beneficiary of any security or any withdrawal
thereof or decrease therein, (vii) any failure or omission or delay on the part
of the Beneficiary to conform or comply with any term or provision of the
Agreement, (viii) any assignment of the Agreement or any subletting of all or
any portion of the Premises, (ix) any hold over by [H SUBSIDIARY] beyond the
term of the Agreement, (x) the existence of any claim, setoff, counterclaim,
defense or other rights which Guarantor may have at any time against the
Beneficiary, or any other person or entity, whether in connection with this
Guarantee, the Agreement, or any unrelated transaction, or (xi) any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a guarantor or which might otherwise limit recourse against
Guarantor; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Guarantee shall not be deemed to enlarge any Obligations of [H
SUBSIDIARY] under the Agreement, and all obligations of Guarantor hereunder
shall be limited in time and scope and in any other manner as [H SUBSIDIARY]&#146;s
Obligations are limited by the terms of the Agreement.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">____________________</FONT></P>

<DIV style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always"></DIV><BR>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>(d) The
Guarantor shall not exercise any rights against [H SUBSIDIARY] which it may
acquire by way of subrogation, by any payment under this Guarantee or otherwise,
until all of the Obligations have been paid in full. If any amount is paid to
the Guarantor on account of subrogation rights under this Guarantee at any time
when all of the Obligations have not been paid in full, the amount shall be held
in trust for the benefit of the Beneficiary and shall be promptly paid to the
Beneficiary to be credited and applied to the Obligations. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>(e) Guarantor further agrees that this Guarantee shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, payment, or any
part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be reinstated by
the Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of [H
SUBSIDIARY] or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. Upon
such rescission or reinstatement, Guarantor shall, at Guarantor's own expense,
promptly do, execute and deliver, and cause any relevant third party to do,
execute and deliver, all such acts and instruments as the Beneficiary may
require to reinstate this Guarantee. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT>(f) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of
the Obligations which accrues under the terms of the Agreement after the
commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding of or
against [H SUBSIDIARY] (or, if interest on any portion of the Obligations ceases
to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding,
such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Obligations under the
terms of the Agreement if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be
included in the Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantor and
Beneficiary that the Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantor pursuant to
this Guarantee shall be determined without regard to any rule of law or order
which may relieve [H SUBSIDIARY] of any portion of such Obligations. Guarantor
will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee
for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay Beneficiary, or allow the
claim of Beneficiary in respect of any such interest accruing after the date on
which such proceeding is commenced.</FONT></P>

the Obligations and shall be in full, without set-off or counterclaim and free
and clear of any tax, deduction or withholding of any kind. If Guarantor is
required by law to make any deduction or withholding from any payment to the
Beneficiary, Guarantor shall, together with such payment, pay an additional
amount so that after all applicable deductions or withholdings, the Beneficiary
actually receives for its benefit the full amount which it would have received
if no such deductions or withholdings had been required and shall pay the full
amount of any such deductions or withholding to the appropriate governmental
authority within the time required by applicable law. </FONT></P>

</FONT>No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guarantee nor consent to
any departure by Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the

and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
