AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July 1, 2011 by and among Compuware Corporation, a Michigan corporation
("Parent"), Compuware Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), dynaTrace software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Stockholders' Representative
designated herein. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative are collectively referred to herein as the "Parties," and
individually as a "Party." Certain other capitalized terms used herein are
defined in Section 7.1.

  

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
believe it is in the best interests of its corporation and its respective
stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through a statutory merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company as the corporation
surviving the merger (the "Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved
the Merger.

  

  

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration
set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

C. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Merger Sub as security
for certain obligations set forth in this Agreement and to fund the Expense
Fund.

  

  

D. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.

  

  

E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain key
employees have entered into a confidentiality, non-competition, non-
solicitation and development agreement to be effective at the Effective Time.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth in this Agreement, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance of such agreements, covenants and other premises, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged and accepted, the Parties agree as follows:

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is
sometimes referred to hereinafter as the "Surviving Corporation."

  

  

1.2 Effective Time. Unless another time and place is mutually agreed upon in
writing by Parent and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Dykema Gossett PLLC, 400 Renaissance Center,
Detroit, Michigan, as of the date hereof. The date upon which the Closing
occurs shall be referred to herein as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date,
the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate
of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with the
Delaware Secretary of State (the "Certificate of Merger"), in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing with the
Delaware Secretary of State shall be referred to herein as the "Effective
Time").

  

  

1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

    

  |  

1.4

  |  

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of incorporation; provided,
however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read substantially as follows (or such other name as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion): "The name of the corporation is
dynaTrace software, Inc."

  

  

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, each to hold the office of a director or officer of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of Delaware
Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as applicable.

  

  

1.6 Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Rights of Dissenting Stockholders.

  

  

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be $255,820,000 (the "Merger Consideration"). At Closing,
Parent shall make a capital contribution to Merger Sub and Merger Sub shall
(i) pay or cause to be paid the Merger Consideration, less the Escrow Amount,
less the Expense Amount, less the Third Party Expenses shown on Section
2.23(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with the Closing Payment
Spreadsheet; (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, an amount equal to
$25,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount") into the Escrow Fund; and (iii) deposit, or
cause to be deposited, $150,000 (the "Expense Amount") into the Expense Fund.
Merger Sub shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the
Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders and deliver, or cause to be
delivered, Merger Consideration payable to Vested Optionholders to the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries which will distribute such Merger
Consideration through their payrolls for Vested Optionholders who are
employees and through their accounts payable functions for Vested
Optionholders who are not employees. The Company shall cause to be paid, prior
to the Effective Time, the Third Party Expenses shown on Section 2.23(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders or the
Optionholders:

  

  

(i) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock and each outstanding share
of Preferred Stock (on as converted basis) (other than a Dissenting Share)
will be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right
to receive, without interest thereon, an amount of cash equal to approximately
$5.3073 per share (the amounts payable to each holder of Company Common Stock
and Preferred Stock shall be set forth on the Closing Payment Spreadsheet);

  

  

(ii) each Company Vested Option shall be cancelled and terminated and shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, without interest thereon, an amount of cash equal to approximately
$5.3073 per share, less the amount of any exercise price applicable thereto
(the amount payable to each holder of Company Vested Options shall be set
forth in the Closing Payment Spreadsheet);

  

  

(iii) each Company Option that is not a Company Vested Option and is set forth
on Schedule 1.6(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule shall be canceled and
terminated as of the Effective Time and converted into options to acquire
shares of common stock of Parent issued pursuant to the Compuware Corporation
2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time, on the same economic,
vesting and other terms as then applicable to such Company Option in
accordance with the requirements of 26 C.F.R. §1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and, for
purposes of "incentive stock options" (as defined in Code Section 422),
consistent with the conditions under Code Section 424(a) and the regulations
thereunder, which shall be evidenced by an option agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Converted Award"). The Converted Awards are
intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, as amended, and the
regulations and guidance issued thereunder ("Code Section 409A"); and

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) each outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent one share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and are held by any Stockholder who has not consented to the
approval of this Agreement and who has the right to demand, has properly
demanded in writing, and has not effectively withdrawn or lost an appraisal of
such shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance
with Section 262 of the Delaware Law (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall not be
converted into the right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration,
but rather shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section
262 of the Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to
appraisal, each such share of Company Capital Stock of such Dissenting
Stockholder shall no longer be considered a Dissenting Share and shall be
deemed to have converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in
Section 1.6(b), pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.8.
At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be canceled,
cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a stock
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive either payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law or the portion of
the Merger Consideration provided in Section 1.6(b), as the case may be, upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.8. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent of the Company's receipt of any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the Delaware Law, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing except to the
extent required by Delaware Law.

  

  

1.7 Cash-Out of Company Vested Options; Termination of Plans. Prior to the
Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions
and take all such other actions as may be necessary to provide that:

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) to the extent determined by such Board, the vesting of one or more Company
Options shall be accelerated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
order that those Company Options shall be included in the Company Vested
Options;

  

  

(b) each Company Unvested Option listed in Section 1.6(b)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be converted as specified in Section 1.6(b)(iii) and
each Company Unvested Option that is not listed in Section 1.6(b)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated; and

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

the Plan shall be terminated as of the Effective Time.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

1.8 Exchange and Payment Procedures. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall serve as
the Paying Agent for the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At the Effective Time,
Parent shall make a capital contribution to Merger Sub and Merger Sub shall
make available or cause to be made available (a) to the Paying Agent in
accordance with this Article I the portion of the Merger Consideration (less
the pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount and the Expense Amount based on the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) into which the Company
Capital Stock converts pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) and (b) to the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with this Article I the portion of the Merger
Consideration into which the Company Vested Options are convertible pursuant
to Section 1.6(b)(ii) (less the pro rata portion of Escrow Amount and the
Expense Amount based on the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section
1.6(b)). Each Stockholder and each holder of Company Vested Options shall be
deemed to have contributed a pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount
attributable to the Merger Consideration to the Escrow Fund and a pro rata
portion of the Expense Amount attributable to the Merger Consideration to the
Expense Fund.

  

  

(a) Company Capital Stock. Upon surrender by a Stockholder to the Paying Agent
of one or more certificates that represented shares of Company Capital Stock
converted pursuant to Section 1.6(b) ("Company Stock Certificates"), together
with (i) a letter of transmittal prepared by the Company (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to the Paying Agent) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (a

Stockholder, the Paying Agent shall pay to such Stockholder, in exchange for
such Company Stock Certificates, cash in an amount equal to that portion of
the Merger Consideration to which such Stockholder is entitled pursuant to

shall send to each Optionholder any necessary instructions for converting
their Company Vested Options into a portion of the Merger Consideration in

(c) Rights Until Surrendered. Until surrendered in accordance with this
Section 1.8, each outstanding Company Stock Certificate and each Company
Vested Option will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(b).

  

  

(d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.8, neither the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any Party shall
be liable to a Stockholder or an Optionholder for any amount properly paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

  

  

(e) Withholding Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries and, on their
respective behalf, Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger
Consideration otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Stockholder or any Optionholder such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement of a
Governmental Entity. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  

  

(f) No Further Ownership Rights. The portion of the Merger Consideration paid
in respect of the conversion of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Vested Options and the deposit of the related pro rata Escrow Amount into the
Escrow Fund and the related pro rata Expense Amount into the Expense Fund in
accordance with the terms hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, shall
be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock and such Company Vested Options (as the case may be),
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates or agreements representing Company Vested
Options are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and converted as provided in this Section 1.8.

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

  

  

(i) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to the record holder of such Company
Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Capital Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i), upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by such record holder.

  

  

(ii) In the event any agreement representing Company Vested Options shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the

making of an affidavit of that fact by such holder.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of any such Merger Consideration pursuant
to the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), require the holder to provide an
indemnification agreement with respect to the lost certificate (in form and
substance included in the Letter of Transmittal or such other form as may be
reasonably acceptable to Parent), against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to a
Company Stock Certificate or agreement representing Company Vested Options.

  

  

1.9 Rounding Adjustments. The aggregate amount of cash into which all shares
of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder are convertible pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and the aggregate amount of cash for which all Company Vested
Options held by an Optionholder are convertible pursuant to Section 1.6(b)
shall be subject to rounding by the Company to the nearest one cent, in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Payment Spreadsheet, in order
that the aggregate amount of cash into which all Company Capital Stock is
convertible and for which all Company Vested Options are exercisable shall, in
the aggregate, equal the Merger Consideration. In addition, the amount of
Merger Consideration paid to, and the amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund and
the Expense Fund on behalf of, a Stockholder and a holder of Company Vested
Options pursuant to Section 1.8 shall be subject to rounding by the Company to
the nearest one cent, in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Payment Spreadsheet in order that the amounts of cash deposited pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement on behalf of all Stockholders and all holders of Company
Vested Options shall result in (a) an aggregate amount equal to $25,000,000.00
being deposited in the Escrow Fund and (b) an aggregate amount of $150,000.00
being deposited in the Expense Fund.

purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) The Company owns no real property, nor has the Company ever owned any real
property. Section 2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company
or otherwise used or occupied by the Company for the operation of its business
(the "Leased Real Property"), and, for each parcel of Leased Real Property,
the name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor or lessee, the date
and term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right and each
amendment thereto and, with respect to any current lease, license, sublease or
other occupancy right the aggregate annual rental payable thereunder.

  

  

(b) The Company has provided Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
lease guaranties, subleases, and Contracts for the leasing, use or occupancy
of, or otherwise granting a right in or relating to each Leased Real Property,
including all amendments, terminations and modifications thereof that are
currently in effect ("Lease Agreements"). All of the Lease Agreements are
valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms. There is not,
under any of the Lease Agreements, any existing event of default (or event
which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) on
the part of the Company, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto. The Company has received no notice of a default, alleged failure to
perform, or any offset or counterclaim with respect to any Lease Agreement,
which has not been fully remedied and withdrawn. The Closing will not affect
the Company's continued use and possession of the Leased Real Property for the
conduct of business in the Ordinary Course. The Company enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession, in all material respects, under each of the Lease
Agreements. There are no other parties occupying, or with a right to occupy,
any Leased Real Property. The Company owes no brokerage commissions or finders
fees with respect to any Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if
any existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair, free
from structural, physical and mechanical defects, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, is maintained in a manner consistent with standards generally
followed with respect to similar properties, and is otherwise suitable for the
conduct of the business of the Company in the Ordinary Course. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the operation of the Company on each Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, does not violate in any material
respect any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating
to such Leased Real Property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation
is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

  

  

(d) The Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, free and clear of any Liens
(other than a Permitted Lien), except as reflected in the Current Balance
Sheet.

  

  

(e) Section 2.15(e) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each item of equipment
owned or leased by the Company having a fair market value of more than $1,000,
and such equipment is (i) adequate for the conduct of the business of the
Company in the Ordinary Course, and (ii) in good operating condition,
regularly and properly maintained, subject to normal wear and tear.

and records relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Books and
Records") for a period of five years in accordance with Parent's document
retention policies and procedures and shall make the Books and Records

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. The Company shall prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Returns of or which include
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (after giving
effect to any valid extension of time in which to make such filing) on or
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) all
Taxes shown due with respect to such Returns. Parent shall be responsible for
the preparation and filing of all Returns with respect to Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Effective Time.

Return that includes a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Effective Time within 30 days of filing such return. If the Stockholders'
Representative determines that any Return should have been prepared
differently, the Stockholders' Representative may so inform the Company. If
the Company agrees, it will amend such Return. If the Company disagrees, and
the Parties cannot resolve their differences, then the Parties shall engage a
nationally recognized accounting firm to make a final determination of whether
or not the Return should be amended. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by the Parties.

  

  

(c) Tax Proceedings.

  

  

(i) Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative in
reasonable detail of the receipt from a Taxing authority of any notice of the
commencement of any Tax audit, examination or judicial or administrative
proceeding or receipt from a Taxing authority of any proposed adjustment,
demand or notice of deficiency which if determined adversely to the relevant
taxpayer or after the lapse of time could be grounds for payment of Losses by
the Stockholders under Article VI (each, a "Tax Proceeding").

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
the limitations in this paragraph, with respect to any Tax Proceeding, (A)
Parent shall at Parent's expense (x) control and direct such Tax Proceeding
through representatives of its own choosing and (y) keep the Stockholders'
Representative reasonably and promptly informed of any significant
developments in such Tax Proceeding; (B) to the extent reasonably required,
the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly execute or cause to be
executed by the relevant taxpayer reasonable powers of attorney or other
documents authorizing such representatives of the Party controlling such Tax
Proceeding to act in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and (C) Parent shall
not pay or compromise any Tax liability asserted in such Tax Proceeding for
which indemnification is available hereunder without the Stockholders'
Representative prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (provided that Parent has exhausted commercially
reasonable avenues to eliminate, settle or compromise such Tax liability in a
manner intended to minimize the amount required to be paid from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Article VI). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders'
Representative may, at its election and at its expense, and upon request
submitted to Parent, employ counsel of its own choosing who will be entitled
to (I) receive reasonable advance notice of all meetings and phone conferences
with taxing authorities in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (II)
participate in all such meetings and phone conferences with taxing authorities
in connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (III) review and comment in

any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Taxing authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
hereby agree that, to the extent permissible by applicable Tax law: (i) all
Tax deductions resulting from payments in respect of Company Vested Options
pursuant to this Agreement will be allocated to taxable periods, or portions
thereof, of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing
Date; and (ii) accordingly, the Company and its Subsidiaries will include all
such Tax deductions on their separate Company federal, state, local or foreign
income Tax Returns (as applicable).

  

  

4.7 Access and Investigation. Prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its representatives to, afford
Parent and its advisors, at Parent's expense, with reasonable access, during
regular business hours, to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' personnel,

unreasonably interfere with the operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and is conducted under the supervision of appropriate

Documents, however, no such amendment, repeal or modification shall diminish

entitled to the indemnities sought.

policy of the same level or scope of directors' and officers' liability
insurance as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof for the six-year
period, in each case covering those persons who are covered by the Company's

PAYMENT OF LOSSES; ESCROW

  

  

6.1 Survival.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company and Parent contained in
Article II and Article III of this Agreement, respectively, or in any
certificate or other instruments delivered at the Closing pursuant to this
Agreement, shall survive until June 29, 2012; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.2(a) (Company Capital
Structure), Section 2.5 (Authority), Section 2.6 (No Conflicts), Section 2.13
(Tax Matters) and Sub-Sections 2.24(d)(ix), (k), (l)(i) and (l)(ii) (Employee
Benefits) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations at which point
they shall expire.

  

  

(b) The covenants and other agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms.

  

  

6.2 Payment of Losses of Parent Damaged Parties. Upon the Closing, subject to
the other provisions of this Article VI, Parent and its officers, directors,
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), employees, agents and
representatives (each, a "Parent Damaged Party" and collectively, the "Parent
Damaged Parties") shall be entitled to payment from the Escrow Fund from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, interest, awards, amounts
paid in settlement, judgments, penalties, and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses and including any such expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, remediating, defending against or
settling any of the foregoing (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and
collectively "Losses"), asserted, incurred or sustained, or may be asserted,
incurred or sustained, by the Parent Damaged Parties, or any of them, arising
out of, related to, or resulting from or based upon (a) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any Contract, certificate or instrument of the Company
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (b) any failure by the Company to
perform or comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in this
Agreement; (c) any error in any of the Spreadsheets; (d) any action taken or
not taken by the Stockholders' Representative with respect to this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, to the extent such action or inaction results in a
claim against a Parent Damaged Party by a Stockholder or an Optionholder; and
(e) any Tax of the Company for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (each such
taxable period, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), excluding any tax accrued as a
liability on the Current Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Section 6.2, in
the case of any period that begins during the Pre-Closing Tax Period and ends
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts of the Company for a Straddle Period which
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass through
entity in which such Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period. Subject to Sections 6.6 and 6.7(b), no Stockholder,
Optionholder, director or officer of the Company shall have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by a Parent Damaged
Party.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.3 Indemnification of Stockholder Indemnified Parties. Upon the Closing,
subject to the other provisions of this Article VII, the Stockholders and the
Vested Optionholders and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
and the officers, directors, managers, members, partners, stockholders and
Affiliates (excluding the Surviving Corporation, "Stockholder Indemnified
Parties") shall be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless by Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, from and against, and to be
reimbursed by Parent and the Surviving Corporation for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties, or any of them,
directly or indirectly, arising out of, related to, or resulting from or based
upon (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any Contract, certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in any Contract,
certificate or instrument of Parent or Merger Sub delivered pursuant to this
Agreement; or (b) any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply
with any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement.

  

  

    

  |  

6.4

  |  

Third Party Claims.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (the "Third Party Claim") in respect of which any Party may
have an obligation pursuant to this Article VI to pay for the Losses of
another Party, the Party asserting such right to payment for incurred Losses
(the "Damaged Party") shall give the Party from whom such right is sought (the
"Responsible Party") written notice thereof as promptly as possible, but any
failure to so notify the Responsible Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Damaged Party other than to the extent the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Stockholders' Representative shall serve as the Responsible
Party with respect to any assertion by a Parent Damaged Party of a right to
payment for incurred Losses and, at the request of a Stockholder Indemnified
Party asserting a right to payment for incurred Loss, the Stockholders'
Representative may assume and perform some or all of the rights and
responsibilities of a Damaged Party that otherwise would be attributable to
such Stockholder Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) The Responsible Party may assume control of the defense of the Damaged
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Damaged Party if:

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) within 15 days after receipt of such written notice, the Responsible Party
confirms in writing that the Responsible Party will defend the Damaged Party
from and against the Losses the Damaged Party may incur as a result of or
arising out of the Third Party Claim (which confirmation shall not be deemed
an admission that indemnification is required pursuant to this Article VI);

  

  

(ii) the Responsible Party provides the Damaged Party with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Damaged Party that the Responsible Party has the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and to fulfill its
obligations to pay for Losses hereunder with respect to all Losses that are
reasonably likely to result from or arise out of the Third Party Claim;

  

  

(iii) the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Damaged
Party (in the case of Parent, acting reasonably through its Board of
Directors), reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the Damaged Party's
reputation or its relationships with its employees, stockholders, or any of
its significant customers or business partners;

  

  

(iv) the Third Party Claim does not seek an order, injunction, non-monetary or
other equitable relief against the Damaged Party which the Damaged Party (in
the case of Parent, acting reasonably through its Board of Directors)
determines reasonably and in good faith could, if successful, have a Material
Adverse Effect; and

  

  

(v) the Responsible Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently and keeps the Damaged Party informed of material
developments with respect to the Third Party Claim and consults with the
Damaged Party prior to making material strategic decisions with respect to the
defense of the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(c) So long as the Responsible Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim and the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b) hereof are being
met:

  

  

(i) the Damaged Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of
such claim; provided, however, that the employment of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Responsible Party if the Damaged Party determines in good
faith that such participation is appropriate in light of conflicts of
interest;

  

  

(ii) the Responsible Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Damaged Party before agreeing to the entry of any judgment arising from such
claim, entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend against
such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) provided, however, that the Responsible Party shall not require such
prior written approval if such settlement or judgment (A) includes as an
unconditional term thereof be given by each claimant or plaintiff to each
Damaged Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim and (B)
involves only the payment of money damages that are covered in full by the
payment obligations of the Responsible Party; and

  

  

(iii) the Responsible Party shall not be liable to such Damaged Party
hereunder for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Damaged Party
in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that the Responsible Party shall be liable
for such legal expenses if the Damaged Party determines in good faith that the
incurrence of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available to
the Responsible Party, or in light of conflicts of interest.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b) above becomes
unsatisfied, the Damaged Party shall, after reasonable written notice to the
Responsible Party, have the right to defend such claim in such manner as it
may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the Responsible Party;
provided that the Damaged Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Responsible Party before agreeing to the entry of any judgment arising from
such claim, entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend
against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and the Responsible Party will promptly reimburse the
Damaged Party to the extent the Damaged Party is entitled to payment of Losses
hereunder, provided that, in the event that the Damaged Party is a Parent
Damaged Party, such Losses shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

(e) A claim for payment of Losses for any matter not involving a third-party
claim shall be asserted by the Damaged Party to the Responsible Party in
writing as promptly as possible, setting forth specifically the obligation
with respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to and the
alleged basis for such claim (to the extent known) and, if known, the amount
of the Losses asserted or which may be asserted by reason thereof, but any
failure to so notify the Responsible Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Damaged Party other than to the extent the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Responsible Party
shall be entitled to contest any such claim in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

6.5 Limitations on Payment for Losses.

  

  

(a) Neither the Parent Damaged Parties nor the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
may assert any claim for Losses under Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(e) or 6.3(a), as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of all such claims
equals or exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold"). Thereafter, liability shall be
for the full amount of such Losses without regard to the Threshold. No claims
for individual Losses of less than $50,000 may be asserted at any time or
shall be included in determining whether the Threshold has been met; provided,
however, the foregoing clause shall not apply to Losses under Sections 6.2(b),
6.2(c), 6.2(d) or 6.3(b). After the Closing, subject to Sections 6.6 and
6.7(b), claims against the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of
this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with
regard to any Loss arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) No Damaged Party shall be entitled to recover consequential, incidental,
punitive, exemplary or other special Losses, or Losses based on a multiplier
or lost profits, with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
or non-performance of any obligation under this Agreement (or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby), and under no circumstances
shall such damages be considered "Losses" under this Agreement; provided,
however, Losses shall include such consequential, incidental, punitive,
exemplary or other special Losses in the event that the Damaged Party is
liable to a third party for such Losses pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to
claims for Losses pursuant to this Article VI, in the event it is determined
either by mutual agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Damaged Party is not entitled to payment for Losses hereunder, Damaged Party
shall promptly reimburse all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the
Responsible Party in defense of such claim.

  

  

6.6 Fundamental Representations. Subject to the other provisions of this
Article VI, a Parent Damaged Party shall be entitled to payment for Losses,
incurred or sustained by such Parent Damaged Party arising out of, related to,
or resulting from or based upon any breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental
Representation as follows:

  

  

(a) first, the Parent Damaged Party will be required to make claims against
the Escrow Fund rather than against the Stockholders and the Vested
Optionholders (collectively, the "Escrow Fund Participants") individually,
until the funds contained in the Escrow Fund have been fully exhausted or
distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (except for Losses arising
from the breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental Representation made solely with
respect to a specific Escrow Fund Participant which shall be allocated solely
to such Escrow Fund Participant);

  

  

(b) then, allocated pro rata and severally among the Escrow Fund Participants
according to the portion of the Merger Consideration paid to such Escrow Fund
Participant (except for Losses arising from the breach or inaccuracy of a
Fundamental Representation made solely with respect to a specific Escrow Fund
Participant which shall be allocated solely to such Escrow Fund Participant).

  

  

(c) In no event will the aggregate liability of any Escrow Fund Participant
under this Agreement exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration received
by such Escrow Fund Participant pursuant to this Agreement.

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, the Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement,
and Merger Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent (i) the Escrow Amount, such
deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund")
to satisfy the payment obligations provided for in Section 6.2, and (ii) the
Expense Amount, such deposit of the Expense Amount to constitute a fund for
use of the Stockholders' Representative to pay the costs, expenses and
liabilities incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in accordance with
Section 6.9 (the "Expense Fund"). The Escrow Amount shall be available to
compensate the Parent Damaged Parties for any claims by such Parties for any
Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to
recovery under this Article VI for a period beginning on the date hereof and
ending June 29, 2012 (the "Escrow Period"). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, but subject to Sections 6.6 and 6.7(b), the right of Parent's
Indemnified Parties to seek compensation shall be limited solely and
exclusively to the Escrow Fund and no current or former stockholder, director,
officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company shall have any liability of any nature to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of either Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any breach by the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If any claims for payment of Losses have been made pursuant to this
Article VI and the same are still pending or unresolved at the expiration of
the Escrow Period, such claims will continue to be subject to the provisions
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any Person
(and such Person's pro rata share of the Escrow Fund shall not be the
exclusive remedy) in respect of Losses arising out of common law fraud
committed by such Person.

6.8

  |  

Mitigation; Insurance.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation under this Article VI, Parent shall take and cause
its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with the Stockholders' Representative, if
so requested, in order to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the
consequences of the related breach (including taking reasonable measures to
prevent any contingent liability from becoming an actual liability).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Damaged
Parties' Loss shall be limited to the amount of Losses incurred by such
Damaged Parties, net of insurance recoveries actually received by such Damaged
Parties as a result of such Losses and indemnification payments actually
received by such Damaged Parties with respect to such Losses and tax benefits
actually received by such Damaged Parties with respect to such Losses.

this Agreement to paragraph, subparagraph, section, subsection, clause and
subclause are intended to refer to paragraphs, subparagraphs, sections,
subsections, clauses and subclauses, respectively, of this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that titles and headings for particular
paragraphs, sections and subsections of this Agreement have been inserted
solely for reference purposes. As a result, section and paragraph headings,
titles or captions should not be used to interpret or construe the terms of
this Agreement. Except as to words or phrases specifically defined in this
Agreement, the Parties agree that all words and phrases selected to state the
terms of this Agreement are to be interpreted in accordance with their plain
and generally prevailing meaning and not with regard to any different meaning
that any of the Parties might otherwise attach to a particular word or phrase.

to exclude any item not listed. The Parties further acknowledge that, as a
result of either drafting or negotiating specific terms, or as a result of
approving language selected by others to state specific terms, they are each
and all equally responsible for the wording of the terms of this Agreement. As
a result, the Parties agree and acknowledge that in interpreting this
Agreement, the rule of contractual interpretation and construction that
provides that an ambiguity in the terms of an agreement shall be construed
against the Party drafting such term does not apply to the interpretation or
construction of the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

7.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. This Agreement

deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary,
either by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Parties, to render the same
valid and enforceable, or shall be deemed excised from this Agreement, as the
case may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced to the
maximum extend permitted by law, as if such provision had been originally
incorporated in this Agreement as so modified or restricted, or as if such
provision had not been originally incorporated in this Agreement, as the case

7.10 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right privilege or remedy;
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

provision of this Agreement will cause the other Parties irreparable harm and
that such other Parties will be entitled to equitable relief, without the
necessity of posting a bond, including specific performance, an injunction, a
restraining order and/or other equitable relief in order to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, which right is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other remedy to which such Party is entitled under law (including
