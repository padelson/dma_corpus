receipt of the Closing Statement, Buyer shall be permitted to review Sellers
books and working papers related to the preparation of the Closing Statement
and determination of the amounts therein. The Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties sixty (60) days following Buyers receipt
thereof, unless Buyer shall give written notice of its disagreement (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount
of any disagreement so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is
received by Seller, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
clause (x) or (y) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on
the earliest of (x) the date the parties resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
or (y) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing
pursuant to _Section 9.11_. During the twenty (20) days following delivery

the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. Following delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, Seller and its agents and representatives shall be
permitted to review Buyers and its representatives working papers relating

to above, the matters in dispute have not been fully resolved, then the
parties shall submit the matter for arbitration under _Section 9.11_ (with
only such matters that remain in dispute being subject to the arbitration).
In resolving any matters in dispute, the arbitrator may not assign a value to
any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller,
on the other hand. The arbitrators determination will be based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review).

  



  

(c) _Statement Payment_. If the Statement Payment Amount determined pursuant
to _Section 2.3(c)_ is positive (meaning that the sum of Closing
Indebtedness _plus_ the Closing CAL _plus_ the Statement CSL is greater than

Closing Statement is finalized Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash
equal to the Statement Payment Amount. If the Statement Payment Amount
determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ is negative (meaning that the sum of
Closing Indebtedness _plus_ the Closing CAL _plus_  the Statement CSL is less
than the amount of Statement Cash Addback), then within ten (10) days after
the Closing Statement is finalized Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in
cash equal to the absolute value of the Statement Payment Amount.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) _Pre-Closing Receivables_. Any amounts received by Buyer or
its Affiliates with respect to the Unpaid Receivables shall be promptly paid
over to Seller by Buyer in cash (without any reduction or offset). Buyer
hereby agrees to use (and to cause its Affiliates to use) reasonable
commercial efforts to collect all Pre-Closing Receivables and will, in any
event, use at least as great of efforts to collect them as Buyer uses to
collect its own receivables. Buyer shall not be required to commence
legal proceedings in order to collect Pre-Closing Receivables. Buyer hereby
agrees not to settle or compromise any Pre-Closing Receivable, or permit it
to be settled, for less than its full amount (including by way of any credit,
rebate, setoff or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Seller. If
requested by Seller at any time, Buyer shall allow Seller to seek collection
of the Pre-Closing Receivables on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in such manner as Seller shall reasonably determine and Buyer shall provide
Seller access to, and copies of (at Sellers expense) relevant invoices and
documentation in such efforts if and to the extent requested by Seller.
Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs actually
incurred by Buyer in collecting Pre-Closing Receivables; provided, that Buyer
shall not incur any such costs without getting the prior written approval of
Seller to do so (and, if the Seller wishes, shall allow Seller to collect
them instead) **.**

days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement
(in its final and binding form as determined below, the " _Headquarter
Statement_ ") setting forth the amount of the Covered Headquarter
Liabilities, if any. The Headquarter Statement shall include any adjustments
required by _Section 2.3(h)_, if any. During the 30-day period immediately
following Sellers receipt of the Headquarter Statement, Seller shall be
permitted to review Buyers books and working papers related to the
preparation of the Headquarter Statement and determination of the amounts
therein.  The Headquarter Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt thereof, unless
Seller shall give a Notice of Disagreement to Buyer prior to such date. Any
Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and
dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted. If a timely Notice
of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the Headquarter Statement (as
revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the earliest of (x) the date the
parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date all matters
in dispute are finally resolved in writing pursuant to _Section 9.11_.
During the twenty (20) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Buyer and Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. Following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer
and its agents and representatives shall be permitted to review Sellers and
its representatives working papers relating to the Notice of Disagreement.
If, at the end of the 20-day period referred to above, the matters in dispute
have not been fully resolved, then the parties shall submit the matter for
arbitration under _Section 9.11_ (with only such matters that remain in
dispute being subject to the arbitration). In resolving any matters in
dispute, the arbitrator may not assign a value to any item in dispute greater
than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or
Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand.
The arbitrators determination will be based solely on presentations by Buyer
and Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review).
Within ten (10) days

shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Covered Headquarter
Liability.

  



  

(f) _Pre-Closing Receivables_. If after the Closing Statement Date any amount
of Cash Addback arises under clause (iii) of the definition thereof, then

cash over to Seller (without any reduction or offset).

  



  

(g) _Other Covered Special Liabilities_. If any Covered Special Liabilities
arise after the Closing Statement Date, such amounts shall be addressed
solely by indemnification as provided in _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_.

  



  

(h) _Adjustment to Amounts Payable_. With respect to any amount payable
after Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, the parties shall
make appropriate adjustments for tax benefits actually realized (such as
deductions available to Buyer or its Affiliates due to the severance included
in the Covered Headquarter Liability), and insurance coverage actually
received. In the event that any such tax benefit or insurance proceeds are
realized subsequent to the payment hereunder in respect of such matter,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly regarding the amount of such
payment.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING**

  

 **THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND THE SELLER**

  



  

As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer that as of the Closing Date:

  



  

5.1 _Corporate Organization_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its State
of incorporation and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in
which its ownership of property or conduct of business requires it to
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.2 _Capital Stock and Related Matters; Title to Shares_. All shares of the
Capital Stock of the Company are held beneficially and of record by the
Seller, free and clear of all Encumbrances. All shares of Capital Stock of
the Company Subsidiaries are held beneficially and of record by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of all Encumbrances. Neither the
Company, nor the Company Subsidiaries, have outstanding any stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable for any shares of its Capital Stock or
containing any profit participation features, nor any rights or options to
subscribe for or to purchase its capital stock or any stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its Capital Stock or any stock
appreciation rights or phantom stock plan.

  



  

5.3 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

  



  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all of the
other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which Seller or
the Company is a party have been duly authorized by the Seller and the
Company, and no other act (corporate or otherwise) or other proceeding on the
part of Seller, its shareholders, or the Company is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller and the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Seller and the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms
(except as enforceability may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, winding-up or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights and by general principles of equity), and each of the other
agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which Seller or the Company
is a party, when executed and delivered by Seller or the Company in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, shall each constitute a valid
and binding obligation of Seller or the Company, as applicable, enforceable
in accordance with its respective terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and by
general principles of equity). The assignments, endorsements, stock powers
and other instruments of transfer delivered by

  



        
   

  



  

Seller to Buyer at the Closing will be sufficient to transfer the Sellers
entire interest, legal and beneficial, in the Shares.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and all of the
other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which Seller is
a party and the fulfillment of and compliance with the respective terms
hereof and thereof by Seller do not and shall not (i) conflict with or result

to, (iv) give any third party the right to modify, terminate or accelerate
any obligation under, (v) result in a violation of, or (vi) require

or administrative or governmental body or agency pursuant to the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries charter documents, bylaws or other constituent
documents, or any law, statute, rule or regulation to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Seller is subject, or any material agreement,
instrument, license, permit, order, judgment or decree to which the Company
or Seller is subject; provided, that Seller makes no such representation as
to whether change-of-control consents are required under store leases or
other contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than a contractual
obligation that would prohibit the sale of the Shares or completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

5.4 _Subsidiaries_. The attached _Subsidiary Schedule_  correctly sets forth

organization and the Persons owning the outstanding Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and possesses
all requisite corporate power and corporate authority necessary to own its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and is
qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of
property or the conduct of business requires it to qualify, except where the

warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or (ii)
any liability or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries other than
the Covered Liabilities (including any such liabilities or

  



        
   

  



  

obligations under the Services Agreement); provided, that, with respect to
Split-Cost Losses, the Buyer shall only be required to indemnify Seller Group
Members for fifty percent (50%) of such Split-Cost Losses.

  



  

(c) _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification of the Seller Group Members
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Buyer to an account designated by the
applicable Seller Group Member, as the case may be, within ten (10)
days after the determination thereof. Any such indemnification payments
shall include interest at the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over 360, from the date any such Loss is
suffered or sustained to the date of payment. In addition, the aggregate
cumulative amount for claims arising under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ relating to a
breach of a representation or warranty shall not exceed one million dollars
($1,000,000), and the Seller Group Members shall have no right to recover any
amounts in excess of such amount in any respect). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a breach of _Sections 6.1_ (Organization and Power), _6.2_
(Authority), _6.8_  (Investment) or _6.9_ (No other Representations. As-Is
Nature of Transaction) shall not be subject to the foregoing $1,000,000
limitation. Any indemnification of the Buyer Parties pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ shall be made solely as provided in _Section 8.2(g)_.

  



  

(d) _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 8.2_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify
the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing
promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party),
describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the
basis thereof; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent
that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnitor has been materially
prejudiced thereby. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim
giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors
expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations set forth below) shall
be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a nationally
recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to
be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ , that, prior
to the Indemnitor assuming control of such defense it shall first (i)
verify to the Indemnitee in writing that such Indemnitor shall be fully
responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all liabilities and
obligations relating to such claim for indemnification and that (without
regard to any dollar or source limitations otherwise set forth herein) it
shall provide full indemnification (whether or not otherwise required
hereunder) to the Indemnitee with respect to such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to such claim for
indemnification hereunder and (ii) enter into an agreement with the
Indemnitee in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee which
agreement unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of any
liability or obligation which may arise with respect to such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that:

  



  

(i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by
the Indemnitee (other than any fees and expenses of such separate counsel
that are incurred prior to the date

  



        
   

  



  

the Indemnitor effectively assumes control of such defense which,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnitor, and except
that the Indemnitor shall pay all of the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel if the Indemnitee has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee);

  



  

(ii) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnitee) and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee if (1) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
quasi-criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
(2) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee;
(3) the Indemnitee has been advised by counsel of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee; or (4) upon petition by the
Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnitor failed or is
failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim;

  



  

(iii) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim,
the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such
claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee
or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim,
without prejudice; and

  



  

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
control the defense and/or settlement of all Covered Special
Liabilities (including the Existing Litigation), in whatever manner and to
whatever extent Seller sees fit (including by whatever counsel it wishes),
without any obligation to consult with, inform or obtain any consent of any
Buyer Party with respect to any matter involving such Covered Special
Liabilities; provided, that if any such settlement involves an injunction or
other prohibition that limits or affects how the Buyer may operate the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the future, such settlement
shall also require the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(e) _Direct Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
claim by an Indemnitee for indemnification not involving a third party claim
may be asserted by giving the Indemnitor written notice thereof. If the
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) calendar days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnitor disputes its
liability to the Indemnitee, such claim specified by the Indemnitee in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed an obligation of the Indemnitor
hereunder, and the Indemnitor will pay the amount of such Losses to the
Indemnitee on demand (subject in all respects to _Section 8.2(g)_). Any
disputes with respect to any claim under this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall be
resolved by arbitration in the manner provided in _Section 9.11_ below.

  



         
 

  



  

(f) _Effect of Investigation_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no investigation or knowledge of any party, whenever undertaken or
however obtained, shall limit such partys right to indemnification hereunder
in any manner.

  



  

(g) _Recovery from Services Agreement; Limits on Recovery_. For so long as
Buyer Parties or their Affiliates have any outstanding obligation owed to
Seller, Buyer Parties shall first offset Sellers liability under _Section
8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.8_, in each case by reducing any amounts due and owing
to Seller by Buyer Parties or their Affiliates, including, without
limitation, amounts payable to Seller under the Services Agreement. In
the event that Buyer Parties and their Affiliates have no payables or
debt obligations owed to Seller or the liability owed to Buyer Parties under
this Section 8.2 exceeds the amount Buyer Parties and their Affiliates then
owe to Seller, any indemnification of the Buyer Parties pursuant to this
_Sections 8.2 or 8.8_  shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from Seller to an account designated by the applicable Buyer
Party, as the case may be, within ten (10) days after the determination
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict any of the Buyer Parties right to maintain or recover any
amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud. In addition,
the aggregate cumulative amount for claims arising under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
relating to a breach of a representation or warranty (including by reducing
any amounts due and owing to Seller by Buyer Parties or their Affiliates)
shall not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), and the Buyer Parties
shall have no right to recover any amounts in excess of such amount in any
respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a breach of _Sections 5.1_ (Corporate
Organization), _5.2_ (Capital Stock and Related Matters; Title to Shares),
_5.3(a)_ (Authorization; Noncontravention), _5.4_ (Subsidiaries) or _5.9_
(Taxes) shall not be subject to the foregoing $1,000,000 limitation.  Any
indemnification payments pursuant to this provision shall include interest at
the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over 360, from the date any such Loss is suffered or sustained to the
date of payment. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that
indemnification for Covered Special Liabilities under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_
is not subject to the foregoing $1,000,000 limitation.

  



  

(h) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, and except as
expressly provided in _Section 2.3_, the indemnification provided in this
_Section 8.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to any party
for all monetary claims relating to this Agreement against the Seller or its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to a Closing) or
against the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after a Closing), in each case other than for fraud.

  



  

(i) _Certain Adjustments_. With respect to any claim for indemnification
under this _Section 8.2_, the parties shall make appropriate adjustments for
tax benefits actually realized and insurance coverage actually received. In
the event that any such tax benefit or insurance proceeds are realized
subsequent to the receipt by the indemnified party of an indemnification
payment hereunder (including by offset against amounts payable by Buyer under
the Services Agreement) in respect of such claim to which such tax benefit or
insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly
regarding the amount of such indemnification payment.

  



  

8.3 _Mutual Assistance_. Buyer and the Seller Parties agree that they will
mutually cooperate in the expeditious filing of all notices, reports and
other filings with any federal, state,

  



        
   

  



  

local or foreign governmental authority required to be submitted jointly by
such Persons in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and/or the other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

8.4 _Press Release and Announcements_. Unless required by law (in which case
each of the Buyer and Seller agree to use reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party prior to any such disclosure as to the form and content of
such disclosure), after the date hereof and through and including the Closing
Date, no press releases, announcements to the employees, customers or
suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other releases of
information related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
will be issued or released without the consent of Buyer and Seller; provided,
that (i) the Seller may issue a press release announcing this transaction
following the execution of this Agreement in substantially the form
previously provided by Seller (the " _Initial Release_ "), and may thereafter
discuss and distribute the contents of such Initial Release and other
information about the transactions contemplated herein as it deems reasonably
necessary in the course of its business, and (ii) following the issuance of
the Initial Release the Buyer may issue its own press release announcing this
transaction, in form agreed by the Buyer and the Seller, acting reasonably,
and may thereafter discuss and distribute the contents of such press release
and other information about the transactions contemplated herein reasonably
necessary in the course of their relations with shareholders, employees,
customers and suppliers.  After the Closing, either party may issue any such
releases of information without the consent of any other party hereto.

  



  

8.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, Seller and Buyer shall
pay all of their own and all of their Affiliates fees, costs and expenses
(including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants and appraisal fees,
costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

8.6 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions
of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
is otherwise breached.  Accordingly, each party agrees that the other parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court in the
United States or in any state having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled pursuant
hereto.

  



  

8.7 _Further Assurances_. In the event that at any time after the Closing
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will take such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other party hereto reasonably may request. Seller Parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, Buyer will be
entitled to possession of, and Seller Parties shall deliver to Buyer, all
documents, books, records (including Tax records), agreements and financial
data of any sort relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



        
   

  



  

8.8 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Buyer and the Seller for certain tax matters
following the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. The Seller shall indemnify the Company, its
Subsidiaries, and Buyer Parties and hold them harmless from and against
(without duplication), any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage
attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation and (iii) any
and all Taxes of any person (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed
on Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to
an event or transaction occurring before the Closing.

  



  

(b) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Seller shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date including but not limited
to income Tax returns for the Affiliated Group of which Seller, Company and
its Subsidiaries are Members. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with past practice to the extent allowable by law insofar as they
relate to the Company (subject to effects thereon from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including adjustments to the basis of assets
in connection with worthless stock deductions). Seller shall provide Buyer
with at least 15 days to review and comment on any such income Tax Returns
prepared by Seller (which in the case of consolidated returns shall only
apply to the pro-forma portion thereof that relates to the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and shall discuss any disagreements with Buyer in good faith.
If Seller then files the income Tax Return without accepting one or more
comments from Buyer, Buyer shall have up to 30 days after it becomes aware of
such filing to submit a formal objection and request for arbitration under
Section 9.11 below (in which case the arbitration shall address only the
disputed income Tax position and whether such position violates this
Agreement, as neither the Seller nor the arbitrator shall have the right to
dictate any revision or amendment to any Tax Return). The Seller shall be
responsible for all Taxes due and payable for periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and shall receive all refunds (including interest and, for
the avoidance of doubt, refunds resulting from or related to worthless stock
deductions that apply in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) due for these periods (and Buyer shall not apply such refunds
to offset amounts for any other period). Buyer shall execute any such tax
returns on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries if requested by Seller.

  



  

(c) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Tax
Returns_ "). Buyer shall provide Seller at least 15 days to review and
comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing. Buyer shall consider any such
comments from

  



        
   

  



  

Seller and shall discuss any disagreements with Seller in good faith. If
Buyer then files the Tax Return without accepting one or more comments from
Seller, Seller shall have up to 30 days after it becomes aware of such filing
to submit a formal objection and request for arbitration under Section 9.11
below (in which case the arbitration shall address only the disputed Tax
position and whether such position violates this Agreement, as neither the
Seller nor the arbitrator shall have the right to dictate any revision or
amendment to any Tax Return). Any portion of any Tax which must be paid in
connection with the filing of a Straddle Tax Return, to the extent
attributable to the portion of the period ending on or before the Closing
Date, shall be referred to herein as " _Pre-Closing Straddle_ _Taxes_." The
Seller shall pay to Buyer (or to the applicable Taxing authority) an amount
equal to the Pre-Closing Straddle Taxes due with any Straddle Tax Returns at
least ten (10) days before Buyer is required to cause to be paid the related
Tax liability (unless Seller pays the Tax liability, in which case Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for Buyers applicable portion promptly upon request
by Seller). Pre-Closing Straddle Taxes shall be calculated as though the
taxable year of the Company terminated as of the close of business on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a tax not based on
income, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items, Pre-Closing Straddle
Taxes shall be equal to the amount of tax for the taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the
beginning of the taxable period through the Closing Date and the denominator
of which shall be the number of days in the taxable period. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.  Seller
shall receive all refunds (including interest) due for the periods prior to
Closing (and Buyer shall not apply such refunds to offset amounts for any
other period). Further, Buyer shall not take any Tax position (or amend and
prior filings) after Closing (including for periods that are solely with
respect to post-Closing periods) that would have the effect of increasing the
Tax payable by Seller with respect to any period prior to Closing, or that
Seller reasonably believes is otherwise contrary to the interests of Seller
or that would require Seller to amend any of its own prior Tax Returns.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The parties shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 8.8_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include signing any Tax Return, amended Tax Returns, claims or other
documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy, the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to provide the other party with
all information that either Party may be required to report pursuant to Code
§6043 and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Seller shall
control (and have the right to settle and resolve) all tax audits occurring
after Closing with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case
to the extent the periods under audit are periods ending on or prior to
Closing. Seller shall not settle any audit of a Seller Tax Return to the
extent that such return relates to Company and its Subsidiaries in a manner
that would adversely affect Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall control (and have the right to settle and
resolve) all Tax audits of the Company and its subsidiaries of Straddle Tax
Returns or periods that would have

  



        
   

  



  

been covered by a Straddle Tax Return if filed; provided, that Buyer shall
not take any Tax position in any audit, or settle any matter in an audit,
that would have the effect of increasing the Tax payable by Seller with
respect to any period prior to Closing, or that Seller reasonably believes is
otherwise contrary to the interests of Seller or that would require Seller to
amend any of its own prior Tax Returns, in each case without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Buyer shall keep Seller fully informed regarding any such audits and shall
permit Seller reasonable review, and shall consult in good faith with Seller
regarding and permit Seller to dispute audit positions and adjustments (with
the right to arbitrate the same if Seller believes the position or adjustment
violates this Agreement), any such audit matters.

  



  

(e) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer will, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Taxes, fees and charges.

  



  

(f) _Source of Payments_. In any case where any Seller Party is required to
pay any amount under this _Section 8.8_, such amounts shall be paid (and
Buyer Parties shall have recourse) only by reducing amounts payable to Seller
under the Services Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.2(g)_ above.

  



  

8.9 _Satisfaction of Obligations and Liabilities_. From and after Closing
Buyer shall perform and satisfy all obligations and liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including under all operating and capital
leases), of whatever nature and whenever arising. The foregoing shall not
limit (i) the Buyers right to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_
with respect to Covered Special Liabilities, or (ii) the Sellers right
to indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ with respect to all other
liabilities.

9.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement and all of the covenants and
agreements contained herein and rights, interests or obligations hereunder,
by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto, shall bind and inure to the
benefit of the respective heirs, successors and assigns of the parties hereto
whether so expressed or not; _provided_ , that neither this Agreement nor any
of the covenants and agreements herein or rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any party without the prior written
consent of the other parties.

  



        
   

  



  

9.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

9.5 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this Agreement, in
any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, in the table of contents or in any index
hereto are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way
affect any provision of this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, and
all provisions of this Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto shall
be enforced and construed as if no caption or heading had been used herein or
therein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached
hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in
this Agreement. Each defined term used in this Agreement shall have a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form. The use of the
word "including" (or definitions thereof) herein shall mean "including
without limitation" and, unless the context otherwise required, "neither,"
"nor," "any," "either" and "or" shall not be exclusive. The parties hereto
intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall
have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which such
party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that such
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

9.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, such
third parties specifically including employees and creditors of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

9.7 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and documents
referred to herein contain the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way.

  



  

9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including by means of telecopied or electronically
transmitted signature pages), all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  



  

9.9 _Delivery by Facsimile_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine, shall be treated in all manner and

  



        
   

  



  

respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person.

  



  

9.10 _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the
internal law of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Minnesota
or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdictions other than the State of Minnesota.

  



  

9.11 _Arbitration_  . All disputes between the parties relating to (i) this
Agreement; (ii) the transaction contemplated thereby; or (iii) negotiations
leading up to execution of this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect. The arbitrators shall have the power to
award costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, as they deem appropriate.

  



  

9.12 _Name of Subsidiaries_. Within 15 days of the Closing, Buyer shall
cause any Subsidiary of the Company that includes the word "Regis" in its
name to change their name to a name that does not include the word "Regis"
