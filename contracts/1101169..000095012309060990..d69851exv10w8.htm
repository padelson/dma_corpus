Unless otherwise advised by outside counsel to Group, Group shall not file the Registration Statement or any such Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities or the Holders Counsel shall reasonably object in writing within three (3) Business Days of their receipt thereof. 

   

 (ii) (A) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission such additional Registration Statements as necessary in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities; (B) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated under the Securities Act; (C) respond as promptly as possible to any comments received from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and as promptly as possible provide the Holders true and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to the Registration Statement; (D) file the final prospectus pursuant to Rule 424 of the Securities Act; and (E) comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Holders thereof set forth in the Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. 

   

 (iii) Notify the Holders and the Holders Counsel as promptly as possible (and, in the case of (A)(1) below, not less than five (5) days prior to such filing, and in the case of (C) below, on the same day of receipt by Group of such notice from the 

   ##### 

  

   

Commission) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in
writing no later than two (2) Business Days following the day (A)(1) when a
Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement is filed, (2) when the Commission notifies Group
whether there will be a "review" of such Registration Statement and whenever
the Commission comments in writing on such Registration Statement and (3)
with respect to the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment,
when the same has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission or
any other Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional
information; (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement covering any or all
of the Registrable Securities or the initiation or threatening of any
Proceedings for that purpose; (D) of the receipt by Group of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such
purpose; and (E) of the occurrence of any event that makes any statement made
in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect
or that requires any revisions to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
other documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (iv) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the prompt withdrawal of, (A) any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or (B) any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment. 

   

 (v) If requested by the Holders of a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities, (A) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement such information as Group reasonably agrees should be included therein and (B) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after Group has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment. 

   

 (vi) Furnish to each Holder and the Holders Counsel, without charge, at least one (1) conformed copy of each Registration Statement and each amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and all exhibits to the extent requested by such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated by reference) promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission (all of which documents may be furnished in electronic format). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vii) Promptly deliver to each Holder and the Holders Counsel, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and Group hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto. 

   

 (viii) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling Holders and the Holders Counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Holder requests in writing, to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Group shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or subject Group to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. 

   

 (ix) Cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free of all restrictive legends (provided that the issuance of such unlegended certificates is in compliance with applicable securities laws), and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any Holder may request in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities. 

   

 (x) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section 3(a)(iii)(E)_, as promptly as possible, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, neither the Registration Statement nor such Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (xi) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities relating to the Registration Statement to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. 

   

 (xii) Comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and make generally available to its security holders all documents filed or required to be filed with the Commission, including, but not limited,

 5. _Indemnification._  

  

 (a) _Indemnification by Group_.

Group shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which Group is aware in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Annex A. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Indemnification by Holders_. Each Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Group, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls Group (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents and employees of such controlling Persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as incurred, arising solely out of or based solely upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder or other Indemnifying Party to Group specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or such Prospectus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Annex A, each Holder shall be liable under this _Section 5(b)_ for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Holder as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. 

   

 (c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), such Indemnified Party promptly shall notify promptly the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; _provided_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Annex A, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (iii) such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding. 

    ##### 

  

     

 All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable and documented out of pocket fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this _Section 5_) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten (10) Business Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). 

   

 (d) _Contribution_. If a claim for indemnification under _Section 5(a)_ or  _5(b)_ is unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure or refusal of a governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other hand. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault, as applicable, of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5(c)_, any reasonable attorneys or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. In no event shall any selling Holder be required to contribute an amount under this _Section 5(d)_ in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon sale of such Holders Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement giving rise to such contribution obligation. 

   

 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 5(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

   

 The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holders shall be liable under this 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 5(d)_ for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to
such Holder as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement. 

   

 6\. _Rule 144_. During the Effectiveness Period, Group covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by Group after the date hereof pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
