Viasystems SEC Documents, and none of the Viasystems SEC Documents as of such respective dates

of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which Group is aware in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Annex A.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Indemnification by Holders</U>. Each Holder shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless Group, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each Person who
controls Group (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act and Section&nbsp;20 of the
Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents and employees of such controlling Persons, to

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any
Prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder or
other Indemnifying Party to Group specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or such
Prospectus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Annex A, each Holder shall
be liable under this <U>Section&nbsp;5(b)</U> for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds
to such Holder as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings</U>. If any Proceeding shall be brought or
asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;), such
Indemnified Party promptly shall notify promptly the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the
&#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense
thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; <U>provided</U>,
that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Annex A, except (and only) to the extent
that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to
assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (iii)&nbsp;such Indemnified Party shall have been advised
by counsel (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) that a conflict of
interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent. No Indemnifying Party
shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are
the subject matter of such Proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable and documented out of
pocket fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to
defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this <U>Section&nbsp;5</U>) shall be paid to
the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days of written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification hereunder; <U>provided</U>, that the Indemnifying Party may
require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent
it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification

<U>5(b)</U> is unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure or refusal of a
governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of
public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other hand. If, but only if,
the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the
allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault, as
applicable, of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions,
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material
fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable
by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in <U>Section&nbsp;5(c)</U>, any reasonable attorneys&#146; or other reasonable fees or expenses
incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been
indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was
available to such party in accordance with its terms. In no event shall any selling Holder be
required to contribute an amount under this <U>Section&nbsp;5(d)</U> in excess of the net proceeds
received by such Holder upon sale of such Holder&#146;s Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement giving rise to such contribution obligation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this <U>Section&nbsp;5(d)</U> were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any
liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holders shall be liable under this
