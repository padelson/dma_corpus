2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that upon the terms
and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth herein,
at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller, the Membership
Interests, for a purchase price equal to $255,000,000 (the " _Initial Purchase
Price_ "), as such amount shall be adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.3_
(such adjusted amount, the " _Final Purchase Price_ ").

BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS ON, AND
DISCLAIMERS OF, WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 8.8_, ARE A BARGAINED FOR AND
MATERIAL PART OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS.

 

2.2 Reserved.

 

2.3 _Initial Purchase Price Adjustments_.

(a) The Initial Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case
may be, on a dollar for dollar basis as follows:

 

(i) decreased by the amount of Initial Working Capital;

 

(ii) decreased by the amount of cash or cash equivalents of the Company
distributed by the Company from and after the Effective Date until Closing
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include any dividend or other
distribution payable in cash) (the " _Distribution Adjustment_ ");

 

(iii) increased by the amount of cash or cash equivalents contributed to the
Company from and after the Effective Date until Closing by the Companys
parent or any of its Affiliates (the " _Contribution Adjustment"_ );

(iv) increased to the extent that the amount of Net Intercompany Indebtedness
immediately prior to the settlement thereof at Closing is greater than the 

 



\- 11 -   amount of Net Intercompany Indebtedness at the Effective Date, or decreased
to the extent that the amount of Net Intercompany Indebtedness immediately
prior to the settlement thereof at Closing is less than the amount of Net
Intercompany Indebtedness at the Effective Date (the " _Intercompany
Indebtedness Adjustment_ ");

(v) increased or decreased, as applicable, by the adjustments described at
_Schedule 2.3(a)(v)_ attached hereto (the " _Special Adjustments_ ");

 

(vi) increased, by the amount of $1,050,000 as payment for services to be
provided under the Transition Services Agreement (the " _TSA Adjustment_ ");
and

(vii) decreased by the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts in accordance with the procedures in _Exhibit A_
and _Section 2.4_ (collectively the " _Defect Adjustment_ ").

Each Adjustment shall be determined without duplication of any amounts
included in another Adjustment hereunder.

(b) No less than two (2) Business Days before the scheduled Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer in writing its good faith estimate of the
Adjustments as determined as of the Closing Date (the " _Initial Adjustments_
"), together with its calculation of the Initial Adjustments in reasonable
detail (the " _Closing Estimate_ ").

(c) On or before the date that is forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a closing balance sheet of the
Company (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement (a " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth calculations of each of (i) the Distribution
Adjustment, (ii) the Contribution Adjustment, (iii) the Intercompany
Indebtedness Adjustment, (iv) the Special Adjustments, (v) the Defect
Adjustment for Title Defects and Environmental Defects resolved as of the
Closing Date and (vi) the resulting Final Purchase Price (subject to any
unresolved Post-Closing Curable Defects, as defined below), each of which is
to be prepared in accordance with the Companys past accounting practices,
including the calculation of the Initial Working Capital. Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of the Closing Statement
and provide to Buyer such data and information as Buyer may reasonably request
supporting the amounts reflected in the Closing Statement.

(d) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on
the date that is thirty (30) days following delivery thereof by Buyer unless
Seller gives written notice of its bona fide disagreement (" _Dispute Notice_
") to Buyer prior to such date, in which case such Closing Statement (as
revised in accordance with _clause (e)_ below, if applicable) shall become
final and binding on the earlier of (i) the date upon which Seller and Buyer
agree in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Dispute Notice
or (ii) the date upon which any dispute regarding the Closing Statement is
decided by the Referral Firm, as defined in clause (e) below (" _Final
Closing Statement_ "). Any Dispute Notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the item, dollar amount, and basis of any disagreement asserted (" _Disputed
Amounts_ ").

 



\- 12 -  (e)

 

(i) During the thirty (30) days following the date upon which Buyer receives a
Dispute Notice, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to matters specified
in the Dispute Notice. If at the end of such thirty (30) day period (or
earlier by mutual agreement) Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on
all such matters, Buyer and Seller may mutually agree to extend in writing the
time to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Dispute Notice. In the absence of any such extension or upon
the termination of any such extension without any additional extensions,
either Party may submit any remaining Disputed Amounts to a recognized
independent accounting firm reasonably agreed to by the Parties in writing
(the " _Referral Firm_ ") for review and resolution.

(ii) Not more than fifteen (15) days after the Parties have agreed upon the
Referral Firm, each Party shall submit to the Referral Firm any supporting
materials and calculations with regard to any Disputed Amounts in the Closing
Statement. The Referral Firm shall review such Disputed Amounts in the
Closing Statement and the supporting materials and calculations and determine
the final adjustments with respect thereto, other than adjustments determined
under the mechanism regarding Title Defects and Environmental Defects set
forth in  _Exhibit A_. With respect to any Disputed Amounts under this
Agreement to be resolved by the Referral Firm, neither the Referral Firm nor
any Person employed by the Referral Firm will interpret the provisions of this
Agreement unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer. With respect to any
Disputed Amounts for which interpretation of this Agreement is required, and
for which Buyer and Seller cannot agree on such interpretation, such
interpretation of the Agreement shall be submitted to arbitration in a
similar manner as set forth in Section 8 of _Exhibit A_ regarding Title
Defects and Environmental Defects.

(iii) The Referral Firm shall render a decision resolving the matters within
thirty (30) days thereafter, unless the Parties reach prior agreement and
withdraw the dispute from the Referral Firm. At the time the Referral Firm
renders its decision, it shall provide a written statement of findings and
conclusions regarding the Closing Statement and any disputed amounts set forth
therein and shall issue a Final Closing Statement reflecting such decisions.

(iv) The decision of the Referral Firm shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The fees and expenses of the Referral Firm shall be paid equally by
Buyer and Seller. The fees and disbursements of Sellers independent advisors
incurred in connection with the Closing Statement shall be borne by Seller,
and the fees and disbursements of Buyers independent advisors incurred in
connection with the Closing Statement shall be borne by Buyer.

 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any matters in a Dispute Notice related to
the Defect Adjustment shall be resolved in accordance with the Title Defect
and Environmental Defect procedures set forth in _Exhibit A_.

(f) Not later than ten (10) days after the Final Closing Statement is issued,
(i) if the total of the Adjustments set forth on the Final Closing Statement
is greater than the total

 



\- 13 -   of the Initial Adjustments, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts specified by Seller such
difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two percent (2%)
calculated from, but not including, the date thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date until, and including, the date on which paid or (ii) if the
total of the Adjustments set forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than
the total of the Initial Adjustments, Seller shall pay by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to the account or accounts specified by Buyer
such difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal to the prime
rate published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two percent (2%)
calculated from, but not including, the date thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date until, and including, the date on which paid.

2.4 _Defect Escrow_. In the event that at the Closing there remains
unresolved Title Defect or Environmental Defect and Seller elects to cure any
such Title Defect or Environmental Defect after Closing pursuant to Section 3
of _Exhibit A_ (" _Post-Closing Curable Defect_ "), on the Closing Date Buyer
shall deposit a portion of the Initial Purchase Price equal to the sum of such
Title Defect Amounts and the Environmental Defect Amounts, as the case may be,
attributable to such Post-Closing Curable Defects in immediately available
funds (together with any interest accrued thereon, the " _Post-Closing Defect
Escrow Amount_ ") with the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree in
good faith that a Post-Closing Curable Defect has been cured at any time
during the Cure Period, then within ten (10) days after such determination,
the Post-Closing Defect Escrow Amount withheld with respect thereto shall be
released to Seller in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If,
at the end of the Cure Period, Buyer and Seller agree that Seller has been
unable to cure one or more of the Post-Closing Curable Defects, Buyer shall be
entitled to the Post-Closing Defect Escrow Amount withheld with respect to
such uncured Post-Closing Curable Defects, if any, which amount shall be
deemed to be a reduction to the Final Purchase Price. If, at the end of the
Cure Period, Seller and Buyer are unable to agree (a) whether Seller has
cured a Post-Closing Curable Defect or (b) to the Title Defect Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount attributable to a Post-Closing Curable Defect,
then the applicable amount of funds in dispute, and accrued interest thereof,
shall remain with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement until such
disagreement shall be resolved as provided in Section 8 of _Exhibit A_. The
Parties agree to deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent regarding the
delivery of the Post-Closing Defect Escrow Amount, or portions thereof, to the
Party entitled to receive such amount pursuant to this _Section 2.4_.

2.5 _Closing_.

third party):

Escrow Amount, if any by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller to Buyer;

(ii) payment of the Post-Closing Defect Escrow Amount, if any, to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement;

of Sellers Security as of the Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller to Buyer;

reasonably request.

 

2.6 _Allocation of Final Purchase Price_. (a) The Parties agree that for U.S.
federal Income Tax, Buyers purchase of the Membership Interests shall be
treated by Buyer and Seller as a purchase and sale of the Companys assets
subject to its liabilities, (b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to determine,
in accordance with all applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 1060 of the Code, the sales prices of the assets deemed sold and
purchased hereunder. No later than Closing, Buyer and Seller shall agree on a
preliminary determination of the sales prices, which shall be based on
the Initial Purchase Price and the Companys liabilities that the Parties
expect will be included in the amount realized for United States federal
Income Tax purposes on the deemed sale of the Companys assets. Buyer shall
propose (subject to Sellers review and comment) the preliminary
determination to Seller no later than five (5) Business Days before the
Closing Date, and once agreed upon, the preliminary determination shall be
attached to this Agreement as _Schedule 2.6_. Thereafter, Buyer shall propose
a final determination of the sales prices and shall notify Seller in writing
of the prices so determined (" _Buyer s Sales Price Notice_") within 10 days
after the final Closing Statement. Buyers Sales Price Notice shall differ
from _Schedule 2.6._ only to the extent necessary to reflect any differences
in (i) the assets of the Company on the Closing Date and (ii) the total amount
realized on the deemed sale of assets, from the assets and total amount
realized as shown on _Schedule 2.6_. Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
such proposed final determination unless, within 30 days after the date of
Buyers Sales Price Notice, Seller notifies Buyer in writing of (A) each
proposed deemed sales price with which Seller disagrees and (B) for each such
price, the amount that Seller proposes as the deemed sales price. If Seller
provides such notice to Buyer, the Parties shall proceed in good faith to
determine mutually the sales prices in dispute. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to agree upon the sales prices of the assets within 30 days after Buyers
receipt of such notice from Seller, then any sales prices still in dispute
shall be referred to the Referral Firm. Seller and Buyer shall equally share
all fees and any other charges of the Referral Firm. The Referral Firm shall
be instructed to deliver to Seller and Buyer a written determination of
the sales prices in dispute within twenty (20) days after the Parties
submission of the disputed items to the Referral Firm. Such determination
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parties shall mutually adjust the sales prices as determined hereunder
(whether or not any matter has been referred to the Referral Firm) to the
extent necessary to reflect any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, as
determined for United States federal Income Tax purposes. Neither Buyer nor
Seller shall take, nor shall either permit any of their Affiliates (including,
without limitation, the Company) to take, any position for Income Tax purposes
that is inconsistent with the sales prices as finally determined hereunder.

 



\- 16 -  2.7 _Effective Date_. For all purposes of this Agreement, (the "
_Effective Date_ ") shall be 12:01 a.m. Central Time on October 1, 2012.

than trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business, between
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller and the Company, will be paid or otherwise

following the Closing Date (which period may be extended for one (1)
additional month at the election of Buyer solely with respect to accounting
and information technology services, in consideration of the payment to Seller

(i) The United States federal Income Tax items with respect to the Assets of

with (i) reporting of United States federal Income Tax items includible in
Sellers Tax Returns under _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (or) items includible in

for such periods. Within a reasonable time (but not more than ten (10) days)
after Buyer or the Company receives official notice of any such contest,
audit or other proceeding, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such

other proceeding which relates only to United States federal Income Taxes or
Texas Margin Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 7.1(b)(i)_
or _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ but for which the Company is responsible under
applicable law for the defense of such proceeding, Seller shall have
the right to control (and, if permitted by law, shall directly conduct) such
proceeding at its own expense, whether such proceeding commences before or
after the Closing Date, provided that (i) Seller acknowledges in writing its
obligations under  _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ as
applicable; (ii) to the extent Seller believes that it will not be responsible
hereunder for Taxes to which such proceeding relates, it will cede control of
such proceeding to Buyer; and (iii) if a proceeding relates in part to Taxes
for which Seller is responsible hereunder and in part to Taxes for which
Seller believes it is not responsible hereunder, Seller and Buyer shall
jointly control such proceeding and shall cooperate, to the extent reasonably
possible, to avoid jeopardizing the other Partys position.

(ii) Unless otherwise required by law, the Buyer and Seller will treat any
payment received pursuant to this _Article VII_ as an adjustment to the
purchase price for Tax and financial reporting purposes.

 

(iii) Seller agrees to make available to Buyer and the Company records in the
custody of Seller, to furnish other information and otherwise to cooperate to
the extent reasonably required for the filing or audit of or other proceeding
with respect to United States federal Income Tax Returns and Texas Margin Tax
Returns relating to the Company for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date.

(iv) Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer, and Buyer agrees to cooperate
(and cause the Company to cooperate) with Seller, to the extent necessary in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return relating to Buyers acquisition

(e) After the Closing, this _Article VII_ shall supersede any and all Tax-
sharing or similar agreements to which (i) the Company, on the one hand, and
(ii) Seller or any affiliated entity, on the other hand, are parties. Neither
the Company, nor Seller or any such affiliated entity shall have any
obligation or right with respect to each other under any such prior agreement
after the Closing.

 



\- 35 -  (f)

(i) Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section
7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(c)_, or _Section 7.1(f)(iii)_, (x) the Buyer and the
Company (and not Seller) shall be responsible for preparing all other Tax
Returns (including for the avoidance of doubt production and severance Taxes)
due after the Closing Date, and any such Tax Returns that include any period
before the Closing Date shall (except as otherwise required by law or
expressly agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer) be prepared on a basis
consistent with prior Tax Returns relating to the same Tax; and (y) the Seller
shall be responsible for preparing and filing all other Tax Returns
(including for the avoidance of doubt production and severance Taxes) due
after the Effective Date and on or before the Closing Date. Buyer and the
Company shall not amend any Tax Return relating to a period ending on
or before or including the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

(ii) If the Company is required to file any Tax Return, other than those Tax
Returns to which _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(c)_, or 
_Section 7.1(f)(iii)_, apply, for a taxable period ending after the date of
Closing but covering days before and after the Closing Date, Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, shall cause such returns to be filed and shall be
responsible for payment of any Tax for such period. However, Seller shall pay
to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as appropriate, the amount by which the
Tax attributable to the portion of the period through the Effective Date
exceeds or is less than the sum of (i) amount of such Tax paid on or before
the Effective Date and (ii) the amount of such Tax taken into account in
computing the Initial Working Capital (the " _Tax Adjustment_ "). This
_Section 7.1(f)(ii)_ shall not apply to Property Taxes, which shall be
subject to _Section 7.1(f)(iii)_. For purposes of this _Section 7.1(f)(ii)_,
the Tax attributable to the portion of the period through the Effective Date
shall be determined as if the portion of the period through the Effective
Date were a separate taxable period (i.e., by closing the books as of the
Effective Date); provided, however, that in the case of any Tax that is a
fixed amount for the entire taxable period, the Tax attributable to the
portion of the period through the Effective Date shall be the product of such
fixed amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the portion of the period through the Effective Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period.
Buyer shall compute the amount of the Tax Adjustment attributable to the
portion of the period through the Effective Date, and shall notify Seller of
such amount in writing no later than twenty (20) days after the filing of any
Tax Return Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, is to cause to be filed under
this _Section 7.1.(f)(ii)_. Within twenty (20) days after such notification
date, Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as appropriate,
the Tax Adjustment, unless within twenty (20) days after such notification
date, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller disagrees with the
computation of any such amount. In that case, Seller and Buyer shall proceed
in good faith to determine the correct amount, and Sellers payment to Buyer,
or Buyers payment to Seller, shall be due the later of (i)the time specified
in the 

 



\- 36 -   immediately preceding sentence or (ii) ten (10) days after Seller and Buyer
agree to the amount payable. Seller shall be entitled to any refunds
(including interest) of Taxes under  _Section 7.1(f)(ii)_ attributable to
any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Effective Date except
to the extent such refunds were included in the computation of the Tax
Adjustments.

 

(iii) Ad valorem, on real and personal property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ")
attributable to the year of the Closing will be pro-rated as of the Effective
Date with the Seller being liable for such Taxes attributable to the days in
the Property Tax year through and including the Effective Date and the Buyer
being liable for such Taxes attributable to days in the Property Tax year
after the Effective Date. Such proration will be reflected in the calculation
of the Initial Working Capital. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
Property Taxes paid by the Seller or the Company for any period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Effective Date. Proration of Property Taxes shall
be made on the basis of the most recent Property Tax valuation and assessments
of the assets owned by the Company. If such valuation pertains to a Property
Tax period other than that in which the Closing occurs, within sixty (60)
days of the issuance of the Tax bill covering the actual Property Tax period,
Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as appropriate, the
amount by which the prorated Property Tax exceeds or is less than the amount
thereof taken into account in calculating the Initial Working Capital.

 

7.2 _Seller s Security_. Buyer shall have in place as of the Closing
sufficient surety bonds, cash collateral, letters of credit and guaranties,
as applicable, to replace Sellers Security. Buyer shall release or cause
Sellers Security to be released in full and unconditionally as of the Closing
Date.

 

7.3 _Non-Solicitation_. Buyer agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of
Seller or Seller Affiliate for a period of one (1) year from the Closing
Date, except for employees of Seller or Sellers Affiliate who are
headquartered at locations within the State of Texas. The foregoing exception
notwithstanding, to assure that Seller will maintain the benefits of certain
of its employees until the expiration of the Cure Period and as necessary to
provide any transition services that Seller may agree to provide to Buyer
after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees (i) until the expiration of the Cure
Period, except as otherwise approved by Seller in writing, to not solicit or
hire any employee of Seller or Seller Affiliate that Seller, in its sole
discretion, determines it requires to perform work necessary to cure any Title
Defect or Environmental Defect (" _Cure Employees_ "), (ii) to not hire any
employee of Seller or Seller Affiliate that is performing any transition
service to Buyer (" _Transition Service Employees_ "), unless Buyer has
notified Seller in writing that it will no longer require the specific
transition service, or portion thereof, being provided by such employee, (iii)
until after the Closing Date, to not hire any employee of Seller or Seller
Affiliate who are headquartered at locations within the State of Texas (other
than Cure Employees and Transition Service Employees) and (iv) if Closing does
not occur, not solicit or hire any employee of Seller or Seller Affiliate,
regardless of their location, for a period of one (1) year after termination
of this Agreement. During the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Buyer may enter into discussions with the employees
referenced in _Section 7.3_ (i), (ii) and (iii) above regarding potential
employment, provided that a representative of Seller is present during those
discussions. After Closing Date and prior to the expiration of applicable non-
solicitation period, Buyer may enter into discussions with the employees

 



\- 37 -   referenced in _Section 7.3_ (ii) and (iii) above regarding potential
employment. Solicitation for employment does not include general advertising
for employment opportunities." After the applicable non-solicitation period,
Buyer may, at its sole discretion, decide to employ some or all of the
individuals previously employed by Seller; however, Seller will not be
involved in any way with Buyers evaluation or selection of candidates should
Buyer decide to accept applications from any employees of Seller or Sellers
Affiliate.

7.4 _Trademarks, Trade-Names, Signage_. The trademarks and trade-names of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, including but not limited to the word "DTE"
(collectively, " _Seller Marks_ ") appear on some of the properties and
assets of the Company, including on signs at the offices of the Company, and
on supplies, materials, stationary, brochures, advertising materials, manuals
and similar consumable items of the Company. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that it does not have and, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, will not have, any right, title, interest, license, or
other right to use the Seller Marks. Buyer will (a) remove, within forty-five
(45) days of Closing, the Seller Marks from, or cover or conceal the Seller
Marks on, the properties and assets of the Company; (b) promptly ensure that
all Oil and Gas Lease and Well identification signs relating to the Oil and
Gas Leases and Wells are updated to reflect Buyer as the operator of the Wells
and Oil and Gas Leases, (c) file amendments to the Companys organizational
documents, as amended, to change the name of the Company to remove the Seller
Marks in accordance with this _Section 7.4_, and (d) submit notifications of
change of name with respect to any permits or licenses of the Company to the
extent that they use any Seller Marks.

and warranties made in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ hereof.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 8.1(a)_, all representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement, or in any agreements or instruments executed in connection
herewith or delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing for a period

and warranties of Seller contained in  _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ and
_3._ 4 and representations and warranties of Buyer contained in _Sections
4.1_ and _4.2_ (collectively, " _Fundamental Representations_ "), which shall
survive the Closing without expiration, and (ii) representations and
warranties contained in _Section 3.9_ which shall survive until sixty (60)
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the underlying Tax claim (including any valid extensions). Such
representations and warranties shall only be effective with respect to any
breach or claim when notice of such breach or claim shall have been given in
writing to the other Party in breach or against whom indemnification is
sought within such applicable survival period. Any claim for indemnification

 



\- 38 -   for which notice has been given within the prescribed period may be
prosecuted to conclusion notwithstanding the subsequent expiration of such
period.

 

8.2 _Indemnification by Seller_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.5,_ Seller
shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its employees, officers, directors and
Affiliates (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") harmless from and against
any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, judgments, losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys fees, but excluding as described in _Section 11.10_,
any consequential, incidental, punitive damages, lost profits or speculative
damages except to the extent arising pursuant to a third party claim therefor
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") imposed upon or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with any of the following:

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller in _Article
III_, except with respect to Taxes, a breach of a representation or warranty
made under _Section 3.9_ shall be limited to all Taxes other than Taxes
specified in (iii) below; or

(ii) the breach of, or default in the performance by Seller of, any covenant,
agreement or obligation to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;
or

(iii) Any United States Income Taxes, Texas Margin Taxes and other Taxes
provided in _Section 7.1(f)_ for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section
7.1_.

 

Buyer covenants that it shall not solicit or encourage third parties to
commence any proceedings or make any claims for which a Buyer Indemnified
Party would be entitled to indemnification under this _Section 8.2(a)_ and
shall not disclose any information with the intent of soliciting or
encouraging third parties to commence such proceedings or make such claims.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party of
notice of the commencement of an Action or other event giving rise to a buyer
claim with respect to which a Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 8.2_ (a " _Buyer Claim_ "), the Buyer
Indemnified Party receiving such notice shall notify (the " _Buyer Claim
Notice_ ") Seller in writing of the commencement of such Action or the
assertion of such Buyer Claim; provided _,_ however, that failure to give such
notice shall not relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder (i) unless the
Buyer Indemnified Party fails to deliver a proper Buyer Claim Notice prior to
the date specified in _Section 8.1(b),_ or (ii) unless and only to the extent
that Seller is materially prejudiced thereby. Seller shall have the option,
and shall notify Buyer Indemnified Party in writing within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of a Buyer Claim Notice of their election, either: (A) to
participate (at the expense of Seller) in the defense of such Action or Buyer
Claim (in which case the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim shall be
controlled by Buyer Indemnified Party) or (B) to take charge of and control
the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim (at the expense of Seller). If
Seller elects to control the defense, it will not compromise or settle the
Action or Buyer Claim if (x) the amount to be paid in settlement, when
aggregated with other Buyer Claims, exceeds the Maximum Indemnity Amount, as
defined below, or (y) the settlement does not include a provision releasing
Buyer Indemnified Party from

 



\- 39 -   all liabilities with respect thereto. If Seller fails to notify Buyer
Indemnified Party of its election within the applicable response period, then
Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to control the defense of such
Action or Buyer Claim. If Seller elects to control the defense of any Action
or Buyer Claim, Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and participate in the defense of such Action or
Buyer Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of Buyer Indemnified Party unless: (1) the named parties in such
Action or Buyer Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both Buyer
Indemnified Party and Seller and Buyer Indemnified Party shall have been
advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to it that are different from or additional to those available to Seller, or
(2) Buyer Indemnified Party has reasonably determined that Losses that may be
incurred may exceed either individually, or when aggregated with other Buyer
Claims, the Maximum Indemnity Amount (in which case, Seller shall not have the
right to control the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim on behalf of Buyer
Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that Seller shall not, in
connection with such Action or Buyer Claim, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
they are incurred).

(c) If Seller does not control the defense of any Action or Buyer Claim, then
Buyer Indemnified Party may settle such Action or Buyer Claim with the prior
written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

8.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 8.1_ , _8.5_ and _11.10_
, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller its Affiliates (other than
the Company), each of their respective past, present and future directors,
officers, employees, consultants and agents, each of the Companys past and
present (and, through the Closing, future) directors, officers, employees,
consultants and agents), and each of the directors, officers, heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (each a " _Seller
Indemnified Party_ ") harmless from and against any and all Losses imposed
upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party as a result of or in
connection with any of the following:

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Article
IV_; or

(ii) the breach of or default in the performance by Buyer or Buyer Parent of
any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Buyer or Buyer Parent
pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by a Seller Indemnified Party of
notice of the commencement of an Action or other event giving rise to a seller
claim with respect to which a Seller Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification (a " _Seller Claim_ "), the Seller Indemnified Party
receiving such notice shall notify (the " _Seller Claim Notice_ ") Buyer in
writing of the commencement of such Action or the assertion of such Seller
Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not relieve
Buyer of its obligations hereunder (i) unless the Seller Indemnified Party
fails to deliver a proper Seller Claim Notice prior to the date specified in
_Section 8.1(b)_ or (ii) unless and only to the extent that Buyer is
materially prejudiced

 



\- 40 -   thereby. Buyer shall have the option, and shall notify each indemnified
Party in writing within 10 Business Days after the date of a Seller Claim
Notice of its election, either: (A) to participate (at its own expense) in
the defense of the Action or Seller Claim (in which case the defense of such
Action or Seller Claim shall be controlled by Seller Indemnified Party) or (B)
to take charge of and control defense of such Action or Seller Claim (at its
own expense). If Buyer fails to notify Seller Indemnified Party of its
election within the applicable response period, then Buyer shall be deemed to
have elected not to control the defense of such Action or Seller Claim.
If Buyer elects to control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim, each
Seller Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
participate in the defense of any such Action or Seller Claim, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of Seller Indemnified
Party unless: (1) the named parties in such Action or Seller Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include both Seller Indemnified Party and Buyer and
Seller Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or
additional to those available to Buyer, or (2) Seller has reasonably
determined that Losses that may be incurred may exceed either individually,
or when aggregated with other Seller Claims, the Maximum Indemnity Amount (in
which case, Buyer shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
Action or Seller Claim on behalf of Seller Indemnified Party, it
being understood, however, that Buyer shall not, in connection with such
Action or Seller Claim be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) and that such
fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).

(c) If Buyer does not control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim, then
Seller Indemnified Party may settle such Action or Seller Claim with the
prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld).

8.4 _Consent to Settlement; Cooperation_. Either Buyer or Seller, as the case
may be (each an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in the defense of any claim or
litigation, shall not, except with the consent of the Buyer Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party as the case may be (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which (a) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party of a full and
unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation or (b) with respect to a claim settled by Seller as Indemnifying
Party, contains any term that would restrict the operations or activities of
the Company or any Buyer Indemnified Party. A Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall furnish such information
regarding itself or the claim in question as the Indemnifying Party, may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

8.5 _Limitation of Liability._

 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Buyer shall not be obligated to
indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article VIII_ unless
and until the amount of all Losses incurred by Buyer, or by Seller, as the
case may be, exceeds three percent (3%) of the Initial Purchase Price in the
aggregate (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Party seeking indemnity may

 



\- 41 -   recover Losses incurred in excess of the Basket from the first dollar above
the Basket, and (ii) Sellers maximum liability for Losses under _Section
8.2_ and Buyers maximum liability for Losses under _Section 8.3_ shall be,
in each case, twenty percent (20%) of the Initial Purchase Price (the "
_Maximum Indemnity Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (w)
Buyers obligation pursuant to Sellers Security in _Section 7.2_, (x) each
Partys obligation pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(i)_ and _8.3(a)(i)_ ,
respectively, with respect to breach of any Fundamental Representation, (y)
Sellers (i) obligation pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ and (ii) the
covenant set forth in _Section 5.10_, and (z) each Partys obligations
pursuant to _Section 11.2, (collectively, "(w)-(z)"),_ shall not be subject
to the Basket or the Maximum Indemnity Amount.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ with respect to
any inaccuracy or breach of any representation and warranty or covenant by
Seller or of the Company that is contained herein if, at or before the time
of Closing, Buyer, Buyer Parent or any of their representatives, attorneys,
accountants or agents had actual knowledge of the misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant or any of the facts underlying such breach.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ to the extent
the matter in question, taken together with all similar matters, does not
exceed the amount of any reserves or liabilities with respect to such matters
that are reflected in the Closing Statement and taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

(d) The amount of any recovery by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds paid
to any Buyer Indemnified Parties under any applicable insurance policy and the
amount of indemnification and other payments paid to any Buyer Indemnified
Parties under any applicable indemnification agreements or similar rights as a
result of the facts that entitled any Buyer Indemnified Parties to recover
from Buyer. Each Buyer Indemnified Party shall make all claims under
applicable insurance policies (other than self-insurance policies),
indemnification agreements and similar rights and to seek recovery under all
applicable insurance policies, indemnification agreements and similar rights
for all Losses to the extent such Losses are covered by any insurance policy,
indemnification agreement or similar right; provided, that such Buyer
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder shall not be affected
by such obligation.

 

(e) The amount of any recovery by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ shall be reduced by the amount of any net refund of Taxes
paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
are reasonably expected to realize as a result of the incurrence or payment of
any such Losses.

 

(f) The amount of any recovery by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ shall be reduced by the amount of any net refund of Taxes paid
or reduction in the amount of Taxes that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
actually realize as a result of the incurrence or payment of any such Losses.

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter
of Law and injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance)
and except in the case 

 



\- 42 -   of fraud or willful misconduct, if the Closing occurs, indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to any matters arising under or
relating to this Agreement, any Closing document executed and delivered
pursuant to the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the only legal action that may be asserted by any Party with
respect to any matter that is the subject of this _Article VIII_ shall be a
contract action to enforce, or to recover Losses for the breach of, this
_Article VIII_. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
no legal action sounding in tort or strict liability may be maintained by any
Party, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct.

8.7 _Title Defects and Environmental Defects_. Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Companys title to any of the Company Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges
and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for (i) any defect of title, including any
Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets and (ii) Environmental
Defects, in each case, shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth in
_Exhibit A_ , except as expressly provided herein to the contrary, such remedy
shall cease and be deemed to be finally and conclusively satisfied, in all
respects upon the Closing.

 

8.8 _Disclaimer of Other Warranties_.

(a) The express representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement are exclusive and are in lieu of all other representations and
warranties, express, implied, or statutory. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NO EXPRESS, STATUTORY, OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY
KIND IS MADE BY SELLER OR THE COMPANY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES

their mutual discretion, to extend this time period in this _Section 9.1(b_);
_provided that_ the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(b_) shall not be available to a Party whose failure to perform
any of its obligations required to be performed under this Agreement prior to

States or other United States Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order,

(d) by Buyer or Seller, if the aggregate amount of the agreed-upon Title
Defects and Environmental Defects exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the Initial
Purchase Price;

 

(e) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if Seller breaches or fails to
perform its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or breaches or failure or failures to perform (i)
would, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a) _or _Section 6.2(b)_ and (ii) cannot
be cured or, if curable, is not or are not cured within thirty (30) days after
written notice from Buyer; or

of Seller and shall forthwith be paid to Seller to be credited and applied to
the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and this Guaranty, or to be held
as collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this
Guaranty thereafter arising. Buyer acknowledges that it will receive direct

in order to determine whether Environmental Defects exist and (ii) the Oil and
Gas Leases and Wells set forth on _Schedule 3.18(f)(i)_ in order to
determine whether Title Defects exist.

(b) Buyer and its representatives may examine all abstracts of title,
title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files, assignments,
division orders, operating records and agreements, well files, financial and
accounting records, geological, geophysical, engineering and environmental
records, in each case insofar as the same may now be in existence and in the
possession of Seller or the Company, provided, however, that Seller and the
Company may withhold access to (a) all legally privileged documents and (b)
information that Seller or the Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona
fide, third party confidentiality restrictions; provided further that Seller
will use, and will cause the Company to use, its reasonable efforts to obtain
a waiver of any such restrictions in favor of Buyer. The cost and expense of
Buyers review of the title to the Oil and Gas Leases or Wells and
environmental condition of the Properties will be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer
will not contact any of the customers or suppliers of the Company or
its Working Interest co-owners, operators, lessors or surface interest
owners, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the
specific prior authorization of Seller, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the
Company and their respective officers, directors, agents, representatives,
employees, successors, and assigns against any damages arising from or in
connection with Buyers due diligence examination of title to the Oil and Gas
Properties or the environmental condition of the Properties.

2\. _Notice of Asserted Title Defects and Environmental Defects_. If Buyer
discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Oil and Gas Leases or Wells or
Environmental Defect affecting any of the Properties, Buyer may notify Seller
of such alleged Title Defect or Environmental Defect prior to the expiration
of the Examination Period, _provided_ , that such allegation is made in good
faith. To be effective, such notice (" _Title Defect Notice_ " or "
_Environmental Defect Notice_ ," respectively) must



     | (a) | be in writing; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | be received by Seller prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period; 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 1  reasonable detail including the basis therefore (including any alleged
variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest of any alleged Title
Defect) and any supporting documents; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | identify the specific Title Defect Property or Environmental
Defect Property (as defined below) to which such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect relates; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | include the value of such Title Defect Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount as determined by Buyer in good faith and in
accordance with Section 6 of this  _Exhibit A_. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the end of the Examination
Period, any matters that may otherwise constitute a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, but of which Seller has not been specifically notified
by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, will be deemed to have been waived
by Buyer for all purposes.

 

3\. _Cure_. Upon the receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice or
Environmental Defect Notice from Buyer, Seller will have the option, but not
the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title Defect or Environmental Defect
during the Cure Period (as hereinafter defined) at Sellers sole cost and
expense.

 

4\. A property affected by such Title Defect or Environmental Defect will be
referred to as " _Title Defect Property_ " or " _Environmental Defect
Property_ ," respectively.

5\. _Title Defect_.

 

(a) As used in this _Exhibit A_ , " _Title Defect_ " means, for each Oil and
Gas Property, any condition other than a Permitted Encumbrance, that now or
in the future causes the Company not to have Defensible Title, as defined
below.

(b) " _Defensible Title_ ," means, as of the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, other than Permitted Encumbrances, with respect to the Oil and
Gas Properties, such record title and ownership by the Company that:

 



     | (i) | entitles the Company to receive and retain from such Oil and
Gas Property, without reduction, suspension or termination, not less than the
percentage set forth on  _Schedule 3.18(f)(i)_ as the Net Revenue Interest
of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from such Oil and Gas
Property; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | obligates the Company to bear a percentage of the costs and
expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of such Oil
and Gas Property that is not more than the Working Interest set forth for
such Oil and Gas Property on _Schedule 3.18(f)(i)_ (unless such increase is
accompanied by a proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest applicable
to such Oil and Gas Property); and  
---|---|--- 
 



Page 2  Encumbrances 
---|---|--- 

6\. _Title Defect Amount; Environmental Defect Amount_. " _Title Defect
Amount_ " or " _Environmental Defect Amount_ " means, with respect to a Title
Defect Property or Environmental Defect Property, as applicable, the
reduction, in the Allocated Value (as set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ , of a
property as a result of the existence of one or more Title Defects or
Environmental Defects, respectively, which amount will be determined as
follows:



     | (a) | The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect
Property will be determined by taking into consideration the Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect (or if the Title
Defect Property does not have a specific Allocated Value, then the Allocated
Value thereof will be derived from the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas
Property associated therewith), the portion of the Title Defect Property
subject to such Title Defect, and the legal effect of such Title Defect on the
Title Defect Property affected thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | if such Title Defect is in the nature of the Net Revenue
Interest in an Oil and Gas Property being less than the Net Revenue Interest
set forth on  _Schedule 3.18(f)(i)_ with respect thereto and the
corresponding Working Interest remains the same, then the Title Defect Amount
will be the Allocated Value for the relevant Oil and Gas Property multiplied
by the percentage reduction in such Net Revenue Interest as a result of such
Title Defect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if such Title Defect is in the nature of an encumbrance,
then the Title Defect Amount will be the amount required to fully discharge
such encumbrance; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | if the Title Defect results from any matter not described
in Paragraph (i) or Paragraph (ii) above, the Title Defect Amount will be an
amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property
with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect Property without
such Title Defect (taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property). A Title Defect Amount may not exceed the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
Property will be determined by taking into consideration the Allocated Value
of the Environmental Defect Property affected by such Environmental Defect
(or if the Environmental Defect Property does not have a specific Allocated
Value, then the Allocated Value thereof will be  

---|---|--- 
 



Page 3  associated therewith), the portion of the Environmental Defect Property
subject to such Environmental Defect, and the decrease in value of such
Environmental Defect Property resulting from such Environmental Defect, the
amount of the civil penalty or fine assessed (or likely to be assessed) for
such violation where the Environmental Defect is a violation of Environmental
Law, or the cost to cure or otherwise remediate the Environmental Defect on
such Environmental Defect Property, as applicable; _provided_ the
Environmental Defect Amount may not exceed the Allocated Value of the
Environmental Defect Property.  
---|--- 

7\. _Procedures for Title Defects and Environmental Defects_.

 



     | (a) | If Seller and Buyer agree that a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect exists and if prior to the Closing Date, Seller or the
Company has been unable to cure such Title Defect or Environmental Defect
(and there is no dispute as to whether or not it has been cured), and Buyer
and Seller agree that Seller will not be able to cure such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the "
_Cure Period_ "), then the Initial Purchase Price will be reduced by the Title
Defect Amount or Environmental Defect Amount, with respect to such Title
Defect Property or Environmental Defect Property (taking into account the
results of any curative efforts made by or on behalf of Seller with respect to
such Title Defect Property or Environmental Defect Property). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement at any
time as to (i) whether a Title Defect or Environmental Defect exists, or if it
does exist whether it has been cured, or (ii) the amount of the Title Defect
Amount or Environmental Defect Amount attributable to such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, then dispute resolution procedures pursuant to _Section
8_ may be initiated by Seller or Buyer promptly following the inability to
reach an agreement. In such event, however and subject to _Section 2.4_ of
the Agreement, then the Title Defect Property or Environmental Defect Property
that is the subject of such dispute will not cause any reduction of the
Initial Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Buyer will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with
Seller after the Closing to assist Seller in its cure of any Title Defects or
Environmental Defects that have not been cured or resolved pursuant to
_Section 7(a)_. All reasonable third party costs incurred by Buyer in
providing such assistance to Seller will be borne by Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 

8\. _Arbitration_.



     | (a) |

If any Party hereto elects to submit any Title Defect or Environmental Defect
dispute to arbitration as specifically provided in this  _Section 8_, then
such Party will notify the other Party in writing (" _Arbitration Demand_ "). 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 4  to jointly select an arbitrator. For disputes regarding Title Defects or Title
Defect Amounts, the arbitrator will be an experienced oil and gas attorney,
familiar by training and experience with U.S. oil and gas legal and business
matters including titles and oil and gas transactions. This Person will be the
sole arbitrator (the " _Title Defect Arbitrator_ ") to hear and decide all
existing disputes regarding asserted Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts.
For disputes regarding Environmental Defects or Environmental Defect Amounts,
the arbitrator will be an experienced environmental attorney, familiar
by training and experience with U.S. environmental legal and business matters
in the oil and gas industry. This Person will be the sole arbitrator (the "
_Environmental Defect Arbitrator_ ") to hear and decide all existing
disputes regarding asserted Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect
Amounts. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on the Title Defect
Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator within the 15 day period, any
Party hereto must apply exclusively to a Texas court for the selection of an
Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator, respectively with the
qualifications set forth in this paragraph or other interim relief necessary
to protect the value of the Oil and Gas Properties and/or the Properties, as
the case may be. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Any arbitration hearing, if one is desired by the Title
Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator, must be held in Dallas,
Texas unless the Parties agree in writing to another location that is
acceptable to both Parties and the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental
Defect Arbitrator. The Parties agree that the laws of the State of Texas
(exclusive of conflict of laws principles) shall govern the arbitration and
the dispute regarding Title Defects or Environmental Defects. To the extent
not otherwise provided in this _Section 8_, the arbitration will be conducted
in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Seller may elect to
conduct the proceeding by written submissions from Seller and Buyer with
exhibits, including interrogatories, supplemented with appearances by Buyer
and Seller as the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator
may desire. The arbitration proceeding, subject only to the terms hereof,
will be conducted informally and expeditiously and in such a manner as to
result in a good faith resolution as soon as reasonably possible under the
circumstances. The decision of the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental
Defect Arbitrator with respect to such remaining disputed matters will be
reduced to a writing that states the arbitrators reasons for the decision and
shall be binding on the Parties. Judgment upon the award(s) rendered by the
Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator may be entered and
execution had in any court of competent jurisdiction, or application may be
made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of
enforcement. Seller and Buyer, respectively, will bear their own legal fees
and other costs incurred in presenting their respective cases. The charges and
expenses of the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator
will be shared equally by the Parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 5  the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator is selected in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 8_. In fulfilling his or her
duties with respect to determining the amount of a Title Defect Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount, the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental
Defect Arbitrator, as applicable, may consider such matters as, in the
opinion of the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator, are
necessary or helpful to make a proper valuation; however, the Title Defect
Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator will be bound by those factors
set forth in _Section 6(a)_ and _Section 6(c)_, respectively. Furthermore,
the Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the Title
Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator including, without
limitation, geologists, geophysicists, petroleum engineers, title and oil and
gas lawyers, accountants and consultants, and the fees and expenses of such
third parties will be considered to be charges and expenses of the Title
Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator. The sole remedy in any
arbitration award will be resolution of alleged Title Defects and Title Defect
Amounts or Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts which will
then be applied as provided in _Section 9_ and neither the Title Defect
Arbitrator nor the Environmental Defect Arbitrator will award any other
remedy, including, without limitation, equitable relief, actual damages,
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, attorneys fees or interest
reflecting the time value of money. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Any replacement Title Defect Arbitrator or Environmental
Defect Arbitrator, should one become necessary, will be selected in accordance
with the procedure provided above for the initial selection of the Title
Defect Arbitrator or Environmental Defect Arbitrator. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | As to any determination of amounts owing under the terms of
this _Section 8_, no lawsuit based on such claimed amounts owing will be
instituted by either Buyer or Seller, other than to compel arbitration
proceedings or enforce the award of the Title Defect Arbitrator or
Environmental Defect Arbitrator. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | All privileges under state and federal law, including
attorney-client and work-product privileges, will be preserved and protected
to the same extent that such privileges would be protected in a federal or
state court proceeding applying state or federal law, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 6  9\. _Limitations of Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Amounts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) there will be
no reduction of the Initial Purchase Price and no amount owing by Seller with
respect to a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect unless the Title Defect
Amount or Environmental Defect Amount, as the case may be, exceeds $25,000;
(ii) there will be no reduction of the Initial Purchase Price and no amount
owing by Seller unless and until the Title Defect Amounts and Environmental
Defect Amounts exceed 1% of the Initial Purchase Price in the aggregate (the
" _Defect Basket_ "), in which event the Seller will be liable for all Title
Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts in excess of the Defect Basket
from the first dollar above the Defect Basket, and (iii) the maximum
liability of Seller for all Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Amounts, in the aggregate, including all amounts owing before, on or after the
Closing, will be fifteen percent (15%) of the Initial Purchase Price. Buyers
sole and exclusive remedy for the reduction in value of the Companys title to
an Oil and Gas Property resulting from the existence of a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect will be as provided in this  _Exhibit A_ ; _provided
however_ , that, pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ of the Agreement, Buyer or
Seller may terminate this Agreement if the aggregate of the agreed-upon Title
Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts exceeds fifteen percent (15%)
of the Initial Purchase Price.

10\. [ _Reserved]_

 

11\. _Replacement Leases_. Seller may, with the prior written consent of Buyer
(such consent to be given in the sole discretion of Buyer), acquire, at its
sole cost and expense, any one or more oil, gas and/or mineral leases (each
such lease being a " _Replacement Lease_ ") and such Replacement Lease shall
be deemed to cure any one or more Title Defects agreed by Seller and Buyer on
a Net Mineral Acre by Net Mineral Acre basis and such Replacement Lease shall
be deemed to be a part of the Oil and Gas Leases for purposes of this
Agreement.
