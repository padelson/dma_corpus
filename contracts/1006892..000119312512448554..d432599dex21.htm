shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any such shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that shall include the summary term
sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the offer to purchase, form of
letter of transmittal, form of notice of guaranteed delivery, summary
advertisement and other ancillary documents pursuant to which the Offer will
be made (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable Law. The Company
shall promptly (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days following
Merger Subs or Parents request) furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives that may be required by the Exchange Act and other
applicable securities Laws or as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub
to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section 8.6, the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
(or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule TO to correct such information and to cause
the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto), including
the proposed final version thereof, before any such document is filed with the
SEC or disseminated to holders of 

 



17  Shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel or other representatives may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those
comments, and to provide comments on that response (to which Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration), including by
participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC.

 

(c) The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive, in whole or in
part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer; provided that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall:

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition or the Termination Condition;

 

(ii) decrease the Offer Price;

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares subject to the Offer;

 

(v) terminate, extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement;

(vi) provide any "subsequent offering period" with the meaning of Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act; or

(vii) impose additional conditions to the Offer or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the other terms of the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of the Shares.

 

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
11:59 p.m. New York time on the date that is twenty Business Days (calculated
as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the Offer
Commencement Date (the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_ "). If as of 11:59
p.m. New York time on the Initial Offer Expiration Date or any subsequent
date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, (i) any of the Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by Merger Sub, then, unless
Parent and the Company otherwise agree, and subject to the rights
and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), extend the Offer for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than five Business Days each, the length of
each such 

 



18  period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or for such longer
period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) until such Offer
Condition(s) are satisfied or waived, or (ii) the Offer is required to be
extended by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof applicable
to the Offer, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for the minimum period required by such rule, regulation or
interpretation or position; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not
be required to extend the Offer pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses
(i) or (ii) beyond the End Date unless Parent or Merger Sub is not then
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c), in which
case Merger Sub shall be required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date. In
addition, if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer beyond any then scheduled Offer
Expiration Date (i) for one or more consecutive increments designated by
the Company in its sole discretion (which designation shall be made by the
Company in writing to Parent not later than the date that is one Business Day
prior to the then scheduled Offer Expiration Date); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this
clause (i) beyond 5 p.m. (New York City time) on December 12, 2012 and (ii) if
the Company has delivered a notice pursuant to clause (w) of the last sentence
of Section 8.6(d) prior to the then scheduled Offer Expiration Date, three
Business Days after such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (ii) more
than once (the date on which the Offer finally expires taking into account
any extensions pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 2.1(d)_ is
referred to herein as the " _Offer Expiration Date_ "). In addition, Merger
Sub shall have the right in its sole discretion to extend the Offer beyond
any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer for one or more consecutive
increments of up to five Business Days each, the length of each such period to
be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or such longer period as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree) to the extent (x) Parent and Merger
Sub shall have waived the Financing Proceeds Condition, (y) all of the Offer
Conditions other than the Financing Proceeds Condition have been satisfied or
waived and (z) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing contemplated
by Section 8.11 (such alternative financing, " _Alternative Financing_ ")) has
not actually been received by Merger Sub or Parent, and the lenders party to
the Debt Financing Commitment (or to the commitments with respect to any
Alternative Financing (such commitments, " _Alternative Financing Commitments_
")) have not definitively and irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent and
Merger Sub that the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) in an amount
sufficient (together with the Equity Financing and cash available to the
Company) to consummate the Offer and the Merger will be available at the
Offer Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment (or
Alternative Financing Commitments) and subject only to the satisfaction of the
Offer Conditions (and contribution by Parent or Merger Sub of the proceeds of
the Equity Financing). If (x) the Financing Proceeds Condition has been
satisfied less than five Business Days prior to the then-scheduled expiration
of the Offer (including the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer) and
(y) all of the other Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived at the
then scheduled expiration of the Offer, then Merger Sub and Parent shall have
a one-time right to extend the Offer pursuant to this sentence and such
extension shall be for a period of up to five Business Days.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub, of the Offer Conditions, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent

 



19  shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as
practicable (which shall, in any event, be no more than three Business Days)
after the Offer Expiration Date, all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer (such acceptance, the " _Offer Closing_ ", the time on
which the Offer Closing occurs, the " _Acceptance Time_ ", and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs, the " _Offer Closing Date_ "). Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(f) The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Offer Expiration Date unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 10.1;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if at any date on which the Offer is scheduled
to expire, (i) the Marketing Period shall have ended and any Offer Condition
(other than the Financing Proceeds Condition) shall not have been satisfied or
waived and (ii) the Proxy Statement Clearance Date shall have occurred at
least three Business Days prior to such scheduled expiration of the Offer,
then (x) notwithstanding the provisions of subclause (i) of Section 2.1(d),
Merger Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer (provided
that prior to so terminating the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, notify the Company in writing at least one Business Day
in advance of such termination and the Company shall have a one-time right
(exercisable in the Companys sole discretion) to cause Merger Sub to extend,
rather than terminate, the Offer for one consecutive increment of five
Business Days, in which case Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, extend the Offer for such period) and (y) if the Financing Outside
Date has occurred, the Company shall have the right, exercisable by delivering
written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, to cause Merger Sub to, and upon
receipt of such written notice, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer at the
then-scheduled expiration date following the receipt of such notice sent by
the Company. The termination of the Offer pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Termination_ " and the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination Date_ ". If the Offer
Termination occurs, Merger Sub shall promptly (but in no event later than
three Business Days after the Offer Termination Date) return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares
of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Offer Termination shall not give rise to a
right of termination of this Agreement unless to the extent expressly provided
for in Section 10.1 and that, absent such any termination of this
Agreement, the obligations of the Parties hereunder other than those related
to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect notwithstanding the Offer
Termination, including those obligations with respect to the Merger. The
Parties hereto also acknowledge and agree that the occurrence of the Offer
Termination shall not limit or affect the right of the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(h).

 

Section 2.2 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company shall, or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent
and Merger Sub promptly with a list of the Company Stockholders, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of
Shares held in stock depositories as of the most recent practicable

 



20  date (and in any event the Company shall so direct its transfer agent to
furnish such materials to Parent and Merger Sub within two Business Days
following the date of this Agreement), and shall provide to Parent such
additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels, lists of securities positions and computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Shares) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Subject to the requirements
of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings, files and other information, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the
Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC and
disseminate to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to Section
8.6(e), describe and make the recommendations of the Company Board that the
Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become (or
shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect.
The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law.
The Company shall include the opinion referred to in Section 5.24 in the
Schedule 14D-9. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time
before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with
(i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications; and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration), including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. 

Section 2.3 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), the Company grants to Merger
Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof and the
Offer Termination shall not have occurred, to purchase from the Company a
number of authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Shares
equal to at least the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number
of Shares that would be owned by Parent and Merger Sub after giving effect to
the

 



21  exercise of the Top-Up Option, would constitute one Share more than 90% of
the aggregate number of Shares that would be outstanding on a Fully-Diluted
Basis immediately after the issuance of all Shares to be issued upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option (such Company Shares to be issued upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ ").

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole but not in
part, only once, on the Offer Closing Date and only if Parent and Merger Sub
shall own as of such time less than 90% of the aggregate number of Shares
outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable to the extent (i) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued and
unreserved Shares (treating Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as
unissued) or (ii) any provision of applicable Law or any Order would
prohibit, or require any Consent by any Governmental Entity in connection
with, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares
with respect to such exercise (and, with respect to any such Consent, such
Consent has not theretofore been obtained).

(c) If the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived by Merger Sub and
the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn, when added to the Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub, prior to
giving effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, does not represent at
least 90% of the Shares outstanding on the Offer Closing Date on a Fully-
Diluted Basis, Merger Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up Option
as of the Offer Closing and, on the Offer Closing Date, shall give the
Company written notice specifying the amount of Shares owned by Parent and
Merger Sub at the time of such notice (after giving effect to the Shares
acquired pursuant to the Offer). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of
this Section 2.3(c), the number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub
immediately before, at or immediately after the exercise of the Top-Up Option
shall exclude (unless otherwise directed by Parent or Merger Sub in writing)
shares of Company Common Stock tendered into the Offer pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures if such shares have not been delivered pursuant to such
guarantees as of such time. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding, together with
the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise,
conversion, or vesting of all outstanding Company Options, Company PSAs,
Company RSUs, Company Warrants, and all other outstanding options, warrants,
and rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and all outstanding
convertible debt, and, based on such number and based on the information
provided by Merger Sub, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger
Sub. The aggregate purchase price payable for all Top-Up Shares being
purchased by Merger Sub (the " _Top-Up Consideration_ ") shall be determined
by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without
interest. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Top-Up Consideration to be delivered to the
Company; _provided_ that Merger Sub may pay the Top-Up Consideration by (x)
paying in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company in writing, an amount equal to the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company an
unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the Top-Up 

 



22  Consideration less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause
(x) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (1) shall be full
recourse against Merger Sub, (2) shall bear interest at the rate of 5% per
annum, payable in arrears at maturity, (3) shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of issuance, (4) may be prepaid, in whole or in part,
at any time without premium or penalty and (5) shall have no other material
terms. The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the Offer Closing
Date, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as
possible. At the closing of the sale and purchase of the Top-Up Shares as
provided herein, the Company shall cause the Top-Up Shares to be issued to
Merger Sub in a manner that makes Merger Sub a holder of record in respect
to such Shares for purposes of Section 267 of the DGCL and 18-209 of the
DLLCA.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and for so long as
the Offer Termination has not occurred, the Company agrees that it shall
maintain out of its existing authorized capital stock, free from preemptive
rights or reservation, at least 49,125,000 authorized but unissued shares of
Company Common Stock for the purpose of issuance pursuant to this Section 2.3
and, for purposes of this Section 2.3, the Company shall take all action
necessary to ensure that no prior reservation of any shares of Company Common
Stock (including, but not limited to, any reservations made pursuant to any
Company Options, Company PSAs, Company RSUs, Company Warrants and any other
rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock) will impair the Companys
ability to have 49,125,000 authorized but unissued shares of Company Common
Stock available for the purpose of issuance pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 

(e) Concurrently with the issuance to Merger Sub of the Top-Up Shares (or, if
not concurrently, as promptly as practicable thereafter), Merger Sub shall
consummate the Merger in accordance with Sections 267 of the DGCL and 18-209
of the DLLCA and as contemplated by Section 8.1(d).

 

(f) Parent and Merger Sub understand and acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. The
Parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-
Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees
that the Top-Up Shares will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub further represents that Merger Sub will be, upon acquisition
of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable Law.

(g) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares or the payment of the Top-Up Consideration to the
Company, including the Promissory Note, will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any

 



23  Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by
Section 3.9(b) and Section 4.2(g), and the Parties and the Surviving Company
expressly waive and shall not present (except pursuant to explicit direction
of the Delaware Court of Chancery) any argument that any such dilutive impact
shall be taken into account in any such determination of the fair value of any
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

the " _Merger Closing Date_ ").

Section 3.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior
thereto (the " _Company Charter_ ") shall be amended so as to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_  and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company from and after the

Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company and

Section 3.9 _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder of any securities of the Company:

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company (including
treasury shares), Merger Sub or Parent (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like) shall be cancelled and retired and shall not
represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be exchanged
for any portion of the Merger Consideration.

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock owned by stockholders who have
perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and
shall not be exchanged for any portion

 



25  of the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into and represent only
the right to receive payment in accordance with Section 4.2(g); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such stockholder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under such Section 262,
then the right of such stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest thereon) as provided in Section 3.9(c). 

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than those shares cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.9(a) and Dissenting Shares, which are hereinafter referred to as "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into and become the right to receive
an amount equal to the Offer Price, in cash and without interest, payable to
the holder thereof in accordance with Article IV (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, all such Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and

Company.

 

Section 3.10 _Treatment of Company Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. Each Company Option outstanding as of immediately prior
to the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time (such
earlier time, the " _Acceleration Time_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall,
as of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time, be irrevocably cancelled,
extinguished and converted, without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the applicable Company Optionholder, into the right to receive a
cash payment, without interest, equal to the Closing Option Consideration,
payable by the Company as soon as practicable after the Acceleration Time in
accordance with Section 3.10(h). Such payment shall be reduced by any
applicable income or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law and, to the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Options to the
extent paid over to the applicable Taxing Authority. For the avoidance of
doubt, all Company Options with an exercise price greater than the Offer
Price or Merger Consideration (as applicable) shall be cancelled and shall not
have any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Company Warrants_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of any
Company Warrants shall be entitled to receive (except as set forth on Section
3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), in full settlement of such Company
Warrants, cash in an amount

 



26  (the " _Warrant Consideration_ ") equal to (a) (1) (x) $12.70 plus (y)
0.2562 multiplied by the Offer Price (or, if the Effective Time occurs earlier
than the Acceptance Time, the Merger Consideration) minus (2) $15.4675 per
Former i2 Share, multiplied by (b) the total number of Former i2 Shares
issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Warrant, the product of (a) and
(b) rounded down to the nearest whole cent. Such payment shall be reduced by
any applicable income Tax withholding required under the Code or any provision
of applicable Tax Law and, to the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Company Warrant to the extent paid over
to the applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(c) _Company PSAs_. Each Company PSA outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Acceleration Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Acceleration
Time, automatically become vested at target performance level and shall
immediately thereafter be irrevocably cancelled, extinguished and converted,
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of the
Company PSA, into the right to receive, in accordance with Section 3.10(h), as
soon as practicable after the Acceleration Time, a cash payment, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company PSA immediately prior to the Acceleration Time (assuming, for
this purpose, that all applicable performance goals have been achieved at
target level of performance), and (ii) the Offer Price or Merger Consideration
(as applicable) (such product, the " _Closing PSA Consideration_ "). Such
payment shall be reduced by any applicable income or employment Tax
withholding required under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law
and, to the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of such Company PSA to the extent paid over to the applicable Taxing
Authority. As of the Acceleration Time, all Company PSAs shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company PSA shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration payable in accordance with this Section
3.10(c).

(d) _Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Acceleration Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Acceleration
Time, automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions, and shall immediately thereafter be cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive, without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company or the holder of the Company RSU, a cash payment, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Acceleration Time and (ii) the
Offer Price or Merger Consideration (as applicable) (such product, the "
_Closing RSU Consideration_ "). Such payment shall be made by the Company as
soon as practicable after the Acceleration Time in accordance with Section
3.10(h) and shall be reduced by any applicable income or employment Tax
withholding required under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law
and, to the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of such Company RSU to the extent paid over to the applicable Taxing
Authority. As of the Acceleration Time, all Company RSUs shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration payable in accordance with this Section
3.10(d).

 



27 (e) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Company Restricted Share outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time shall, as of immediately prior
to Acceleration Time, automatically become fully vested and free of any
forfeiture restrictions, and, at the Acceleration Time, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive the Offer Price or Merger Consideration (as
applicable) with respect to each such Company Restricted Share. Such payment
shall be made by the Company as soon as practicable after the Acceleration
Time in accordance with Section 3.10(h) and shall be reduced by any
applicable income or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law and, to the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Restricted Shares
to the extent paid over to the applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Acceleration Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary (i) to terminate the Company ESPP,
(ii) in order that the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect
to any offering period then underway under the Company ESPP shall be
determined by treating a Business Day to be determined by Company that is
prior to the earlier to occur of the Offer Closing Date and the Merger Closing
Date as the last day of such offering period (the " _Final Investment Date_ ")
and by treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP, (iii) in
order that participants may not increase their payroll deductions from those
in effect on the date hereof or make separate non-payroll contributions
to the ESPP on or following the date hereof and (iv) in order that no new
participants may enroll to commence participation in the ESPP following the
date of this Agreement. Any shares of Company Common Stock acquired prior to
or on the Final Investment Date shall, if not validly tendered in the Offer,
be treated as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of
Section 3.9. Following the date hereof, the Company shall take no action
pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP to commence any new purchase or
offering periods.

(g) The foregoing provisions of this Section 3.10 shall apply notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary or any inconsistent provision in the Company
Stock Plans, the Company ESPP or the award agreements evidencing the Company
Equity Awards (as applicable).

through its payroll system, to each holder of Company Equity Awards, the cash

ARTICLE IV

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES AND PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

Section 4.1 _Payment of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall (a) designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article IV and, in connection
therewith, shall prior to the Merger Closing Date enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent

 



28  in a customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company, (b) deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in a separate fund (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), for the benefit of Company Stockholders, an amount in
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (c) instruct
the Paying Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Agreement. The Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Paying Agent shall not make
any investment other than in (A) interest-bearing time deposits or short-term
negotiable certificates of deposit (with maturities of 30 days or less) in a
commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$10,000,000,000 and short-term deposit ratings of at least P-1 (Moodys) and
A-1 (Standard and Poors), (B) short-term obligations (with maturities of 90
days or less) of or guaranteed by the United States Treasury or another
government agency or (C) money market funds substantially all the assets of
which consist of cash and securities or other obligations of the types
described in the preceding clauses (A) and (B) and (ii) any such investment or
any payment of earnings from any such investment shall not delay the receipt
by Company Stockholders of any portion of the Merger Consideration or
otherwise impair such Company Stockholders rights under this Agreement. Any
interest or income produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of
the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to the Surviving Company. In the event
that the funds in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by Section 3.9(c) and Section 3.10, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to, promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount equal to such deficiency.
No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. The Paying Agent shall
be required to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders and promptly make the payments provided for in Article III. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article IV such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent shall instruct
the Paying Agent to mail to each registered holder of a Certificate or book-
entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Company Common Stock (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as the

 



29  Company and Parent may reasonably agree prior to the Merger Closing Date)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration into which the number of Shares previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together
with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent),
the holder of such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.9(c), and the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to provide that the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Merger
Closing (and, in any event, no later than the first Business Day after the
Merger Closing) an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

(b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article IV, without interest.

(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article IV shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers in the stock ledgers of the Company of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Surviving Company
or the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.9(c) and this Article IV.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Company
Stockholders as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent. All Company Stockholders shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable to such Company
Stockholder at the Effective Time as

 



30  determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other Person shall
be liable to any former Company Stockholder for any amount properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

 

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, reasonably acceptable to the
Paying Agent, by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such amount as the Surviving Company may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(f) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event
that any change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding shall occur prior to the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price
or the Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change; _provided_ , that no such adjustment shall be made to
reflect the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and _provided_ , _further_ that
nothing in this Section 4.2(f) shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(g) Except as provided in Section 3.9(b), each Company Stockholder who has
perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive only the payment of the fair
value of the Dissenting Shares held by such Company Stockholder as provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written
notice of any demand for appraisal, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law
that are received by the Company relating to Company Stockholders rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
(or offers or attempts to settle the same) under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer or attempt to settle, any such demand for appraisal, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as (A) set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood
that the disclosure of any item in any such Section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section of
this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure is relevant to such other Section) or (B) as

 



31  described in the Recent SEC Reports (other than (x) any disclosures
contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements" and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein
of information, factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature (it being agreed that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC
Report shall be deemed to qualify the Companys representations and
warranties hereunder only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from
such disclosure in such Recent SEC Report that such disclosure is applicable
to any particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter) and (y) any
agreements filed as exhibits or other documents appended thereto), the Company
hereby represents and warrants as follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

business as a foreign corporation and is, to the extent applicable, in good
standing under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
and (ii) has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate,
lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now
conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing or have such corporate power and authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. True and complete copies of the Company Charter and the Company By-
Laws are included in the Company SEC Reports publicly available on or prior to
the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.2 _Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of

Company Disclosure Letter. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a duly formed,
validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except where

Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has the requisite corporate,
limited partnership, limited liability company or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power and
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is, to the extent applicable,
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for jurisdictions in which

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
each Subsidiary of the Company. All of such shares and other equity interests
so owned by the Company were validly

 



32  issued and are fully paid (and, in the case of shares of capital stock,
nonassessable) and are owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens, other
than Permitted Liens. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights,
calls, contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or
arrangements relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or
sale of any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of
any Company Subsidiary, including any right of conversion or exchange under
any outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any agreements granting any
preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first
refusal or similar rights with respect to any securities of any Subsidiary.
None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding equity
compensation plans relating to the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any payments based on the price or
value of any securities of any Company Subsidiary or dividends paid thereon.

Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder_

 



34   _Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles.

the date hereof, duly adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions

interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders that the Company enter
into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) declaring that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair
to the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iv) authorizing and approving

applicable Law to consummate the Merger, vote to adopt this Agreement.

Section 5.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the Company Charter or Company By-Laws, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section
5.5(b) have been obtained and all filings and other obligations described in
Section 5.5(b) have been made, conflict with or violate any Law or Order
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or result in any
violation or breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation) under, or result in the triggering of any
payments pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
Material Contract, or (iii) result in the creation of a Lien, except for
Permitted Liens, on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for such
conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults, the triggering of payments or
the creation of Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except: (i) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Schedule

Company Stockholders is required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger,
(C) any information statement (the " _Information Statement_ ") required under

35  in connection with the Offer and (D) such reports under the Exchange Act as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby; (ii) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and
any Antitrust Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction; (iii) any filings
required under the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Select Market
(the " _NASDAQ_ "); (iv) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to
the DGCL; (v) any registration, filing or notification required pursuant to
federal and state securities Laws; (vi) as set forth in Section 5.5(b) of the

authorizations, registrations, filings or notifications (A) required solely by
reason of the participation of Parent (as opposed to any third Person) in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the failure of which to be
obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6 _Permits; Compliance with Laws_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits
required to be held by them in order to own, lease and operate their
respective properties and assets and to carry on their respective businesses
as they are now being conducted and all such Permits are valid and in full
force and effect, except for any failure to maintain or possess any such
Permit, and except for any suspension or cancellation of any such Permit, that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has since December
31, 2007 been, in violation of any Law applicable to the Company or any of its

operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, and (ii) has all requisite corporate or
other similar power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its
properties and carry on its business as now conducted, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or have such corporate or other similar
power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has previously provided or made available to the Company complete
and correct copies of its certificate of formation, operating agreement or
similar organizational documents, each as amended to the date hereof.

of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of

event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would

 



52  constitute a default on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any of the other parties to the Financing Commitments under any of
the Financing Commitments and (ii) Parent has no reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to
Parent on the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate
the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required to
consummate the Merger), it being understood that in making the representation
in clause (ii) of this sentence Parent and Merger Sub are relying on the
truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company

(except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity and regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law) against Sponsor in accordance with its terms. There is no default
under the Limited Guarantee by Sponsor, and no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by Sponsor.

Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates, is or has been during the past

holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of Company Common
Stock or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any shares of Company
Common Stock.

58 ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

Section 8.1  _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, but no later than five Business Days after the Offer
Commencement Date, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), or any request from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements, to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act.

(b) Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC). Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response and shall in good faith consider such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

(c) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders is required
by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then the Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as of the record date
established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the later of (i) the earlier of the Offer Closing Date and
the Offer Termination Date and (ii) the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or Parent or any of the Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or
their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent, respectively, that, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth
in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such Party shall
promptly inform the other Parties. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. 

(d) If adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders is required by
applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then the Company shall, as promptly
as practicable (and in any event no later than the fifth Business Day) after
the later of (i) the earlier of the Offer Closing Date and the Offer
Termination Date and (ii) the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, cause a meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") to be duly called,
and then held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Vote within
thirty-five (35) calendar 

 



59  days following the date that the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys
stockholders (subject to adjournment or postponement as set forth below;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may delay the calling and holding
of the Company Stockholder Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) that
the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required (i) by
applicable Law, (ii) to comply with comments made by the SEC or (iii) to
comply with an Order in connection with this Agreement; and _provided_
_further_ , however, that at the Companys election such five Business Day
period and such thirty-five day period may be increased by a total of up to
five Business Days in the aggregate for both such periods (such that the
maximum number of days in the aggregate for both periods is forty-five (45)
calendar days). If adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders
is required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Company Board
shall, subject to Section 8.6, recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company Stockholders (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") at the
Company Stockholder Meeting and shall include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting
(i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, or (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer
Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and Merger Sub
shall own at least 90% of the aggregate number of Shares outstanding on
a Fully-Diluted Basis, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any Shares by
Parent or its other Affiliates, to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after the Offer Closing Date without holding the Company
Stockholder Meeting, in accordance with Sections 267 of the DGCL and 18-209 of
the DLLCA.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not be required to (and shall not) schedule the Company Stockholder
Meeting to be held prior to the first date on which either the Offer Closing
or the Offer Termination shall have occurred.

(f) Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking any action they are permitted or required to take
under, and in compliance with, Section 8.6.

 

Section 8.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and any Debt
Financing Sources and to the Representatives of Parent and such
Debt Financing Sources, reasonable access to their respective properties and
assets, books and records, and to the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Representatives, in each case in a manner 

 



60  not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to, reasonably promptly make available to Parent and
any Debt Financing Sources (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
lending laws and (ii) all other material information concerning its business,
properties, personnel and as Parent or such Debt Financing Sources
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would, (A) in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, result in the disclosure of trade secrets
or competitively sensitive information of third parties in violation of any
obligation of the Company to such third-party, (B) violate any of its material
obligations to third parties with respect to confidentiality, (C) be
reasonably likely to result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege of
the Company, (D) contravene any Law, Order, fiduciary duty or Contract then in
effect or result in significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or (E) in the opinion of the Companys legal counsel, be
adverse in any material respect to the interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding. The parties will
use reasonable efforts, if legally permitted, to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 8.2 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person
designated by the Company.

(b) All information and materials furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall
be subject to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Nondisclosure
Agreement, dated September 4, 2012, between Parent and Ruby (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that the Company hereby agrees that
disclosures required by applicable securities laws in connection with the Debt
Financing and the Offer shall be permitted.

 

Section 8.3 _Further Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and shall use (and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done, and
reasonably assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
that may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
Offer and the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article IX
and the Offer Conditions, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (a), each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) effect all
necessary notices, reports, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other filings, and obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, authorizations, orders, approvals, clearances and permits of, or
exemptions by (collectively, " _Consents_ "), any Governmental Entity and any
other Person that are required to be effected or obtained by the Company,
Merger Sub or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions

 



61  contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) prosecute all such filings and Consents
with all appropriate diligence; (iii) furnish all information required to be

contemplated hereby; (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement; (v) facilitate obtaining any final Order
or Orders approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistent
with this Agreement or to remove any impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (vi) defend or contest in good faith
any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, brought by a third-
party that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
in any material respect the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, in the
case of each of clauses (i) through (vi), other than with respect to filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are
dealt with in Sections 8.3(c) and (d) below.

 

(c) Without limiting any other provision of this Section 8.3, each of Parent
and the Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement) make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) as promptly as practicable make
all filings and deliver all notices required under all other Antitrust Laws
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
thereafter make all other submissions with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law and
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Law and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take all
other appropriate actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act or to obtain any Consents required under any other Antitrust Laws as soon
as practicable after the date hereof. Any such filings shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
resolve any objections asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other
applicable Law raised by any Governmental Entity, in order to prevent the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Order
that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) (A) executing settlements,
undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any
Governmental Entity or with any other Person; (B) selling, divesting or
otherwise conveying or holding separate or otherwise taking any other action
that limits Parents and its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to,
or their ability to retain, particular products, assets or categories of
assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries; (C) agreeing to sell,
divest or otherwise convey or hold separate or to take any other action that
limits Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or
their ability to retain, any particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with

 



62  or subsequent to the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time; (D) terminating
existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (E) terminating any venture or other

respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, entering into agreements or

with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
any of the foregoing and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by
consenting to such action by the Company) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ")
and (ii) defending through litigation any claim asserted in court or
administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental
Entity), in the case of both (i) and (ii) in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Order that would prevent the
Offer Closing or the Merger Closing prior to the End Date. All such efforts
shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified in any manner and no actions
taken pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be considered for purposes of
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. If any
Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, and
such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent hereby
consents to the taking of such action by the Company. Parent and the Company
shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable
any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger
Sub and any of their respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the
intention to, or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the
obtaining of approval of the DOJ or FTC as necessary. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require any Party to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Offer Closing or the Merger
Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require or obligate Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates to, and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, agree or otherwise be required to, commit to,
execute or consummate a Divestiture Action if such Divestiture Action would
have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (ii) Parent, Ruby, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Parent and the Company shall each advise the other promptly of (and
shall promptly furnish the other with copies of) any notice or other
communication received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from the FTC,
DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such Party proposes to make or
enter into with the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each Party shall generally keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to applicable Law, neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of
its respective

 



63  Representatives to participate in any substantive or material meeting or
telephone conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry pursuant to any Antitrust Law with respect to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or conversation.
Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in the filing of any
substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Entity and (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party with
copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(f) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of any effect, event, development
or change between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time that, to
the Knowledge of the Company, causes or would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 not to be
satisfied or of any Offer Condition set forth in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) of paragraph (d) of Annex A not to be satisfied. Parent shall notify the
Company promptly of any effect, event, development or change between the date
of this Agreement and the Acceleration Time that, to the Knowledge of Parent,
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.3 not to be satisfied or of any Offer
Condition not to be satisfied. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 8.3(f) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
the Party receiving such notice.

(g) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
to, (i) give those employees who are, as of the Acceleration Time, employed
by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") full
credit for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting, and benefit accruals
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Company
(collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entity) to
the same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such service shall be recognized to the extent 

 



64  such (x) recognition would result in the duplication of benefits or (y)
service would not otherwise be recognized by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent with respect to its own similarly situated employees; (ii) waive, or
cause to be waived, all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Acceleration Time; and
(iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period
during which any transfer of coverage occurs.

 

(b) From the Acceleration Time until the first anniversary thereof, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
to each Continuing Employee, compensation and benefit arrangements (excluding
equity-based compensation and defined benefit pension benefits) that are
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefit arrangements to
which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the
Acceleration Time. Without limiting the foregoing or the terms of any other
agreement, from and after the Acceleration Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with its
terms until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, each plan,
agreement or arrangement in effect as of the Merger Closing Date between or
among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its or their current
or former employees relating to severance, change in control, retention,
termination pay or similar benefits, including with respect to any payments,
benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event).

(c) This Section 8.4 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 8.4, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former directors, officers, employees,
contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 8.4 or is intended to be,
shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Company or any respective Subsidiary thereof.

 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to such time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, a director or officer (including as a fiduciary with respect to an
employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Company Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between
such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (i)
shall be assumed by the Surviving Company in the Merger, without 

 



65  further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii)
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms with
respect to any claims against any such Indemnified Party arising out of such
acts or omissions and (iv) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Company
complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting Section 8.5(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall jointly and severally: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against any Damages and
Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with any Claim
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of such Damages and Expenses) resulting
therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days
after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties
all Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Parties of all Expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with enforcing any rights
with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of
Expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable
Law, from such Indemnified Parties to repay such advanced Expenses if it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such
Indemnified Parties were not entitled to indemnification hereunder with
respect to such Expenses. The indemnification and advancement obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) shall extend
to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto), whether such
Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to an individual who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the
benefit of such individuals heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. In connection with any determination as to whether the
Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this Section 8.5, the
burden of proof shall be on Parent and the Surviving Company to establish
that an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. None of Parent or the Surviving
Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any threatened or actual Legal Proceeding for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, and
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement,
compromise or consent unless such settlement, compromise or consent is
approved in writing in advance by the Surviving Company.

(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 8.5, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all
limitations of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Company Charter or the Company By-

 



66  Laws or in the corresponding constituent documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter without any amendment
thereto.

(d) Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company may obtain prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance
policies covering each Indemnified Party for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to the
approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) for the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six years
thereafter and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and
amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions)
that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any
Indemnified Party than those of the Companys directors and officers
liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect on the date of
this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policies_");  _provided_ that the
maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year
shall not be in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage in its last full fiscal year for such insurance (which amount the
Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section 8.5(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter). If such "tail" insurance policies have been obtained by
the Company, Parent shall cause such "tail" insurance policies to be
maintained in full force and effect, for their full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Company. In the
event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then,
for the period beginning upon the Effective Time and ending six years
thereafter, Parent shall maintain in effect the Existing DandO Policies in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions (including with
respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company
than the terms and conditions of the Existing DandO Policies; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be required to
pay an aggregate premium for any such insurance policies in excess of 300% of
the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage in its last full fiscal
year for such insurance, it being agreed that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(e) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 8.5.

 



67 (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Claim
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against
any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall continue in effect until the
final resolution of such Claim.

Section 8.6 _Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitation, discussion
or negotiation with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal that existed
prior to the execution of this Agreement. Except as permitted by this Section
8.6, the Company shall not, and shall not cause or knowingly permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries respective Representatives
to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the making of an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or
furnish to any Person any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to any Person in
any such case in connection with or for the purpose of facilitating or
encouraging an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle, term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (any such documentation referred to in
this clause (iii), " _Acquisition Proposal Documentation_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.6(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time and the time
Company Stockholder Vote is obtained, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a written Acquisition Proposal, which
Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 8.6, (A)
the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law, then the
Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information (including non-
public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
 that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such
access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives,
and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall include a copy of the

 



68  Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of any substantive developments,
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal
(including any material changes, modifications or amendments to the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement with
any Person that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent any of the
information required to be provided to Parent under this Section 8.6 within
the time periods contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, all
information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.6 will be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 8.6, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal, (B)
withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company
Recommendation, (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9 or, if applicable, the Proxy Statement, (D) fail to publicly affirm the
Company Recommendation in writing within five Business Days (provided that
such five Business Day period shall instead be ten Business Days if an
Acquisition Proposal in the form of a tender or exchange offer has been
commenced) of the date of any request by Parent (which request shall not be
made by Parent more than once in any 15 Business Day period, which 15 Business
Day period is inclusive of the five or ten, as the case may be, Business Day
period by the end of which the Company is required to publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation pursuant to this clause (D)), or (E) publicly recommend
in favor of any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act in a solicitation or recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9
filed with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ", it
being understood that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation) or
(ii) execute (or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute) any
Acquisition Proposal Documentation (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.6(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the earlier to
occur of the Acceptance Time and the time the Company Stockholder Vote is
obtained, (1) other than in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company
Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of
Company Common Stock under applicable Law, the Company Board may effect
a Change of Recommendation, and the Company shall provide Parent with three
Business Days notice prior to making such a determination, including the basis
therefor (and, if three Business Days notice is not reasonably practicable,
then as much notice as is reasonably practicable), or (2) if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to

 



69  the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law, the Company may
(x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y) solely in the case of the foregoing
clause (2), execute Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to such
Superior Proposal if, in case of this clause (y) only, the Company
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board or any committee thereof
shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, (A) effect a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to this clause (2) or (B) execute Acquisition Proposal
Documentation with respect to such Superior Proposal unless (w) the Company
has given Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of
the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated), (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
in writing revisions to the terms of this Agreement, which revisions shall be
evidenced by an offer to amend this Agreement that would, upon the Companys
acceptance, be binding on the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, and, if
applicable, binding revisions to the Financing Commitments and the Limited
Guarantee, such that such Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board or any committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such
binding offer, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be given effect and (z) in the event of any material
change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (w) above and the notice period shall have
recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least two Business Days
(rather than the three Business Days otherwise contemplated by clause (w)
above); and  _provided_ , _further_ , _however,_ that any purported
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 10.3(a).

(e) Nothing in this Section 8.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company and the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing any position
or disclosing any information required to be disclosed under applicable Law or
in compliance with or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and to the extent referred to therein,
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not make a Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with _Section 8.6(d)_. In addition, nothing in this Section 8.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking any action
that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

Section 8.7 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Offer, the Company (acting through the Company Board or any committee thereof)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement that has been, or after the
date of this 

 



70  Agreement will be, entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with current, former or future directors, officers or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under which any such Person could
become entitled to (i) any additional compensation, enhanced severance or
other benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
compensation, severance or other benefits or any funding of any compensation
or benefits by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as a result of the
Offer (alone or in combination with any other event) or (ii) any other
compensation or benefits from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related
to or contingent upon or the value of which would be calculated on the basis
of the Offer, and to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe
harbor provisions of such rule.

 

Section 8.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acceleration Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards
(including derivative securities with respect to such Company Equity Awards)
in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is or will be
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 8.9 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. The Surviving Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Common Stock to be de-
listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

Section 8.10 _Parent Vote_.

(a) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall vote
(or consent, by written action in lieu of a meeting, with respect to) all
membership interests in Merger Sub in favor of the approval of this Agreement
by Merger Sub and the consummation by Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) If the Company Stockholder Vote is required by applicable Law to
consummate the Merger, Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock
purchased pursuant to the Offer and the Top-Up Option and all other shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates to be
voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

Section 8.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and subject only to
the conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments or on other terms no
less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub

 



71  to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitments and the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing. If all conditions to the
Financing Commitments have been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all actions reasonably within their control to cause the Lenders and the
Persons providing the Equity Financing to fund on Offer Closing (with respect
to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with
respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger). Parent shall not, and
shall not permit Merger Sub to, take any action not otherwise required or
expressly permitted under this Agreement that is a material breach of, or
would result in termination of, any of the Financing Commitments. If any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain Alternative Financing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.11(d).

 

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any default or breach
(or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party
under either of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii)
any termination of either of the Financing Commitments, (iii) the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect
to any (x) actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of
any Financing Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing
or any provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (y)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing,
and (iv) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, as the case may be. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the date the Company delivers to Parent
or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 

(c) Parent shall have the right, at its option, to amend, supplement, or
modify the Financing Commitments;  _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not
agree to or permit any amendments, supplements, or modifications to, or grant
any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing without
the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments, supplements,
modifications or waivers would (i) with respect to the Financing Commitments,
reduce (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless such
amounts may be paid at the initial funding of such Debt Financing by
making drawings under any revolving credit facility thereunder if required to
have sufficient funding) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the

 



72  Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the
Financing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
otherwise be reasonably likely to (x) prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to
the Financing. Parent shall further have the right, at its option, to replace
a portion of the Debt Financing up to the amount of the second-lien portion
thereof stated in the Debt Financing Commitment on the date of this Agreement,
by obtaining Alternative Financing from the Lenders or, as the case may be,
alternative sources, so long as such Alternative Financing would not (i) with
respect to the Financing Commitments, reduce (or would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing unless such amounts may be paid at the initial
funding of such Debt Financing by making drawings under any revolving credit
facility thereunder if required to have sufficient funding) unless the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other
provision of the Financing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) otherwise would be reasonably likely to (x) prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(y) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its
material rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing. The Debt Financing pursuant
to the Debt Financing Commitment (as amended, supplemented or modified as
permitted by this Section 8.11(c)) together with commitments obtained in
compliance with the immediately preceding sentence or Section 8.11(d) are
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and such commitments are
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Commitments_." Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver or documents relating to such Alternative
Financing (with only the fee amounts and certain other provisions redacted,
which redacted provisions do not relate to the aggregate amount of or
conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the Financing).

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or Parent
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes or would reasonably be
expected to make any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable, and such
portion is required to fund the aggregate Offer Price, Merger Consideration
and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, Alternative Financing from the Lenders or, as the case may
be, alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient (together with
Equity Financing and cash available to the Company) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon terms and conditions no less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and, with respect to the amounts

 



73  available under, and the conditionality of, such Alternative Financing, the
Company, than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the occurrence of such event (and, in any event, no later than the expiration
of the Marketing Period). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of all Contracts or other arrangements relating to such
alternate financing, and Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed
on a timely basis in reasonable detail of the status of the Financing and any
material developments relating to the Financing, including providing to
the Company all drafts and copies of definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing and all other material documents related to the Financing
(with only the fee amounts and certain other provisions redacted, which
redacted provisions do not relate to the aggregate amount of or,
conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the Financing).

(e) If any condition or other provision of the Debt Financing Commitment is
amended, modified or waived or if Alternative Financing is obtained for any
portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, in accordance with Sections
8.11(c) and (d), then each of Parent and the Company shall comply with its
covenants set forth herein with respect to the Debt Financing Commitment, as
so amended, modified or waived and with respect to such Alternative Financing
to the same extent that Parent and the Company would have been obligated to
comply with respect to the Debt Financing, as the case may be.

(f) Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best
efforts, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable
best efforts, in each case at Parents sole expense, to provide such customary
cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably required or
requested in connection with the Debt Financing, including (i) participation
(including by way of causing management, officers and advisors to so
participate) in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, "roadshows", drafting sessions, lender presentations and sessions
with rating agencies and prospective lenders, reasonably necessary for any
Financing, (ii) cooperating to facilitate the pledging of, granting of
security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral in
connection with the Debt Financing and using reasonable best efforts to obtain
such consents, approvals and authorizations which shall be reasonably
requested by Parent to permit pledging of collateral or otherwise in
connection with the Debt Financing, as well as facilitating the receipt of
documentation that will evidence the repayment of existing material
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and releases of any
Liens securing existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
each case upon the repayment of such Indebtedness substantially concurrently
with the initial funding of the Debt Financing (including (A) providing a
payoff letter contemplated in and otherwise complying with Section 8.16 and
(B) procuring that all of the Companys existing 8% senior notes due 2014 (the
" _Notes_ ") issued pursuant to that certain Indenture dated as of December
10, 2009, by and among the Company, certain guarantors party thereto and U.S.
Bank, National Association, as trustee (as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified, the " _Notes Indenture_ ") shall be satisfied and discharged as
contemplated by and otherwise complying with Section 8.15 upon the deposit of
funds with the trustee as provided in the Notes Indenture substantially
concurrently with the initial funding of the Debt Financing), (iii)
cooperating with the marketing efforts for the Debt Financing and using
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Debt Financing benefits from the
existing lending

 



74  relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iv) assistance with
negotiating, entering into, executing and delivering any credit agreements,
intercreditor agreements, guarantee agreements, pledge and security
documents, indentures, other definitive financing documents or other requested
certificates or documents, including corporate and similar resolutions,
closing, officer and secretary certificates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Board of Directors of the Company is not required to pass any resolutions
pursuant to this clause (iv), (v) using reasonable best efforts to assist in
obtaining such legal opinions and comfort letters and consents from
accountants for the use of their reports and materials as reasonably requested
by Parent, (vi) providing any information as may be required under "know your
customer" and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations, (vii) furnishing
Parent and Merger Sub and their Debt Financing Sources (x) within 40 days
after the end of any fiscal quarter ending after the date hereof that is not a
fiscal year end, with the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the end of such quarter and the related unaudited statements of income
and cash flows, which shall have been reviewed by the Companys accountants as
provided in SAS 100, (y) within 60 days after the end of any fiscal
year ending after the date hereof with the audited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year and the related audited
statements of income and cash flows and (z) such other pertinent financial and
other information as Parent shall reasonably request in order to consummate
the Debt Financing, including, in the case of an offering of notes or other
securities, all Company information, financial statements and financial data
of the type required in registration statements with respect to non-
convertible debt securities on Form S-1 pursuant to Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (subject to exceptions customary for
private placements pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities
Act) and of a type and form customarily included in an offering memorandum
with respect to a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act for financings similar to the Debt Financing, and, in the case of
loans, information and documents relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
customary for use in information documents with respect to the placement,
arrangement or syndication of loans of the type contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment, including customary authorization letters to the Debt
Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information pertaining to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders, containing a
customary "10b-5" representation with respect to information provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries and a representation that any public-side version
of such information does not include material nonpublic information (provided
that in no event shall the Required Financial Information (as defined below)
be deemed to include or shall the Company otherwise be required to provide (A)
pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments, (B) any description
of all or any component of the Financing, including any such description to
be include in liquidity and capital resources disclosure or any "description
of notes, (C) risk factors relating to all or any component of the Financing,

(information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (f) being
referred to as the " _Required Financial Information_ "), and (viii) providing
such reasonable cooperation as may be requested by Parent to facilitate the
preparation of pro forma financial statements by Parent (it being understood
that the Company shall not be required to provide any financial statements or
other data other than previously prepared historical financial information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ ,

following the date of termination of this Agreement.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated (A) in a manner that requires
or could require the payment of a Company Termination Fee pursuant to Sections
10.3(a)(i) or 10.3(a)(ii) or (B) pursuant to Section 10.1(d), then the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following
receipt of an invoice therefor, pay up to $8,000,000 of Parents reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) on or
prior to the termination of this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the existence of circumstances which require or
could require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by
the Company pursuant to Section 10.3(a) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 10.3(c); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 10.3(c) shall not relieve the Company of any
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.3(a).

(d) The Company and Parent agree that the obligations contained in Section
10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
that without

 



85  the Parties agreement to discharge such obligations, Parent and the Company
would not have entered into this Agreement, and that each of the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages
incurred by the applicable Party and is not a penalty. Accordingly, if the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee or, in
the case of the Company, Parent Expenses due pursuant to Section 10.3, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company commences a proceeding
that results in an award against the other Party for such payment, the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, shall in addition pay to the other Party its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the applicable fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 11.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the

Acceptance Time or (ii), except as set forth in Section 10.2, termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, as the case may be. This Section 11.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in
any document or instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement that by its terms applies in whole or in part after the Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time.

Section 11.2 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law and the
last sentence of Section 8.12, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that after the
Acceptance Time, there may not be any amendment of this Agreement that
decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration and (ii) that after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Vote (if required by applicable Law to
consummate the Merger), there may not be any amendment of this Agreement that,
by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval of the Company Stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

 

Section 11.3 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law
and the last sentence of Section 8.12, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the
Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights
of the Company Stockholders hereunder without the approval of such Company
Stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppels with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
Party incurring such expense, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

Section 11.6 _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed
by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood
that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures transmitted
by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be accepted as originals
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the documents,
schedules, annexes and instruments referred to herein or delivered herewith)
constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement.

Section 11.8 _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to any applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that
mandatory provisions of federal law apply). Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware

 



88  Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any court of the State of Delaware
or the United States District Court for the District of the State of Delaware)
for the purpose of any Legal Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, or any
of the agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, brought by or against
any other Party hereto, and hereby irrevocably agrees (a) that all claims in
respect of any such Legal Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court and (b) not to commence any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement
in any other court or before any other Governmental Entity. Each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert in any such
Legal Proceeding, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, (i) any objection to the laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court, (ii) any claim that such Party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, or (iii) any claim
that any such Legal Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum (if
brought in any such court). Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (A) no
Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other Party would not, in the event of litigation under this Section
11.8, seek to enforce any of the foregoing waivers, (B) it understands and has
considered the implications of such waivers and (C) it makes such waivers
voluntarily. Each Party agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.5 shall be effective
service of process for any Legal Proceeding brought against such Party in any
such court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court shall be
conclusive and binding upon such Party and may be enforced in any other court
to whose jurisdiction such Party is or may be subject, by suit upon such
judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees
that it will not bring or support, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to bring
or support, any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof), or, if
jurisdiction is not available in the federal courts, the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, and that the provisions of _Section
11.14 _relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action.

Section 11.9 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case, in
accordance with Section 11.8, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each
Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which a Party may be entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in
equity subject to and except as otherwise expressly provided in Section
11.9(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of the Company to obtain an
injunction, specific performance or other appropriate form of equitable relief
to cause Parent and Merger Sub to, or to directly, cause the Equity Financing
to be funded (but not the right of the Company to obtain an injunction,
specific performance or

 



89  other appropriate form of equitable relief, for any other reason) at any
time shall be subject to the requirement that (i) (x) with respect to any
funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Offer Closing, all the Offer
Conditions would have been satisfied as of the expiration of the Offer, and
(y) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Merger
Closing, all the applicable conditions set forth in Section 9.1 and Section
9.2 would have been satisfied if the Merger Closing were to have occurred at
such time (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be
satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject in such case to their being
capable of being satisfied at the Merger Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing
(or, in the case alternative financing has been obtained in accordance with
Section 8.11, such alternative financing) has been funded in accordance with
the terms thereof or would be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at
the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as applicable, if the Equity
Financing were to be funded at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as
applicable, and (iii) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to
occur at the Merger Closing, the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent
in writing that, if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded,
it would take such actions that are within its control to cause the Merger
Closing to occur. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy, and, except as expressly provided in Section 11.9(b), not to
bring any claim for monetary damages. Each of the Company and Parent
acknowledges and agrees that (i) each Party shall be entitled to seek to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
notwithstanding the availability of any monetary remedy set forth in Sections
10.3 and 11.9(b), (ii) the provisions set forth in Sections 10.3 and 11.9(b)
(A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to specific
enforcement, and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and other than
with respect to fraud:

 

(i) in the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable to the Company pursuant
to Section 10.3, the right of such payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, other Representatives, controlling
persons or assignees or Affiliates against Sponsor, Parent, Merger Sub, and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses
and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that Parent shall be obligated to the Company under
the provisions of Section 8.2(b) and Section 10.3(d) and for any of its
expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in the last
sentence of Section 8.11(f)) and the Company (on behalf of itself and any of
its Subsidiaries, stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, other
Representatives, controlling persons or assignees or

 



90  Affiliates) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and agrees not to commence (and
if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any proceeding against
any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the Debt
Financing; and

 

(ii) in the event the Company Termination Fee is payable, or the Parent
Expenses are payable, pursuant to Section 10.3, the right of payment of the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, as the case may be, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result
of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the
Company shall be obligated to Parent under the provisions of Section 8.2(b)
and Section 10.3(d)).

For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance with regard to the funding of the Equity Financing in
accordance with Section 11.9(a) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
under Section 10.3, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance with regard to the
funding of the Equity Financing of the type contemplated by the third sentence
of Section 11.9(a) and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fact that the Parties have agreed
to this Section 11.9(b) shall not affect any Partys right to specific
enforcement under Section 11.9(a).

The Parties also acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section
11.9 do not limit any rights that (i) any Party has in respect to fraud by the
another Party, (ii) any Party has in respect to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement or (iii) any Party has pursuant to Section 10.2.

(c) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for
in this Section 11.9 shall be the Parties sole and exclusive remedies for any
breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than in respect of fraud).

 

Section 11.10 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger, the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to
ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any
business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



91 Section 11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid
or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be unenforceable as written, the provision shall
be interpreted (and deemed modified) in such a way as to make it enforceable
while preserving as closely as possible the original intent of the Parties in
respect of such provision.

 

Section 11.12 _Publicity_. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.6, unless
and until a Change of Recommendation has occurred in accordance with Section
8.6(e), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release (other than the mutually agreed press release
to be issued on the date hereof) with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
(but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement or SEC filing as may,
upon the advice of outside counsel to such Party, be required by law, the
rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange (including the NASDAQ)
or applicable fiduciary duties.

 

Section 11.13 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Merger Closing, Parent or
Merger Sub may (i) assign all (but not less than all) of its rights or
obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned (direct or indirect) subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub (including Ruby
and any wholly-owned (direct or indirect) subsidiary of Ruby), provided that
no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations
hereunder, and (ii) collaterally assign any or all of its rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source. Nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent or otherwise impede the transfer or other
assignment of the equity interests in Parent or Merger Sub (or both) to any
Affiliate thereof (including Ruby or any wholly-owned (direct or indirect)
subsidiary of Ruby).

 

(b) Subject to Section 11.13(a), this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except (i) as otherwise specifically
provided in Section 8.5; (ii) for the right of the Company Stockholders to
receive the Merger Consideration following the Effective Time; (iii) for the
right of the holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the Closing Equity
Award Consideration following the Acceleration Time; (iv) for the rights of
Persons who are explicitly third-party beneficiaries of the Equity Financing
Commitment solely to the extent set forth

 



92  therein; and (v) the Debt Financing Sources, which shall be intended third
party beneficiaries of Sections 11.8, 11.9, 11.13, 11.14 and 11.15 and shall
be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no amendment or
modification to such provisions in respect to the Debt Financing Sources may
be made without the prior consent of the Debt Financing Sources); this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 

Section 11.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON OR ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT, AS A NON-
COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT, ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 

Section 11.15 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
representative or affiliate of any Party hereto, any Debt Financing Source or
any Equity Financing source (or of any of their respective affiliates) shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or
liabilities of such Party arising under, in connection with or related to this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
Section 11.9, nothing in this Section 11.15 shall limit any liability of the
Parties to this Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including with respect to the payment of the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (or limit any liability of the
parties to any other agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of
such agreement (including the Limited Guarantee)).

[Signature Page to Merger Agreement] _ANNEX A_

 

Conditions to the Offer

Capitalized terms used in this Annex A and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to
which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger
Sub shall not be required, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if:

 

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares that,
when added to the Shares owned by Merger Sub, represents at least 79% of the
aggregate number of Shares outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis, in each case
as of the expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); or

(b) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act shall have neither expired nor been terminated; or

(c) neither a clearance decision by the FCO has been adopted under the German
Act Against Restraints of Competition nor the applicable statutory review
period under that Act has expired, in connection with the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby; or

 

(d) at any time after the date of the Agreement and prior to the expiration of
the Offer, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing as of
the expiration of the Offer:

(i) a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order or enacted a Law that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the making or consummation of the Offer, the exercise or
consummation of the Top-Up Option (if the exercise of the Top-Up Option
is necessary to ensure that Parent and Merger Sub own at least 90% of the
aggregate number of Shares outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis) or the
consummation of the Merger;

 

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth in
Section 5.7(a) (other than the first sentence thereof), Section 5.7(b),
Section 5.7(g), the last sentence of Section 5.7(f), the first sentence of
Section 5.22 and Section 5.24 of the Agreement shall not be true and correct
in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and the Acceptance Time as
though made at and as of the Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation and warranty speaks as of an earlier specified date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as
of such specified date), (B)

 



A-1   set forth in Sections 5.3(a) and (c) and the first sentence of Section
5.7(a) shall not be true and correct in all material respects as of the date
of the Agreement and the Acceptance Time as though made at and as of the
Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such representation and warranty
speaks as of an earlier specified date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct in all material respects as of
such specified date), or (C) set forth in the Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties referred to in clause (A) or (B) above) shall
not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and the Acceptance
Time as though made at and as of the Acceptance Time (except to the extent any
such representation and warranty speaks as of an earlier specified date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true
and correct as of such specified date); _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition in clause (C), no
effect shall be given to any exception in such representations and warranties
relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect, and instead, for
purposes of this condition in clause (C), such representations and warranties
shall be deemed true and correct unless the failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, as has had or would be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Solely for purposes of clause (B) above, if one or more
inaccuracies in Sections 5.3(a) and (c) of the Agreement would be cause the
aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, refinance the Indebtedness of the Company and pay all
fees and expenses in connection therewith to increase by $10,000,000 or more,
such inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered material;

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with all obligations required to be performed by it under the
Agreement and to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the Offer
Closing;

have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(v) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms (the
" _Termination Condition_ "); and

 

(vi) if the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to ensure that Merger
Sub owns at least 90% of the aggregate number of Shares outstanding on a
Fully-Diluted Basis, the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option
together with the Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn are insufficient for Parent and its Affiliates to own at least 90%
of the aggregate number of Shares outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis; or

(e) Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall not have
received the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing) and

Alternative Financing Commitments)

 



A-2   and subject only to the satisfaction of the other Offer Conditions (and the
contribution by Parent or Merger Sub of the Equity Financing); provided that
this clause (ii) shall not apply if the proceeds contemplated by clause (i)
have been received)) (the " _Financing Proceeds Condition_ ").

The Company shall furnish Parent with a certificate signed on its behalf by a
duly appointed and authorized officer of the Company (solely in each of his or
her capacity as an officer of the Company without personal liability),
certifying that none of the conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and
(iv) of paragraph (d) of this Annex A shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the Offer Expiration Date.

 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied,
Parent and Merger Sub shall include for purposes of determination thereof
Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures if and
only if Shares have been delivered pursuant to such procedures prior to the
time of determination.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law, the
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
(except for the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition, which are
also for the benefit of the Company) and may, solely to the extent permitted
by Section 2.1 of the Agreement, be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the
Offer. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation
of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The failure by
Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and, each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Section 3\. _Notice of Meetings and Record Date_. (a) The Corporation shall
give notice of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. Notices of
meetings of the stockholders shall state the place, if any, date, and hour of
the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such meeting. In the case of a special meeting, the notice shall state the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. No business other than
that specified in the notice thereof shall be transacted at any
special meeting. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, notice shall be given to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting not fewer than ten days or more than sixty
days before the date of the meeting. 

(b) Notice to stockholders may be given by personal delivery, mail, or, with

other means of electronic

 



C-1   transmission. If mailed, such notice shall be delivered by postage prepaid
envelope directed to each stockholder at such stockholders address as it

deposited in the United States mail. An affidavit of the secretary or an
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation
that the notice has been given by personal delivery, by mail, or by a form of

Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty or fewer than
ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes

of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice

preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, or by these Bylaws, the
presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the aggregate voting power of the stock issued and outstanding, entitled to
vote thereat, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at
all meetings of the stockholders. If such majority shall not be present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders present,
although less than a quorum, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to
another time and place.

Section 5\. _Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting is adjourned to another time

be given of the adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any,
thereof and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the stockholders may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting. If an adjournment is for more than 30 days a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the

new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with
Article II, Section 3(c) of these Bylaws and shall give notice of the
adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned
meeting.

Section 6\. _Vote Required_. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation:

 



C-2  (a) Directors shall be elected by a plurality in voting power of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of the
stockholders and entitled to vote in the election of directors; and

(b) Whenever any corporate action other than the election of directors is to
be taken, it shall be authorized by a majority in voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of stockholders and
entitled to vote on the subject matter.

Section 7\. _Manner of Voting; Proxies_. (a) At each meeting of stockholders,
each stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person
or by proxy. Each stockholder shall be entitled to vote each share of stock
having voting power and registered in such stockholders name on the books of
the Corporation on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting.

(b) Each person entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if
it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

Section 8\. _Stockholder Action Without a Meeting_. (a) Except as otherwise
provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to
be taken at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action that
may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book or books
in which meetings of stockholders are recorded; _provided_ , _however_ , that
delivery made to the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware
shall be by hand or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice
of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented
in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been
the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of the holders
to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

(b) A telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission consenting to an
action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed, and dated for the purposes of these Bylaws,
provided that any such telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission
sets forth or is delivered with the information required by, and is otherwise
delivered in accordance with, the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. Any consent by means of telegram, cablegram, or other electronic
transmission shall be deemed

 



C-3   to have been signed on the date on which such telegram, cablegram, or
electronic transmission was transmitted.

 

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date. Such record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directions. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is
required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws,
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in the
manner set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 8\. If no record
date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action of the Board of
Directors is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or
these Bylaws, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of
business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
taking such prior action.

meeting or attend the meeting, except that if such director attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened, then such director shall not be deemed to have waived notice of

of Directors or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or

power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any
person who is made or threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any

Corporation, or while not serving as a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of Another Enterprise.

Section 2\. _Advancement of Expenses_. (a) , With respect to any person who

the Corporation shall pay to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable
law the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by such person in

ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
for such expenses under this Article VI or otherwise.

(b) With respect to any person who is made or threatened to be made a party
to any Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an

hereto with respect to any act or omission of such person occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption (regardless of
whether the Proceeding relating to such acts or omissions is commenced before
or after the time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption). The
Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any person serving at the

Another Enterprise providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if
the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in
this Article VII.

Section 5\. _Claims_. (a) If (X) a claim under Section 1(a) of this Article
VI with respect to any right to indemnification is not paid in full by the
Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation or (Y) a claim under Section 2(a) of this Article VI with respect
to any right to the advancement of expenses is not paid in full by the
Corporation within twenty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, then the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or
to an advancement of expenses, as the case may be, may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.

(b) If a suit brought pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Article VI is not
frivolous or brought in bad faith, or if a suit is brought by the Corporation
to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking or otherwise), the person seeking to

 



C-10   enforce a right to indemnification or an advancement of expenses hereunder
or the person from whom the Corporation sought to recover an advancement of
expenses, as the case may be, shall be entitled to be paid by the Corporation
the expenses (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting or defending such
suit.

(c) In any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a person seeking to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a
defense that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification has not
met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable law. With
respect to any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i) the failure
of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to commencement of such
suit that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct under
applicable law, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Corporation that such
person has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall create a
presumption that such person has not met the applicable standards of conduct
or, in a case brought by such person seeking to enforce a right
to indemnification, be a defense to such suit.

(d) In any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the Corporation
to prove that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to
an advancement of expenses or the person from whom the Corporation seeks to
recover an advancement of expenses is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such an advancement of expenses, under this Article VI or otherwise.

Section 6\. _Non-Exclusive Rights_. The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided in this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any person may be entitled under any statute or
provision of Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in
such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be
such director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.

Section 7.  _Insurance_. The Corporation shall purchase and maintain
insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect
itself andany person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a

liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Article VI or otherwise.

 

Section 8\. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article VI
shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation,

 



C-11   each portion of any paragraph or clause containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this Article VI (including, without limitation, each such portion of any
paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect
to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable.

Another Enterprise shall include any service as a director or officer of the

the request of the Corporation as a employee or agent of Another Enterprise
shall include any service as an employee or agent of the Corporation that

respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation;
and (d) references to a director of Another Enterprise shall include, in the
case of any entity that is not managed by a board of directors, such other
