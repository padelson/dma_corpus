AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated August 10, 2020,
is by and among Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Pelican Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"), and Pfenex Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company are sometimes referred to as a "Party." All capitalized terms that are
used in this Agreement but not defined in this Agreement shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in _Annex A_.

RECITALS

 

A. It is proposed that Acquisition Sub shall commence a tender offer (the
"Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than the Cancelled Company Shares) for (i) $12.00 per share, net to the
holder thereof, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof, in cash (such amount, or any different amount per
share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as
the "Cash Portion"), and (ii) the contractual right pursuant to the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as  _Annex C_ (as it may
be amended from time to time, the "CVR Agreement"), to receive a contingent
payment upon the achievement of a certain milestone as set forth in the CVR
Agreement, without interest (the "CVR Portion", and together with the Cash
Portion, the "Offer Price"), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

 

B. It is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the consummation
of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") and each share of Company Common Stock that is not
tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Cancelled Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

C. The Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and will be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

D. The Company Board has (i) determined that the terms of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to,

in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub, in each case immediately prior to the
commencement of the Offer ("Cancelled Company Shares"), irrevocably accepted
for purchase pursuant to the Offer ("Accepted Company Shares") shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

 



-11- 

    

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the granting or
other issuance of Company Options in the ordinary course of business),
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither
have voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_, but shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company
Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and
each Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of
the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL
shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to be consulted
on all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



-12- 

    

(d) _Company Options_.

 

(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company, or the holders thereof, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be accelerated in
full. 

(ii) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company, or the holders thereof, each In-The-Money Company Option that remains
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the
right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such In-The-Money Company Option, upon the terms of this Agreement, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the
Cash Portion over (2) the per share exercise price of such In-The-Money
Company Option, plus (B) the CVR Portion (collectively, the
"Option Consideration"), subject, in each case, to applicable Tax
withholdings. The CVR Portion in respect of each In-The-Money Company Option
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable to the CVR
Portion in respect of Company Common Stock generally.

(iii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the former
holder of each such cancelled In-The-Money Company Option, in accordance with
its normal payroll processes, as promptly as practicable (and in no event
later than the first payroll date of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time), the foregoing payments to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any Out-of-The Money Company Option, by virtue of the occurrence of
the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders thereof, such Out-
of-The Money Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall also not be eligible to receive the CVR Portion).

 

(iv) The Company shall send a written notice in a form provided in advance,
and reasonably acceptable to Parent, to each holder of an outstanding Company
Option in accordance with the Company Stock Plans that shall inform such
holder of the treatment of the Company Options, as applicable, provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective as of no later than immediately
preceding the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated the Company
ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Companys ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions with
respect to the Company ESPP to provide that (i) all outstanding purchase
rights under the Company ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESPP, no later than one Business Day prior to
the Effective Time (the "Final Purchase"), (ii) the Company ESPP shall
terminate with such purchase and no further purchase rights will be granted
under the Company ESPP thereafter, (iii) each individual participating in the
Company ESPP shall not be permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her
rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect on the date
of this Agreement, or (y) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the
Company ESPP on or 

 



-13- 

    

 following the date of this Agreement, (iv) no individual who is not
participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may
commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement, and (v) the Administrator (as defined in the Company ESPP) will
notify each participant in writing or electronically prior to the Final
Purchase, that the exercise date for the participants option has been
changed to the date of the Final Purchase and that the Participants option
will be exercised automatically on the date of the Final Purchase. All shares
of Company Common Stock purchased in the Final Purchase shall be cancelled at
the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(f) _Implementation_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, and in any event prior to the Expiration Time, the Company Board or a
committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take such other actions as may be required to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by _Sections_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ and 2.7(e) under the
Company Stock Plans, all Company Option agreements, the Company ESPP, and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company.

 

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, at its sole
cost and expense, (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent")
and to act as rights agent (in such capacity, the "Rights Agent") under the
CVR Agreement and (ii) enter into a payment and rights agent agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment
Agent and Rights Agent.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, an amount of cash
equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common
Stock become entitled under this Article II (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the Option Consideration). Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America with a maturity of no more than 30 days (such cash amount being
referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund") provided that Parent
shall not be required to deposit the funds related to the CVR Portion
with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit is required pursuant to
the terms of the CVR Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments of the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs. To the extent that (A) there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Article II, or (C) all or
any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment
Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
this Article II for any reason, then Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully
available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this Article II.

 



-14- 

    

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and (ii) book-entry security
entitlements to or other uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (A)
a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent),
and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, by (y)
the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is

 



-15- 

    

 properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer
and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, and established to the satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, the Rights Agent,
Parent, Acquisition Sub, any Affiliate of Parent, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement and pay to the applicable Taxing Authority such
amounts that each of the Payment Agent, the Rights Agent, Parent, Acquisition
Sub, any Affiliate of Parent, or the Surviving Corporation is required to
deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation nor any other Party shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of any amounts that would otherwise have been
payable in respect of any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto)
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger for exchange
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall thereafter look
for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving 

 



-16- 

    

 Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of
the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to any Person as a result of
the exercise of or in settlement of Company Options, and that such Company
Options shall be cancelled and the holders of such Company Options shall only
be entitled to receive the consideration, if any, provided to them under
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and shall not have any other rights or remedies with
respect thereto.

 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation), the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7_; _provided_ that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and
as condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

-17- 

    

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature or conduct of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect
for the Company. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its

action on the part of the Company, and no additional corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, assuming the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally, and (b) is subject to general
principles of equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

 

3.3 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Requisite
Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company Capital Stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have
been necessary under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement do not and will not, directly or indirectly (a)
violate or conflict with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company, (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in

with, or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
require any notice, consent, waiver or approval of, or result in the
termination of, cancellation of, modification or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination, cancellation, modification
or acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract to which the Company is a party or by which any of its assets or
properties may be bound, (c) assuming the Filings and Consents referred to in
Section 3.5 are obtained or made and, in the case of the consummation of the
Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or
conflict with any Law or Order applicable to the Company or by which any of
their properties or assets are bound, or (d) result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for

referred to in this Agreement as a "Consent"), or filing, registration,

this Agreement as a "Filing"), any Governmental Authority is required on the
part of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the

state securities Laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act, (c) Filings and Consents required under, and compliance
with any other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act, and (d) such other
Filings and Consents, the failure of which to make or obtain would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of

of each Company Option, (v) the vesting schedule and vested status of each
such award and (vi) whether it is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All Company
Options were granted under a Company Stock Plan and are evidenced by award
agreements, in each case in the forms made available by the Company to Parent,
and no award agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with or in
addition to such forms. Each grant of a Company Option was duly authorized no
later than the Grant Date of such award by all necessary corporate action,

the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that

definitive written amendment to this Agreement executed by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and delivered to the Company), the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ in light of such Superior Proposal giving rise to such
Superior Proposal Notice (or Proposal Amendment Notice) would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided, that in the event there is a
Company Board Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section_ __

have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parents
Representatives (if requested by Parent) any proposed modifications to the

and binding offer to modify the terms of this Agreement (which is set forth
in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement executed by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and delivered to the Company), the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event would
still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(a)_ to the contrary, the Company Board may not effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(e)_ until the expiration or waiver of the applicable notice period
set forth in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above, and unless and until the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after considering any proposed offer to
modify the terms of the Agreement from Parent (if any) and consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_ would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 



-59- 

    

(b) _Permitted Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board and/or any authorized committee
thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties; _provided_ that, in either such case, any such
statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board and/or any authorized
committee thereof will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the provisions of Article VIII, and shall not affect the
Companys and the Company Boards duties under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and
neither the Company nor the Company Board and/or any authorized committee
thereof may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change except in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

 

6.4 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the one hand,
nor Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public
release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant Party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party or Parties reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_
, that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not
apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the
Company in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any
action that would cause any "takeover" Law to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each of Parent and the Company shall (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" Law is or
becomes applicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action within their power to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company shall afford Parent, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants
and other agents and representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, Permits, Contracts, books
and records and personnel of the Company and furnish all other information
concerning the Company and its business, properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict
or otherwise

 



-60- 

    

 prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, or (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise
to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and
Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the applicable third party
that is required in order to disclose the applicable information and
otherwise communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would
not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a
privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or
create a material risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of
the Company. Any access to the properties of the Company shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of any applicable Lease and the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right
to perform Phase 1 or Phase 2 environmental assessments or other invasive
testing without the Companys prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent, its Subsidiaries, and their respective financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company,
or any Representatives of the Company to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information that are not otherwise prepared in
the ordinary course of business.

 

6.7 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ _Exemption_. The Company will take all actions as
may be required to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

6.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company under any and all (i) indemnification agreements
(A) listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.12(xiii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
between the Company and its current or former directors and officers and (B)
between the Company and any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (provided that any such indemnification agreement
entered into with any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company
following the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be in substantially the same form as the indemnification agreements listed in
_Section_ __ _ 3.12(xiii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the
"Indemnified Persons") and (ii) the indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporate

 



-61- 

    

 or bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company in effect on
the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses
that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, and during such six-year period,
such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Person except as required by applicable Law.

(b)  _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of, or
pertains directly or indirectly to any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director or officer of
the Company (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission) occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this  _Section_ __ _
6.8(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance, prior to the
final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for
which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following
request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by
such Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it
being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to
the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii)
subject to the receipt of the undertaking referred to in the preceding
sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after

 



-62- 

    

 statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent;
provided that such consent is not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) (A) shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under
this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all
liability arising out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (B)
shall be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) or (C) shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified Person shall promptly refund to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation the amount of all such expenses
theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less
favorable than those of the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _ however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300 percent amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance. In the event that the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d)  _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 



-63- 

    

(e) _No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. The obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person
(or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be joint and several.

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _401(k) Termination_. Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company
that such plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred
arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a "401(k) Plan") shall
not be terminated no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) Plans
maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, in each case effective as
of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the
same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code) as Parent (the "401(k) Termination Date"). The Company shall provide
Parent evidence that the 401(k) Plan(s) of the Company have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. If the 401(k) Plan(s) described
in this section have been terminated as of the 401(k) Termination Date,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit Continuing
Employees to roll over their account balances (but not loans) to a 401(k) Plan
of Parent or an Affiliate.

 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Acceptance Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, _provided_ , _however_ , __ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



-64- 

    

(c) _In-Cycle Bonuses_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay to each Continuing Employee otherwise eligible thereto,
their target bonus for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
pursuant to the Companys annual bonus plan (assuming 100% achievement of any
performance objectives and 100% achievement with respect to any individual
component for which no performance objectives were established), in the
amounts set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, which payments shall be paid to such Continuing Employees (i) at the
same time as annual bonuses are paid to the employees of the Parent for the
calendar year to which such annual bonuses relate. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 6.9(c)_ shall not require Parent to provide, or to cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, any Continuing Employee with a payment under
clause (ii) of this _Section 6.9(c)_ if such payment would result in the
Continuing Employee receiving a duplicate payment of his or her target bonus
for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs where such Continuing
Employee is entitled to the payment of such target bonus, or any portion
thereof, as a result of such Continuing Employees involuntarily terminated
under circumstances that entitle him or her to severance under any Employee
Plan set forth on _Section 3.16(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The
payments described in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_ shall represent the only
annual bonus entitlement to which any Continuing Employee shall be eligible
for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, and neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to include the Continuing
Employees in any annual bonus plan maintained by the Parent or Surviving
Corporation for the remainder of such year.

 

(d) _Employment; Benefits_. During the period commencing at the Acceptance
Time and ending one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide compensation, benefits and
severance benefits (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_, individual employment agreements) to each Continuing
Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the compensation, benefits and severance benefits (other than equity-
based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to similarly-
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. In each case, base salary
or hourly wage rates shall not be decreased from the levels set forth in the
material made available to Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.17(a)_ during
the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending one year following the
Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period.

 

(e) _New Plans_. With respect to the employee benefit plans maintained by
Parent and its Subsidiaries that are offered to the Continuing Employees
after the Effective Time (including any Employee Plans) (the "New Plans"), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and any
predecessor employer prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation, sick time or paid time off
accrual and severance pay entitlement) to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar 

 



-65- 

    

 Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result
in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Acceptance Time and/or immediately before the Effective
Time; (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee,
cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents; and (iii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Employee Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual
limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

(f) _No Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries to
terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii) require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue any Employee
Plan or New Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time. No provision of this Agreement
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee of the
Company, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which any of them may maintain, or otherwise. No provision of this Agreement
shall operate as an amendment to any benefit plan maintained by the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries.

 

6.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and until the Effective
Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or
arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to
which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, unless
prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the
Company Compensation Committee (each member of which the Company Board
determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of the applicable
NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any
such action) shall have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to
(a) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such
plan, program,

 



-66- 

    

 agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

6.11 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be jointly and
severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and discharge
any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to
this Agreement.

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII
and the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Acquisition Sub upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
set forth in _Sections 1.1(b)(iii)(B)_ and _1.1(b)(iii)(C)_ to fail to be
satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer and of the occurrence
of any Company Material Adverse Effect;  _provided_ that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the remedies available to the Parties or update any section
of the Company Disclosure Letter; and _provided further_ that the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_.

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the
Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set
forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies
available to the Parties or update any section of the Parent Disclosure
Letter; and _provided further_ that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_.

 



-67- 

    

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of (i)
any written notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any written notice
or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (iii) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company
or the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of such Partys
representations or warranties, as the case may be, or that relate to the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of any Party set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to
the Parties hereunder or update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable; provided, further, that the terms

will not be available to any Party that has failed to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement and such failure constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement.

 

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. The Party terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (other than pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(a)_) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties
setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_
pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and
circumstances forming the basis for such termination. Any valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ will be effective
immediately upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the
delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability
of any Party or Parties, as applicable (or any director, officer, employee,
affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party or Parties) to the
other Party or Parties, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Article IX and the definition of

termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing in this Agreement shall relieve
any Party or Parties, as applicable, from any liability or damages resulting
from any fraud or any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to
all remedies available at law or in equity. In addition to the foregoing, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees
and expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is consummated. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be

 



-71- 

    

 responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i)
transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real
property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of
or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger.

 

(b) _Company Payments_.

 

(i) In the event that: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ (provided that the Minimum
Condition has not been satisfied at the time of such termination and the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section_
__ _ 1.1(b)(iii)(A)_ have been satisfied at the time of such termination) or
by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_; (B) following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d) _a Competing
Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly announced or shall have
become publicly disclosed; and (C) within 12 months following the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)_, the Company enters into a Contract with any third party with respect
to any Competing Acquisition Transaction (which Competing Acquisition
Transaction is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such
12-month period) or any Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent, prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of such Competing
Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of only subclause (C) of the foregoing,
a "Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an
"Acquisition Transaction" except that all references in this Agreement to
"more than 20 percent" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f),_ the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent, as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within two Business Days) after such termination by Parent.

(c) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company
Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from
the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation; (iii) in the event that Parent shall receive the Company
Termination Fee, none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to

 



-72- 

    

 bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company
or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement (other than in the case
of fraud by the Company in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or a willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by the
Company) and (iv) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee, if, as and when
required to be paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ will not constitute
a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger; provided, that payment of
the Company Termination Fee shall not constitute liquidated damages in the
case of fraud by the Company in connection with the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or a willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 

(d) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof, then the Company
will pay or cause to be paid to Parent the reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) of Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection with such Legal Proceeding,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate
equal to the prime rate (as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus
five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 

(e) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

 

(ii) _For Parent_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable, to the extent owed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, and the
amounts described in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d),_ and Parents right to specific
performance pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Parent and Acquisition Sub against (A) the Company; and (B) the
former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Company and each of their respective
Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Company
Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger.
Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and any applicable amount
described in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_, none of the Company Related Parties will
have any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or Acquisition
Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger
(except that the Company (or its Affiliates) will remain obligated with
respect to, and Parent and Acquisition Sub may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, as applicable); provided, that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_ shall relieve the Company from any liabilities or damages resulting
from any fraud or willful and intentional breach of this Agreement prior to or
in connection with such termination.

 



-73- 

    

(f) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company will each be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in _Section_ __ _
9.11_, except that, although Parent, in its sole discretion, may determine
its choice of remedies under this Agreement, including by pursuing specific
performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of,  _Section_
__ _ 9.11_, under no circumstances will Parent, directly or indirectly, be
permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ (other than a grant of specific
performance ordering payment of the Company Termination Fee) and the Company
Termination Fee.

otherwise breached. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties
will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this

provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the
other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement,
and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement.

granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand;
and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties

enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security.

remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
9.11(b)_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.11(b)_ restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws

the negotiation hereof, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties
or assets, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or in such other manner
as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this _Section_ __ _
9.13_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event any
dispute or controversy arises out of or relating to this Agreement or the

Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal

Proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or the negotiation hereof in any court other than the

9.15 _Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter Matters_.

 

(a) _No Admission_. The information set forth in this Agreement, in the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter will
be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any
matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law or breach of Contract,
or (ii) that such information is material. Nothing in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter constitutes an admission against the
Companys or the Parents, as applicable, interest or represents the
Companys or the Parents, as applicable, legal position or legal rights on
the matter so disclosed. No reference in this Agreement to dollar amount
thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a Company Material Adverse Effect
or materiality.

(b) _Exceptions_. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any
particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company or the Parent, as
applicable, that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of
this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company or the Parent, as applicable, that
are set forth in this Agreement, but, in the case of this clause (ii), only if
the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

9.16  _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may
be executed in one or more textually identical counterparts, all of which will
be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery,
an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



-82- 

    

9.17 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent

(b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing
set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent
expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or
effect of any other provision of this Agreement.
