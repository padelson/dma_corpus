parte_ meetings, teleconferences or other correspondence with the
Accounting Firm.

  



  

(B) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to, as promptly as practicable following
the engagement of the Accounting Firm (but in any event within 30 calendar
days following such engagement), deliver to Buyer and to Seller a written
determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination, and such
determination to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting
Firm by Buyer and Seller and not by independent review or development) of
each Disputed Item, which determination (i) shall be within the range of
dispute between the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement
and the Objection Notice, such that the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed
Item claimed by any Party or less than the smallest value for such Disputed
Item claimed by any Party, (ii) shall be made strictly in accordance with the
accounting procedures set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 2.4(e)_
) without exception, and (iii) absent manifest error, shall be (1) the
exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to any disputes arising with
respect to the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Final Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Final Closing Cash or any adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price contemplated by _Section 2.4(d)_ , and (2) final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties, and judgment may be entered on such
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the Party against which such determination is to be enforced.

(C) The Accounting Firm shall only make determinations with respect
to the Disputed Items, provided that the scope of the disputes to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm shall in all cases be limited to whether the Closing
Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement and the amounts, calculations
and determinations therein (including of Closing Cash, Closing Current Assets,
Closing Current Liabilities and Closing Net Working Capital) were prepared
and performed in accordance with this Agreement (including _Section 2.4(e)_
) and whether there were mathematical errors contained in such statements,
calculations or determinations, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or
permitted to make any other determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as
to (i) whether GAAP was followed for the Financial Statements, (ii) whether
the Target Net Working Capital is correct, (iii) the accuracy of _Section
3.4_ or any other representation or warranty in this Agreement or (iv)
compliance by any Party with any of its covenants, agreements or obligations
in this Agreement (other than this _Section 2.4_ ). Any determinations by the
Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses performed by the Accounting Firm, in
connection with its resolution of any dispute under this _Section 2.4_ shall
not be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding between the
Parties other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations
under this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

(D) The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting
Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered with
respect to the Disputed Items.

  



  

(c) _Access_. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, make its
inventories, properties and facilities (in each case, of the Company
only), documents, books, records, personnel, accountants and advisors,
including the work papers prepared by Buyer or by any accountants retained by
Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital
and Closing Cash Statement, available to (i) Seller and its Representatives
and (ii) the Accounting Firm (if applicable), in each case at such times, and
to such extent, as may reasonably be requested by the Accounting Firm or by
Seller during the review by Seller or the Accounting Firm of, and
the resolution of any Objections with respect to, the Closing Net Working
Capital and Closing Cash Statement or the adjustments contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_ , provided that any Confidential Information so provided shall
be subject to _Section 6.11(b)_.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments_.

  



  

(i) If the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital (the aggregate amount of such excess being referred to herein
as the " _Final Net Working Capital Surplus_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company to, pay to Seller the amount equal to such Final Net Working
Capital Surplus in cash.

  



  

(ii) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital (the aggregate amount of such shortfall being referred to
herein as the " _Final Net Working Capital Deficiency_ "), Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount equal to such Final Net Working Capital Deficiency in cash.

  



  

(iii) If the Final Closing Cash exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to Seller the amount by which
the Final Closing Cash exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash.

(iv) If the Final Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing
Cash, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Final Closing Cash is
less than the Estimated Closing Cash.

  



  

(v) Amounts due from Seller to Buyer or from Buyer to Seller, as the
case may be, pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(i)_ , _Section 2.4(d)(ii)_ , 
_Section 2.4(d)(iii)_ and/or _Section 2.4(d)(iv)_ , shall be netted against or
added to each other, as the case may be, and the amount representing the
result of such netting or adding shall be paid by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)(vi)_.

  



  

(vi) Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days) pay to Seller any amounts determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(v)_
 to be due by Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Seller. Seller shall promptly (but in any
event within five Business Days) pay to Buyer any amounts determined pursuant
to _Section 2.4(d)(v)_  to be due by Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer.

  



  

(vii) Any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(vi)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price by the Parties for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

(e) _Accounting Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Exhibit B_ hereto sets forth a statement (the " _Reference
Statement_ ") prepared in good faith by Seller, in cooperation with Buyer,
setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and illustrating
as of December 31, 2014, the calculation of (A) Current Assets, (B) Current
Liabilities, (C) Net Working Capital, and (D) Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company, in each case prepared and calculated for the Company in accordance
with this Agreement and the Agreed Accounting Principles. For all
purposes hereunder, the Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Cash
Statement and Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement and all
determinations and calculations by any Person (including the Accounting Firm)
of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Current Assets, Current Liabilities or any Net
Working Capital Amount shall in all circumstances be prepared and calculated
strictly in accordance with the manner of determination and calculation (as
applicable) as shown on the Reference Statement using the same line
items, accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods
(with consistent classifications, judgments, elections,
inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and
applied in preparing the Reference Statement without deviation or exception
in any manner, or for any reason, whatsoever; provided that such calculations
and determinations: (1) shall not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (2) shall follow the defined terms contained in this
Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with GAAP and (3)
shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a
pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month.

  



  

(ii) The Parties agree that:

  



  

(A) Following the Closing Date through the date on which payment, if
any, is made by any Party pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ , or if the
Parties agree that no such payment is required, on the date of such
determination, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any
actions with respect to the accounting records, books, policies or procedures
of the Company on which the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Cash
Statement (including the determinations and calculations therein) or
calculation of Final Net Working Capital or Final Closing Cash are to be
based that are not consistent with the Company's past practices in all
material respects or that would make it impracticable to calculate Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Final Net Working Capital or Final Closing
Cash in the manner contemplated by this Agreement.

  



    

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(B) In no event shall any actions taken by Buyer or the Company
following the Closing with respect to the accounting records, books,
policies or procedures of the Company on which the Closing Net Working
Capital and Closing Cash Statement or calculation of Final Net
Working Capital or Final Closing Cash are to be based that are not consistent
with the Agreed Accounting Principles (including but not limited to changes
in any reserve, allowance or other account, any changes in methodology for
inventory valuation or accounting or any reclassification of any asset) have
any effect on, or be considered in, the preparation of the Closing Net Working
Capital and Closing Cash Statement (including the determinations and
calculations contained therein) or the calculation of Final Net
Working Capital or Final Closing Cash.

  



  

(C) The Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement, the
Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement and the
respective determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated without regard to any changes in GAAP made or taking
effect after the date that the Reference Statement was prepared.

  



  

(D) Without exception, the Target Net Working Capital shall not be
subject to change (including by the Accounting Firm), regardless of
whether the items or amounts included therein were recorded in accordance
with GAAP.

  



  

(E) The determinations of Closing Net Working Capital and Final Net
Working Capital, and the resulting payment of any adjustment contemplated by
_Section 2.4(d)_ , are intended solely to reflect changes between Final Net
Working Capital and Target Net Working Capital, and any such change can be
measured only if the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Statement
and the calculations and determinations therein (including of Closing Current
Assets, Closing Current Liabilities and Closing Net Working Capital) are
prepared using the same line items, accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications, judgments,
elections inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies)
as were used and applied in connection with the preparation of the Reference
Statement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Base Purchase Price Allocation_. For U.S. federal,
state, local, and non-U.S. tax purposes, the Base Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company using their fair market values as
of the Closing Date in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code.
Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith to determine the allocation
and Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth a
proposed allocation within 120 days after the Closing Date. Buyer's schedule
shall be based on values determined by an independent appraisal of the
Company's assets, a copy of which appraisal shall be provided by Buyer to
Seller. To the extent agreed by the parties the proposed allocation shall be
used for purposes of filing any applicable Tax forms and all Tax Returns
filed by each of them (unless otherwise required by Law); provided that Seller
acknowledges that Buyer may be required to use a different allocation for
financial reporting purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, if the parties are
unable to resolve any differences regarding the proposed allocation each Party
shall be free to adopt its own allocation. Buyer and Seller agree to promptly
provide each other with any other information required to complete any
applicable Tax forms.

favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company, as
provided in the Company's Governing Documents or otherwise in effect as of

continue in full force and effect and that the Company on its own behalf will
perform and discharge the Company's obligations to provide such indemnity and
exculpation. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such
indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and the applicable

insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who are covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as of the
date hereof or at the Closing, for a period of six years following the
Closing Date with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing that is
at least equal to the coverage provided under the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies; provided that Seller may permit
the Company to substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing
Date. The fees and expenses of such tail policy (including brokerage fees and
commissions) shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer, provided that if
Buyer has not paid for its 50% of such fees prior to Closing, then Buyer's
obligation for such amount shall be satisfied by increasing the amount of
Closing Cash (and Estimated Closing Cash) by such amount.

  



  

(c) The current and former directors, officers, employees and agents
of the Company entitled to the indemnification, liability
limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 6.6_ are

6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer.

  



  

(d) Buyer agrees to pay, or to cause the Company to pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be incurred by the

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made prior to or concurrently with the

during normal business hours of the applicable Company, upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable notice.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to,
and shall not (and shall not permit any of its Representatives or Affiliates

Section 6.12 _Tax Covenants_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax with respect
to the income, property or operations of the Company that is attributable to
any Tax period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") will be apportioned between the period
of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the
Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the
Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end
of the Straddle Period in accordance with this _Section 6.12(a)_. The portion
of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (i) in the
case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes,
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment
taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income,
receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Except to the extent attributable to any Tax attribute or other
Tax benefit generated after the Closing Date, Seller will be entitled to any
refunds or credits for overpayment of Taxes of the Company attributable to or
arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Period (to the extent such Taxes were paid by
the Company or Seller). Buyer will cause the Company to forward to Seller or
to reimburse Seller for any such refunds or credits due to Seller promptly,
and in any event within ten days, after receipt or realization thereof, net
of any reasonable costs, increased Taxes attributable to obtaining such
refunds or credits of Taxes or required Tax withholdings. For the avoidance
of doubt, refunds or credits of Taxes shall include any amounts owed or
otherwise payable by a Governmental Authority pursuant to any claim for
refund or amended Tax Return, but shall only be reimbursed to Seller upon
receipt or realization. To the extent such refund or credits of Taxes are
subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable
Governmental Authority, Seller agrees to promptly repay the amount of such
refund or credit for overpayment, together with any interest, penalties or
other additional amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority, to Buyer. In
addition, Buyer or the Company shall refund to Seller any amounts deducted
from the Purchase Price through Net Working Capital for any Taxes for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (such deducted Taxes " _Current Period Taxes_ ") that are
not due and owing after the Closing Date. Buyer or the Company shall provide
to Seller evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller of the payment of all
Current Period Taxes to a taxing authority.

  



  

(c) Buyer covenants that all material Tax Returns required to be
filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period will be filed by the Company when due (taking into
account any extension of a required filing date).

  



  

(d) Unless required by applicable Law, Buyer covenants that it will
not, nor will it cause or permit the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer to
make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any Tax position
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period on any Tax Return with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or, without the prior written consent of Seller not to
be unreasonably denied, take any action outside of the ordinary course of
business (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not preclude Buyer or the
Company from taking any position on a Tax Return filed for a taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date that is inconsistent with positions taken by
the Company on Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing), in each case that
could reasonably be expected to increase any Tax liability of Seller or any
of its Affiliates, including for this purpose, the Company, in respect of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(e) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance (including access to books and records) relating to the Company as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation
for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Buyer and Seller agree to
retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the
Company until the applicable period for assessment under applicable Law
(giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to
abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority. Buyer agrees to give Seller reasonable
notice prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and
records relating to Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax matters and, if Seller so
requests, Buyer shall allow Seller to take possession of such books and
records at Seller's sole expense. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the Company
for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
subsection.

  



  

(f) Seller has notified Buyer that (i) as a result of the Company's
treatment as a disregarded entity for federal and state income tax purposes,
the income of the Company has been included in Seller's federal and state
income tax returns during the tax periods that Seller has owned the Company,
(ii) Seller's federal and state income tax returns during such tax periods
have reflected no material income and deductions other than the income and
deduction associated with Seller's ownership and financing of the Interests,
and (iii) the Company and its outside accountants have performed substantially
all of the work associated with preparing Seller's federal and state income
tax returns during such tax periods. Following the Closing, the Company shall
provide reasonable assistance to Seller, at Seller's sole expense for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer or the Company, in connection with
preparation of Seller's federal and state income tax returns for the tax
period that includes the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) This  _Section 6.12(g)_ and not _Section 9.4_ shall control any
inquiry, assessment, Proceeding or other similar event relating to Taxes of
the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Tax Matter_ "). Seller, at
Seller's sole expense, shall have the right to represent the interests of the
Company before the relevant Governmental Authority solely with respect to any
Tax Matter relating to income taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than
any Straddle Period) and shall have the right to control the defense,
compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, including responding to
inquiries and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes
of, or relating to, such Tax Matter; provided that (i) Buyer shall have the
right to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by Seller, and (ii) Seller
shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax
Matter without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. For all other Tax Matters
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall have the right to control
the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter; provided
that (i) Seller shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel
employed by Buyer, and (ii)Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of or
otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, or
delayed.

  



  

(h) For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made
under this _Section 6.12_ as adjustments to the Base Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by Law.

liability after the Closing.

of any Party hereto or its Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders,
other than liability of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for any
intentional and willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination; provided that a failure of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in breach of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
intentional and willful if Buyer does not have sufficient funds available to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In determining losses or
damages recoverable upon termination by a Party hereto for another Party's
breach, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages

any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of (a) any inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty made by the Company contained in _ARTICLE 3_ , by Seller
contained in _ARTICLE 4_ , or in the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer for the Benefit of Seller_.
Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ , from and after the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify, defend and
hold Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), officers, directors,

Section 9.4 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section
9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying
party (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be Seller in the
event of a claim made under  _Section 9.2_ ) (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the
claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it by a third party
(each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing the claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof. Any Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise
to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense,
and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by
appointing a counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense; provided that any Indemnitor shall
continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained
herein; provided further that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose; provided that the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor shall control the
defense of any such Third Party Claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled
to settle such Third Party Claim; provided the Indemnitor shall not be
permitted, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to enter into
any settlement of a Third Party Claim or cease to defend such Third Party
Claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or
if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim,
without prejudice except for payments that would be required to be paid by
Buyer representing the Deductible. In no event will an Indemnitee consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor.

  



  

(b) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any such third party claim in respect of which indemnity may
be sought hereunder and each of Buyer and Seller (or a duly authorized
Representative of such Party) shall (and shall cause the Company to) furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

  



  

(c) In the event any Indemnitee has a claim for indemnification
under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ which it determines to assert and that
does not constitute a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall assert such
claim by delivering a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor promptly after
becoming aware of such claim.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Additional Limitations on Indemnification
Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
in addition to any other limitations provided herein, the rights of the Buyer
Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ are subject to the following
limitations:

  



    

47 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) the amount of any Loss shall be calculated net of (i) the Deemed
Tax Benefit and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of direct
collection expenses) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
received by the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto. For
purposes hereof, the " _Deemed Tax Benefit_ " shall mean 5% of the amount of
the portion of any Loss that is deductible by Buyer or the Company in the
taxable year of the Loss. The Indemnitee shall seek full recovery under all
insurance policies covering any Loss. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor;

  



  

(b) the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnitee and its affiliates in respect of any Losses indemnified by the
Indemnitor;

  



  

(c) the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ for any Loss underlying
any such indemnification claim to the extent that:

  



  

(i) prior to the date hereof, the Company provided for or recorded a
reserve in its books and records (including any such provision or
reserve reflected on a balance sheet included in the Financial Statements or
on the Reference Statement) with respect to the matter giving rise to the
Loss, including in a general category of items or matters similar in nature to
the specific items or matters giving rise to such Loss,

  



  

(ii) such Loss was taken into account in the calculation of Closing
Current Liabilities or in the determination of the Base Purchase
Price (including any adjustment thereto contemplated by _Section 2.4(d)_ )
pursuant to _ARTICLE 2_ , or

  



  

(iii) such Loss arises as a result of a change after the Closing in
any accounting principle, method or policy (including any change in GAAP or
application thereof) (provided that for the avoidance of doubt, any such
change may only be made in compliance with the provisions hereof, including
_Section 2.4(e)_ );

  



  

(d) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ for any Loss if Buyer (or any director or officer
of Buyer or its Affiliates) had knowledge at or as of the Closing of the
Circumstances constituting or resulting in the breach (alleged or otherwise)
of the representation, warranty or covenant giving rise to such Loss;

  



  

(e) no claim shall be brought or maintained by any Buyer Indemnitee
or Seller Indemnitee against any officer, director, employee (present or
former) or Affiliate of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified
as a Party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any Party hereto
set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or Schedule hereto or
any certificate delivered hereunder, provided, that the provisions of this
Section 9.5(e) shall not apply to any officer, director, employee
or Affiliate of any Party that commits fraud; and

  



  

(f) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for all
purposes hereunder the term "Loss" shall not include any consequential
damages (including loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or diminution in
value of assets or securities) or punitive, special, exemplary or indirect
damages, except, in each case, to the extent required to be paid by an
Indemnitee to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim, and no
"multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other valuation
methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses.

Section 9.6 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification owed to a
Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 9.2_ shall, at any time prior to the
Escrow Termination Date and to the extent of available funds, be satisfied
from the funds held in the Escrow Fund (and Buyer and Seller shall promptly
execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly release the applicable amount of
such funds to the Indemnitee). Following the Escrow Termination Date, or at
any time (whether before, on or after the Escrow Termination Date) that the
funds held in the Escrow Fund are insufficient to satisfy any
indemnification owed to a Buyer Indemnitee, Seller shall promptly, but in any
event within five Business Days, make the applicable payment by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. Any
indemnification owed to a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 9.3_ shall
be paid by Buyer (or the Company, at the direction of Buyer) promptly, but in
any event within five Business Days by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Seller.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ shall
be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law, and such agreed treatment shall govern for
purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (a) in the case where a
Party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to _Section 10.20_ , (b)
for the purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(d)_
and (c) for claims arising out of or in connection with fraud, from and after
the Closing the rights of the Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the
Parties hereto with respect to any matter in any way arising from or
relating to (i) this Agreement or its subject matter or (ii) any other matter
relating to the Company prior to the Closing, the operation of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing, or any other transaction or state
of facts relating to the Company prior to the Closing, in each case
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law
or in equity, or otherwise, and the Parties hereby agree that the
Buyer Indemnitees shall have no remedy or recourse with respect to any of the
foregoing other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
this _ARTICLE 9_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer Indemnitees may
not avoid such limitation on liability by (1) seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which
are hereby waived or (2) asserting or threatening any claim against any
Person that is not a Party hereto (or a successor to a Party hereto) for
breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating
to indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer's and the Buyer
Indemnitees' and Seller's and the Seller Indemnitees' remedies with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to
be paid to Seller hereunder. Subject to the foregoing and the additional
procedures for bringing or resolving disputes as specifically provided in
_ARTICLE 10_ , to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereby
waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any matter in any way
relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith, whether under
any Laws at common law, in equity or otherwise.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Acknowledgment of Buyer_. Buyer understands,
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
made by the Company in _ARTICLE 3_ and Seller in _ARTICLE 4_ , the Company
and Seller expressly disclaim any representations or warranties of any kind
or nature, whether written or oral, express or implied, as to Seller, the
Company or the condition, value or quality of the securities or businesses or
assets of the Company. In connection with Buyer's investigation of Seller and
the Company, Buyer has received certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company
and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans and that Buyer is responsible for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts.
Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges that none of Seller, the Company or
any other Person is making any representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts.  Except as set forth in this Agreement (including _ARTICLE 9_ ) or
in any Ancillary Document, Buyer agrees that none of Seller, the Company or
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, any
such information, including the Company Overview/Confidential Informational
Presentation dated March 2014 prepared by William Blair and Company, and any
information, document or material made available to Buyer or its Affiliates
in any "data room," management presentations or any other form in expectation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.7 _Construction; Section Headings; Draftsmanship;
Interpretation_. The term "this Agreement" means this Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement together with the Disclosure Schedule and exhibits hereto,
as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or
restated in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. The headings
contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party,
nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for
purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly
for or against any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein
by the context or use thereof: (a) the words, "herein," "hereto,"
"hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole,
including the Disclosure Schedule and exhibits hereto, and not to any
particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in
this Agreement; (b) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and
neutral genders, and vice versa; (c) words importing the singular shall also
include the plural, and vice versa; (d) the words "include," "includes" or
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(e) a term has the meaning assigned to it; (f) "or" is not exclusive; (g) all
references in this Agreement to designated "Articles," "Sections,"
"paragraphs," "clauses" and other subdivisions are to the designated
Articles, Sections, paragraphs, clauses and other subdivisions of this

to any agreement, instrument, document, statute or regulation herein shall be
construed as referring to such agreement, instrument, document, statute or
regulation as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
(subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements or modifications
set forth herein).

  



  

Section 10.8 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedule and
all exhibits and documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement and made a part hereof as if set out
in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any part, subpart, section
or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule referenced by a particular section or
subsection in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with
respect to every other section and subsection in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is
reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-
reference. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts or other items, are or are not material,
and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts in any dispute
or controversy as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Any item of information, matter or document disclosed or
referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure Schedule shall not (a) be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement or to establish a standard of
materiality, (b) represent a determination that such item or matter did not
arise in the ordinary course of business, (c) be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of any Party's representations and warranties, obligations,
covenants, conditions or agreements contained herein, (d) constitute, or be
deemed to constitute, an admission of liability or obligation regarding such
matter, (e) represent a determination that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement requires the consent of any third
party, (f) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission to any third
party concerning such item or matter or (g) constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, an admission or indication by Seller that such item meets any or
all of the criteria set forth in this Agreement for inclusion in the
Disclosure Schedule. No reference in the Disclosure Schedule to any Contract
or other agreement or document shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such Contract, agreement or document is enforceable or
currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining to be
performed or any rights that may be exercised under such Contract, agreement
or document. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

Section 10.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except as provided in the following sentence of this
_Section 10.9_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, (a) the former officers and directors of the Company shall be
third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.6_ , (b)
the Indemnitees shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions
set forth in _ARTICLE 9_ , and (c) Schiff shall be a third party beneficiary
of the provisions set forth in _Section 10.21_.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction, and all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Counterparts; Delivery_. This Agreement may be
executed in multiple original, PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which taken together shall be
considered one and the same agreement. Each executed signature page to
this Agreement and to each agreement and certificate delivered by a Party
pursuant to this Agreement may be delivered by any of the methods described
in _Section 10.4_ hereof, including via facsimile or e-mail, provided that
such delivery is effected in accordance with the notice information provided
for in _Section 10.4_ hereof. In the event that any signature to this
Agreement or any agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, or any
amendment thereof, is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
".pdf" signature page were an original thereof. No Party shall raise the use
of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to
deliver any such signature page or the fact that such signature was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Knowledge_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the
phrase "to the knowledge of the Company" and any derivations thereof
shall mean, as of the applicable date, the actual knowledge (and shall in no
event encompass constructive, imputed or similar concepts of knowledge) of
those persons identified on _Schedule 10.12_ , none of whom shall have any
personal liability or obligations regarding such knowledge.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Limitation on Remedies_. No breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part
of Buyer or Seller, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that
no recourse under this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document shall be had against any current or future equityholder, partner,
member, controlling person, director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, Representative or Affiliate of Seller (or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing) (each, a " _Nonparty Affiliate_ "), whether by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any
Nonparty Affiliate for any obligation of Seller under this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document, any documents or instruments delivered in connection with
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, or any transaction contemplated by
the foregoing, for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations or their creation.

  



  

Section 10.15 _Dispute Resolution for Direct Claims_. In the event
of a Dispute (provided that for the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.15_
 shall not be applicable with respect to the defense or control _vis-a-vis_ a
third party with respect to a third party claim subject to the provisions of
_Section 9.4)_ and the Party receiving a Notice of Claim relating to such
Dispute disputes all or any part of such Notice of Claim, Buyer and Seller
shall first attempt to resolve such Dispute through direct negotiations. Any
Party may initiate this process by making a written demand for direct
negotiation that describes the Dispute to be negotiated in reasonable detail.
At either Party's election, such direct negotiations may be held
telephonically or in person. No settlement reached in such negotiations under
this _Section 10.15_ shall be binding until reduced to a writing signed by the
applicable Parties. If the Dispute is not resolved within 20 Business Days
after the date of the demand for direct negotiation, then Seller and/or Buyer
shall resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section 10.16_. Nothing in this
_Section 10.15_ shall prevent any Party from seeking injunctive relief under
_Section 10.20_ (which injunctive relief, for the avoidance of doubt, may
be sought prior to complying with this _Section 10.15_ ).

  



  

Section 10.16 _Arbitration_. The Parties agree that the dispute
resolution provisions in _Section 10.15_ and the arbitration procedure set
forth in this  _Section 10.16_ shall be the sole and exclusive methods for
resolving and remedying Disputes (provided that for the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 10.16_ shall not be applicable with respect to the defense or
control _vis-a-vis_ a third party with respect to a third party claim subject
to the provisions of _Section 9.4_ ). The Parties agree and acknowledge that,
except as otherwise provided in this _Section 10.16_ or in the Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the Expedited Procedures in those Rules
of JAMS, as in effect from time to time, the arbitration procedures and any
Final Determination hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be enforced
pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act of the State of Delaware.

  



  

(a) If no resolution of a Dispute is reached within 20 Business Days
after the date of the demand for direct negotiation pursuant to
_Section 10.15_ , the Party delivering such demand (the " _Disputing Person_
") may, within 45 Business Days after delivery of such notice, commence
arbitration hereunder by delivering to each other Party involved therein a
notice of arbitration (a " _Notice of Arbitration_ "). Such Notice of
Arbitration shall specify the matters as to which arbitration is sought, the
nature of any Dispute and the claims of each party to the arbitration, and
shall specify the amount and nature of any Losses, if any, sought to be
recovered as a result of any alleged claim, and any other matters required by
the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the Expedited
Procedures in those Rules of JAMS, as in effect from time to time, to be
included therein, if any.

  



    

54

(b) Buyer and Seller shall each select one independent arbitrator
expert in the subject matter of the Dispute (the arbitrators so
selected shall be referred to herein as " _Buyer 's Arbitrator_" and "
_Seller 's Arbitrator_," respectively). In the event that either such Party
fails to select an independent arbitrator as set forth herein within 10
days from delivery of a Notice of Arbitration, then the matter shall be
resolved by the arbitrator selected by the other Party. Seller's Arbitrator
and Buyer's Arbitrator shall select a third independent arbitrator expert in
the subject matter of the dispute, and the three arbitrators so selected
shall resolve the matter according to the procedures set forth in this
_Section 10.16_. If Seller's Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator are unable to
agree on a third arbitrator within 10 days after their selection, Buyer's
Arbitrator and Seller's Arbitrator shall each prepare a list of three
independent arbitrators. Buyer's Arbitrator and Seller's Arbitrator shall
each have the opportunity to designate as objectionable and eliminate one
arbitrator from the other arbitrator's list within seven days after
submission thereof, and the third arbitrator shall then be selected by lot
from the arbitrators remaining on the lists submitted by Buyer's Arbitrator
and Seller's Arbitrator.

  



  

(c) The arbitrator(s) selected pursuant to this _Section 10.16_ will
determine the allocation of the costs and expenses of arbitration based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if
Buyer submits a claim for $1,000, and if Seller contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Buyer, and if the arbitrators ultimately resolve the
dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Seller and
40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Buyer.

  



  

(d) The arbitration shall be conducted in the State of New York
under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the
Expedited Procedures in those Rules of JAMS as in effect from time to time,
except as modified by the agreement of Buyer and Seller. The arbitrator(s)
shall so conduct the arbitration that a final result, determination, finding,
judgment and/or award (the " _Final Determination_ ") is made or rendered as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 Business Days after the
delivery of the Notice of Arbitration. The Final Determination must be agreed
upon and signed by the sole arbitrator, if only one arbitrator conducted the
arbitration, or by at least two of the three arbitrators that conducted the
arbitration (as the case may be). The Final Determination shall be final and
binding on all Parties and there shall be no appeal from or reexamination of
the Final Determination, except for fraud, perjury or misconduct by the sole
arbitrator or at least two of the arbitrator(s) if more than one
prejudicing the rights of any Party and except to correct manifest clerical
errors. A Final Determination may be enforced in any state or federal court
having jurisdiction over the Dispute.

  



  

(e) The Parties shall keep confidential all awards in arbitration,
together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the
arbitration and all other documents produced by another Party in the
arbitration proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the
extent disclosure is required by law, legal process, regulation or judicial
order by any Governmental Authority, or to protect or pursue a legal right or
to enforce or challenge an award in Law before a court or other judicial
authority permitted by this _Section 10.16_.

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section
10.16_ shall not be applicable to the determination of claims or
disputes that are not Disputes, and a proceeding with respect to any such
claim or dispute that is not a Dispute may be brought to any court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with and pursuant to _Section 10.17_ to
resolve such claim or dispute without complying with this _Section 10.16_.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any Party from seeking provisional
measures from any court of competent jurisdiction, and any such request shall
not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the
right to arbitrate.

  



  

Section 10.17 _Court Proceedings; Jurisdiction_. For the purpose of
any Proceeding instituted with respect to the enforcement of any Final
Determination, the enforcement of any determination made by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , the enforcement of _Section 10.20_ , or any
proceeding otherwise permitted to be instituted under _Section 10.15_ or
_Section 10.16_ , each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Delaware Chancery Court or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware, in any such Proceeding, agrees that all claims in respect of any
such Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating thereto in any
other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any such Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect
thereto.

Section 10.18 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, FOR ANY PROCEEDING WHICH IS
PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO BE FILED IN A COURT, EACH PARTY HEREBY
EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN SUCH
PROCEEDING, INCLUDING THOSE PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT,
CONSENT, WAIVER, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN
THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THEM OR ARISING FROM ANY
RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE
MATTERS SHALL BE TRIED TO A COURT AND NOT TO A JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section_ _ 10.18_.

  



  

Section 10.19 _Service of Process_. Each Party irrevocably consents
to the service of summons and complaint and any other process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 10.17_ hereof
in any Proceeding by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party
to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 10.4_ hereof (except that email or facsimile
shall not be permitted delivery means pursuant to this _Section 10.19_ ).
Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.20 _Specific Enforcement_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or
conferred by Law or equity, upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (without any requirement to post any bond or other security in
connection with seeking such relief), in addition to any other remedy to
which any Party is entitled at law or in equity, exclusively in the Delaware
Chancery Court and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other
court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware). The Parties agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, and to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by Buyer, on the other hand, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties
have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

(a) _Acknowledgement of Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the Parties that the Company and Seller have retained Schiff Hardin LLP ("
_Schiff_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (the "
_Current Representation_ "), and that no other Party to this Agreement has the
status of a client of Schiff for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof..

  



  

(b) _Affirmation of Representation_. Buyer and the Company hereby
agree that Schiff may represent Seller or any officer, director, manager,
employee, shareholder, partner or member of Seller or the Company (any such
Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving or arising from
the Current Representation, including any interpretation or application of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, and including for the avoidance of
doubt any litigation, arbitration, dispute or mediation between or among
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, and any Designated
Person, even though the interests of such Designated Person may be directly
adverse to Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, and even
though Schiff may have represented the Company in a substantially related
matter, or may be representing the Company in ongoing matters.

  



  

(c) _Waiver of Conflict_. Buyer and the Company hereby waive and
agree not to assert (i) any claim that Schiff has a conflict of interest in
any representation described in _Section 10.21(b)_ above, and (ii) any
confidentiality obligation with respect to any communication between Schiff
and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation.

  



  

(d) _Retention of Privilege_. Buyer and the Company hereby agree
that as to all communications (whether before, at or after the Closing)
between Schiff and any Designated Person that relate in any way to the
Current Representation, the attorney-client privilege and all rights to any
other evidentiary privilege, and the protections afforded to information
relating to representation of a client under applicable rules of professional
conduct, belong to such Designated Person and may be controlled by such
Designated Person and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the
Company. Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any policy of Buyer
or the Company or any agreement between the Company and any Designated Person
or any Representative of any Designated Person or the Company,
whether established or entered into before, at or after the Closing, neither
Buyer nor the Company may review or use for any purpose without such
Designated Person's written consent, or seek to compel disclosure to Buyer or
the Company (or any of their Representatives) any communication or
information (whether written, oral, electronic or in any other medium)
described in the previous sentence.

  



  

(e) _Further Assurances_. Buyer and the Company agree to take, and
to cause their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to
implement the intent of this _Section 10.21_. Buyer, Seller and the Company
further agree that Schiff and its partners and employees are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.21_.

  



  

Section 10.22 _Guarantee of Obligations of Buyer by Buyer Parent_.
For valuable consideration and as an inducement to Seller to enter into this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which Seller is a party and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, Buyer Parent hereby:

  



  

(a) irrevocably, unconditionally, absolutely and continually
guarantees to Seller (the " _Guarantee_ ") the due, punctual and
full performance by Buyer of all of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents to which Buyer is or will be a party (the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ ");

(b) promises and undertakes to make all payments to be made under,
and to otherwise perform, the Guaranteed Obligations free and clear of
any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind (other than
defenses to the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations that are
available to Buyer under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, except for
defenses (the " _Specified Defenses_ ") arising out of any bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, or any other law relating to
the enforcement of creditor's rights);

  



  

(c) agrees that if Buyer is in breach of any Guaranteed Obligation,
then Seller may at any time and from time to time, at Seller's option, and so
long as Buyer remains in breach of any Guaranteed Obligation, take any and all

applicable Law, to collect on or enforce Buyer Parent's liabilities and
obligations under this _Section 10.22_ in respect of such Guaranteed
Obligations;

  



  

(d) agrees that Seller may, in its sole discretion, bring and
prosecute a separate action or actions against Buyer Parent for the full
amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, regardless of whether any action is
brought against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in any such action or
actions, and that Seller shall not be required to pursue any right or remedy
it may have against Buyer or to obtain any judgment against Buyer to enforce
the Guarantee;

  



  

(e) agrees that the obligations of Buyer Parent hereunder shall not
be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i)
the failure or delay on the part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to
enforce any right or remedy against Buyer; (ii) any change in the time, place
or manner of payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document made in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof or
any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with
any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release
of any entity or other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document; (iv) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or any other Person interested in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting
Buyer or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document; (vi) the existence of any claim, set-off
or other right which Buyer Parent may have at any time against Buyer, whether
in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise (other than
defenses to the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations that are
available to Buyer under this Agreement); or (vii) the adequacy of any
means Seller may have of obtaining payment or performance related to the
Guaranteed Obligations;

  



  

(f) waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this
Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (other
than notices expressly required to be provided to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium law or other similar applicable Law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than

(g) agrees that (i) no failure on the part of Seller to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power under the
Guarantee shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by Seller of any right, remedy or power under the Guarantee preclude
any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power under the
Guarantee, (ii) each and every right, remedy and power granted by the
Guarantee to Seller or allowed it by applicable Law or other agreement shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Seller
at any time or from time to time, (iii) Seller shall not have any obligation
to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of
Seller's rights against, Buyer or any other Person liable for any Guaranteed
Obligations prior to proceeding against Buyer Parent under the Guarantee, (iv)
the insolvency, bankruptcy or dissolution of Buyer shall not relieve Buyer
Parent of its obligations under the Guarantee, and (v) Buyer Parent shall pay
to Seller, upon demand, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by Seller in connection with the
enforcement of its rights under this _Section 10.22_ ;

  



  

(h) acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits; and

  



  

(i) agrees that the Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated, and
will remain in full force and effect and will be binding on Buyer Parent and
its successors and permitted assigns, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
have been satisfied in full

  



  

Section 10.23 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
