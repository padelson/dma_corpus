iii    STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the
"Agreement") is entered into as of October  --------- 10, 2000, by and
between Kent Electronics Corporation, a Texas corporation (the "Seller"), and
Thayer-BLUM Funding II, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability  ------ company
(the "Purchaser").  ---------    RECITALS    WHEREAS, the Seller is the
owner of 1,000 shares of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
$.01 par value per share (the "Common  ------ Stock"), of K*TEC Electronics
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and such Common Stock
constitutes all of the issued and outstanding  ------- capital stock (of all
classes) of the Company;    WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to purchase from
the Seller, and the Seller desires to sell to the Purchaser, all such shares
of Common Stock (the "Shares")  ------ upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein;    WHEREAS, the Seller is making certain representations,
warranties, covenants and indemnities herein as an inducement to the
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, and the Purchaser is making certain
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities herein as an
inducement to the Seller to enter into this Agreement; and    WHEREAS,
capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in Section 8.17.  ------------    NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:    ARTICLE I  TRANSFER
OF REAL PROPERTY; SALE OF SHARES; CLOSING   SECTION 1.1 Transfer of Real
Property and Other Assets.  ------------------------------------------  
(a) Transfer of Real Property and Leases. Before the transfer of the 
------------------------------------ Shares to the Purchaser in accordance
with Section 1.2, the Seller has  ----------- transferred to the Company
good and indefeasible title to the real property (and any improvements
thereon) described on Schedule 1.1 (the "Transferred Real  ------------
---------------- Property") pursuant to the Deeds (as defined below), and the
Seller has assigned -------- to the Company the contracts and leases
described on Schedule 1.1 (the "Assigned  ------------ -------- Contracts
and Leases") pursuant to the Assignment (as defined
below). --------------------   (b) Drop Down of Assets. After the transfer
of the Transferred Real  ------------------- Property and Assigned Contracts
and Leases described in Section 1.1(a) and  -------------- before the
transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser in accordance with Section 
------- 1.2, the Company has transferred to one or more ---   non-
corporate Company subsidiaries, all of which are directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by the Company and have not conducted business prior
to the transfers of the assets contemplated by this Section 1.1(b)
(collectively, the  -------------- "Non-Corporate Subsidiaries"), certain of
its assets (the "Asset Drop Down").  ---------------------------
---------------   SECTION 1.2 Purchase of Shares. Subject to the terms and
conditions of  ------------------ this Agreement, the Seller hereby sells to
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser hereby purchases from the Seller, all of the
Seller\'s right, title and interest in the Shares on the Closing Date (as
defined below).   SECTION 1.3 Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this  -------------- Agreement, and as consideration for the
Shares, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the aggregate sum of
$225,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase  -------------- Price
shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller as follows: (i) at the Closing
(as defined below), the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller $175,000,000, less
any amount previously or contemporaneously paid to the Seller from the funds
held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, and (ii) at the Closing, the Purchaser, as
maker, shall execute and deliver to the Seller, as payee, the note in the
original principal amount of $50,000,000 attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Note"), and  --------- ---- the Note shall be secured by the execution and
delivery of a deed of trust (the "Deed of Trust") and one or more security
agreements (collectively, the  ------------- "Security Agreement"), and
guaranteed by the execution and delivery of a  ------------------ Guaranty
(the "Guaranty"), each executed by the Company or one or more of the 
-------- Non-Corporate Subsidiaries in favor of the Seller. The Purchase
Price shall be adjusted after the Closing Date in accordance with Section
1.4.  -----------   SECTION 1.4 Purchase Price Adjustment. 
-------------------------   (a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted in the
amount equal to the Net Asset Adjustment. For purposes hereof, the "Net Asset
Adjustment" shall equal  -------------------- the difference of (i) the
Closing Net Assets (as defined in Section 1.4(d)) as  -------------- of
11:59 p.m. on October 7, 2000 minus (ii) $177,000,000 (the "Net Asset 
--------- Threshold"). If the Net Asset Adjustment is positive (i.e., Closing
Net Assets --------- are greater than the Net Asset Threshold), the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of the Net Asset Adjustment. Any such
positive Net Asset Adjustment shall be paid by the execution and delivery by
the Purchaser to the Seller within five days of the Determination Date (as
defined below) of a note in the original principal amount of the Net Asset
Adjustment, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Adjustment Note"),
which shall bear interest  --------- --------------- at the Stated Rate (as
defined in the Note) from the Closing Date and shall be guaranteed by the
Company and one or more of its Non-Corporate Subsidiaries under the Guaranty.
If the Net Asset Adjustment is negative (i.e., if Closing Net Assets are less
than the Net Asset Threshold), the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount of the Net Asset Adjustment. Any such negative Net Asset Adjustment
shall be made by a reduction to the principal amount of the Note, such
reduction to be effective as of the Closing Date. If the Note is no longer
outstanding on the Determination Date, or has been assigned by the Seller as
permitted under the Note, any such negative Net Asset Adjustment shall
be made by a cash payment by the Seller to the Purchaser of the amount of the
Net Asset Adjustment, plus interest from the Closing Date at   2   the
Stated Rate. Any such reduction of the Note or payment shall be made
within five days of the Determination Date.   (b) Within 60 days after the
Closing Date, the Seller will provide the Purchaser with a reasonably
detailed calculation of the Net Asset Adjustment for the Purchaser\'s review
and approval (the "Calculation"). The Calculation shall  ----------- be
deemed to be final and conclusive and agreed to by the Purchaser and
the Seller, and shall be the basis for the Net Asset Adjustment provided for
in Section 1.4(a), unless the Purchaser gives written notice to the Seller,
within -------------- 90 days of the Purchaser\'s receipt of the
Calculation, that Purchaser disputes the Calculation. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall attempt, within 30 days after any such dispute notice is given,
to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute
within such 30 days, the Purchaser and the Seller shall resolve the dispute
in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section
1.4(c). --------------   (c) If the parties do not agree on the amount of
the Net Asset Adjustment within 30 days after a dispute notice is given (as
described in Section 1.4(b)),  -------------- they shall engage the Houston
office of Ernst and Young LLP for the limited purpose of resolving only the
disagreements of the parties with respect to the Calculation, provided that
all determinations made by such accounting firm shall be made in accordance
with this Section 1.4. The determinations of such  ----------- accounting
firm shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, and the fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be divided equally between the
Seller and the Purchaser. For purposes hereof, "Determination Date" shall
mean the date on  ------------------ which the final determination of the
Net Asset Adjustment is made in accordance with either Section 1.4(b) or
Section 1.4(c).  -------------- --------------   (d) For the purpose of
Section 1.4, the Company\'s "Closing Net Assets"  -----------
------------------ means the excess of the assets of the Company over the
liabilities of the Company as of 11:59 p.m. on October 7, 2000, determined in
accordance with GAAP, except as set forth on Exhibit C, and on a basis
consistent with the Company\'s  --------- preparation of the Balance Sheet
(as defined below); provided, however, that (i) the Company\'s assets shall
not include any cash or trading securities (other than petty cash and
checking accounts associated with branch offices of the Company); (ii) the
Company\'s liabilities shall not include any liabilities for "held checks";
(iii) the Company\'s inventory shall be valued based on the Standard Cost
Method, and the amount of such inventory shall be determined solely based on
the values and amounts reflected in the Books and Records (as defined below)
of the Company without any physical count of such inventory, provided that
the amount of such inventory as reflected in the Books and Records shall be
increased or decreased, as appropriate, if and only if, the aggregate amount
of all Clerical Inventory Errors (the "Inventory Adjustment") (which 
-------------------- Inventory Adjustment shall be calculated by taking into
account all Clerical Inventory Errors that either increase or decrease the
amount of such inventory) exceeds $100,000, and in such event, the Company\'s
inventory shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, by the full amount
of the Inventory Adjustment; (iv) the Company\'s capitalized overhead
variances which have not been allocated to specific parts shall not exceed
$1,000,000; (v) the Company\'s Accounts Receivable (as defined below) (other
than the Company\'s Accounts Receivable from Applied Materials, Inc. which
shall not be governed by this clause (v), but instead shall be governed by
clause (vi)) as reflected in the   3   Company\'s Books and Records shall
be reduced, if, and only if, the Company is required, in accordance with
GAAP, to establish an allowance for doubtful receivables in excess of
$1,000,000, and in such event, the Company\'s Accounts Receivable shall be
reduced only by the amount of such allowance for doubtful receivables in
excess of $1,000,000; (vi) the Company\'s Accounts Receivable from Applied
Materials, Inc. as of October 7, 2000 (the "Applied Materials 
----------------- Receivables") as reflected in the Company\'s Books and
Records shall be reduced ----------- by fifty percent of the amount of any
of the Applied Materials Receivables that the Company agrees to write off
before the Determination Date in settlement of the Company\'s dispute with
Applied Materials, Inc. as to the amount of the Applied Materials
Receivables; (vii) the loss of any leasehold improvements due to the
termination of the related lease as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not result in an adjustment to Closing Net Assets;
(viii) the Company\'s assets and liabilities shall not include any federal,
state, local or foreign Taxes attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election
(as defined below); (ix) the Transferred Real Property shall have a value of
$3,178,000 as reflected on the Balance Sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date;
(x) the value of all assets transferred by the Seller to the Company
as contemplated by this Agreement is reflected in the Balance Sheet as of
the Balance Sheet Date, except for the value of the deposits under certain
leases; (xi) the Company\'s Closing Net Assets shall not include any
capitalized leases; and (xii) the Company\'s Closing Net Assets shall not
include any intercompany accounts between the Seller and the Company. An
example of the calculation of Closing Net Assets as of August 26, 2000 is set
forth on Schedule 1.4(d) hereto.  ---------------   SECTION 1.5 Closing.

Certain Assignments. Except as provided in this Section 1.7, 
------------------- ----------- Section 6.10 or Section 6.11, the Seller
shall not have any obligation under ------------ ------------ this Agreement
with respect to any failure to obtain any third party consent, waiver or
approval that is required for transfer of any of the Assigned Contracts and
Leases or any other lease or contract and the Purchaser, the Company or its
Non-Corporate Subsidiaries shall be or remain liable with respect to, and
indemnify the Seller against any liability in respect of, any of
such Assigned Contracts and Leases or other lease or contract for which any
such third party consent, waiver or approval is not obtained. If (x) any
required consent, waiver or approval to the direct or indirect transfer or
assignment to the Purchaser, the Company or its Non-Corporate Subsidiaries of
any Assigned Contracts and Leases or other lease or contract is not obtained,
(y) an attempted transfer or assignment would be ineffective or would
adversely affect the rights of the Seller, the Purchaser, the Company or its
Non-Corporate Subsidiaries thereunder so that the Purchaser, the Company or
its Non-Corporate Subsidiaries would not receive substantially all of such
rights, or (z) any lease or contract is assigned to the Company or its Non-
Corporate Subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions hereof and the other
contracting party thereafter raises objections to the assignment and refuses
to allow the Company or its Non- Corporate Subsidiaries to perform the lease
or contract on the terms therein provided, or threatens to terminate the
lease or contract or sue for damages, the Purchaser, the Company or its Non-
Corporate Subsidiaries and the Seller, as appropriate, shall cooperate in any
arrangement the Purchaser may reasonably request to provide for the Purchaser
the benefits under such lease or contract. If any consent, waiver or approval
of any Person is required for any such transfer or assignment and is not
obtained, then at the request of the Purchaser the Seller shall take all
reasonable and appropriate steps ("Actions") to  ------- provide the
Purchaser, the Company or its Non-Corporate Subsidiaries the benefits under
any such lease or contract in accordance with the terms thereof (provided
such Actions are not prohibited by the terms of such lease or contract)
including, without limitation, (i) entering into subcontracts, sublicenses,
subleases, sale and leasebacks, use and service agreements or
other contractual arrangements which will provide such benefits to the
Purchaser\'s reasonable satisfaction, and (ii) enforcing, at the expense of
the Purchaser and for the benefit of the Purchaser, any and all rights  
6   of the Company, its Non-Corporate Subsidiaries or the Seller against
the other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by
such party or otherwise. If any request is made of the Seller pursuant to
this Section 1.7 or  ----------- the Seller is required to take any Action
as provided herein, then any material expense of complying with such request
or taking such Action shall be borne by the Purchaser, except to the extent
provided in Section 6.10 or Section 6.11.  ------------ ------------  
ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER   The Seller makes
the representations and warranties set forth in this  Article II to the
Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, ---------- Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.6, 2.8, 2.9(b),
2.9(g), 2.9(k), 2.9(p)(as 
---------------------------------------------------- such subsection relates
to Sections 2.9(b),(g) and (k)), 2.18, 2.20 and
2.21 -------------------------------------------------------------------
---- shall be deemed inaccurate or breached solely because certain of the
Company\'s assets shall be owned by the Non-Corporate Subsidiaries as a
result of the Asset Drop Down. In addition, references to the Company shall
be deemed to be references to an applicable Non-Corporate Subsidiary where
the context so requires. The Seller has delivered to the Purchaser the
Schedules to this Agreement referred to in this Article II on the date hereof
and such Schedules  ---------- have been reviewed and accepted by the
Purchaser. The Schedules shall be arranged to correspond to the Sections
contained in this Article II, and the  ---------- disclosures in any
Schedule shall qualify only (a) the corresponding Section of this Article II
and (b) other Sections of this Article II to the extent that  ----------
---------- either (i) a Schedule includes a specific cross reference to
another Schedule or (ii) it is clear (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other Sections.   SECTION 2.1 Organization
and Qualification. The Company is duly 
------------------------------ incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it has
been and is now being conducted, and to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets, and to perform all its obligations under the agreements and
instruments to which it is a party or by which it is bound. The Company is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it make such qualification necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be duly qualified or in good
standing, either alone or together with any other such failure, does not and
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Each such jurisdiction in which the Company is so qualified is
listed on Schedule 2.1.  ------------ Except for the Non-Corporate
Subsidiaries, the Company has no Subsidiaries. The Company is not a member of
(nor is any part of its business conducted through) any partnerships, nor is
it a participant in any joint venture or similar arrangement.   SECTION 2.2
Company Capitalization.  -----------------------   (a) The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 3,000 shares of Common Stock, of
which 1,000 shares of Common Stock are issued and outstanding, and no shares
of   7   Common Stock are held in treasury. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, phantom stock, convertible securities, rights,
warrants, calls, irrevocable proxies or other agreements or commitments of
any kind directly or indirectly obligating the Company to issue any security
of or equity interest in the Company, or irrevocable proxies or any
agreements restricting the transfer of or otherwise relating to any security
or equity interest in the Company. All of the Shares have been duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and are free
of preemptive rights and constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Company.   (b) The Seller (i) owns, beneficially and of record,
the Shares, free and clear of any and all liens, claims and encumbrances,
(ii) is in rightful possession of duly and validly authorized and issued
certificates evidencing its ownership of record of such Shares and (iii) has
full right, power and authority to sell, transfer, convey and deliver to the
Purchaser, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, indefeasible title

progress and substantive aspects of the treatment of any Seller\'s Items and
(ii) Seller shall not compromise or settle any of Seller\'s Items without
obtaining Purchaser\'s consent, which consent shall not be

Agreement, to the extent that the provisions contained in Section 6.4
conflict with the provisions  ----------- contained in this Section 5.6(d),
the provisions contained in this Section  ------------- ------- 5.6(d) shall
control. ------   (e) Allocation of Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement,
in the case of  ------------------- Taxes that are payable with respect to a

portion of such Taxes payable for the period ending on the Closing Date shall
be (a) in the case of any Tax based upon or measured by income, and in the
case of sale or use tax, the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended as of the end of the Closing Date and (b) in the case of any other
Tax, such as property taxes, the amount of such Tax for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the

of days in the entire period.   SECTION 5.6 Conveyance Taxes. Any transfer,
documentary, sales, use,  ---------------- stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

expense file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, if required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the Seller shall pay any of the foregoing taxes and fees incurred

or Assigned Contracts and Leases from the Seller to the Company or (ii) the
Asset Drop Down.   ARTICLE VI  REMEDIES   SECTION 6.1 Indemnification by

------------------------------------   29    SECTION 6.2 Indemnification
by Purchaser and the Company. Except as 
-------------------------------------------- otherwise expressly provided in
this Article VI and subject to the limitations  ---------- stated in this
Article VI, the Purchaser and the Company, jointly and severally,

operations, facts, circumstances, or acts of Purchaser or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates which shall occur subsequent to the Closing,
including any Taxes of the Company attributable to a Post-Closing Taxable
Period.   SECTION 6.3 Proceedings. With respect to matters not involving
any  ----------- judicial, administrative, arbitration, or investigatory
proceeding or other proceeding, claim or controversy (collectively, a
"Proceeding") brought or  ---------- asserted by third parties (and which
are not Highway Master and Environmental Matters which shall be governed by
Section 6.5), within ten days after  ----------- notification from a party
claiming a right to be indemnified (an "Indemnified  ----------- Party")
supported by reasonable documentation setting forth the nature of
the ----- circumstances entitling the Indemnified Party to indemnity
hereunder, the party against whom a claim for indemnity is being made (an
"Indemnifying Party"), at  ------------------ no cost or expense to the
Indemnified Party, shall diligently commence resolution of such matters in a
manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall diligently
and timely prosecute such resolution to completion. If the Indemnifying
Party, within ten days after notice, fails to diligently commence resolution
of such matters in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the resolution of
such matters at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party. With respect to
those claims that may be satisfied by payment of a liquidated sum of money,
including, without limitation, claims for reimbursement of expenses incurred
in connection with any circumstances entitling the Indemnified Party
to indemnity hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the full amount so
claimed to the extent supported by reasonable documentation within 15 days of
such resolution. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability in
connection with such claim, it shall pay any undisputed part of such
liability, and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt
for 30 days to resolve any remaining dispute.   SECTION 6.4 Notice and
Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any Proceeding 
---------------------------------------- shall be brought or asserted by a
third party against an Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity  
30   may be sought under this Article from an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice of such Proceeding to the
Indemnifying Party who shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the payment of all reasonable expenses; provided, that any delay or failure
so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure. In no event shall any Indemnified Party be
required to make any expenditure or bring any cause of action to enforce the
Indemnifying Party\'s obligations and liability under and pursuant to the
indemnifications set forth in this Article. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing Proceedings and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless the
Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that there exist actual or
potential conflicts of interest which make representation by the same counsel
inappropriate, in which case the cost of such additional counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party\'s right to
participate in the defense or response to any Proceeding should not be deemed
to limit or otherwise modify its obligations under this Article. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party, within 10 business days after notice of any such
Proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Proceeding for the account of and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise any
Proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any Proceeding unless (i) the terms of such compromise or settlement require
no more than the payment of money (i.e., such compromise or settlement does
not require the Indemnified Party to admit any wrongdoing or take or refrain
from taking any action), (ii) the full amount of such monetary compromise or
settlement will be paid by the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) the Indemnified
Party receives as part of such settlement a legal, binding and enforceable
unconditional satisfaction and/or release, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to it, provided that such third-party claim and any claimed
liability of the Indemnified Party with respect thereto is being fully
satisfied by reason of such compromise. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.4, this Section 6.4  -----------
----------- shall not apply to any Proceeding brought or asserted by a third
party for which the Purchaser or the Company shall be entitled to
indemnification under Section  ------- 6.1(c) or Section 6.1(d) which shall
be governed solely by Section 6.5. ------ -------------- -----------  
SECTION 6.5 Litigation and Environmental Matters. Notwithstanding any 
------------------------------------ other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, this Section 6.5 shall govern  ----------- the resolution of the
Litigation and Environmental Matters. Seller agrees to timely pursue the
resolution of the Litigation and Environmental Matters for which further
resolution is necessary, subject to, in the case of the Highway Master
Matter, the limit set forth in Section 6.6(b)(ii). Purchaser shall 
----------------- provide Seller with prompt written notice of any Proceeding
which constitutes a Litigation and Environmental Matter and any delay or
failure to so notify Seller shall relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder
with respect to such Proceeding to the extent that Seller is prejudiced by
such delay or failure to so notify. Seller shall retain exclusive control
over the manner and means by which to prosecute or defend or otherwise
resolve any Litigation and Environmental   31   Matters; provided Seller
shall provide Purchaser with a copy of any document relating to the pursuit
of resolution of a Litigation and Environmental Matter. At the Seller\'s
expense, the Purchaser and the Company will cooperate with the Seller, and
will use reasonable efforts to cause the employees of the Company
to cooperate with the Seller, in furnishing information, evidence, testimony,
and other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Seller in
connection with any Proceeding or other efforts by the Seller to resolve the
Litigation and Environmental Matters.   If Purchaser contends that Seller
is not timely pursuing resolution of a Litigation and Environmental Matter,
Purchaser shall deliver written notice to Seller of such belief, and if
within 30 days after receipt of such notice by Seller, Seller does not
commence or resume resolution of such Litigation and Environmental Matter,
Purchaser may undertake resolution of the same for the account of and at the
expense of Seller. Resolution of the Covered Environmental Matter described
in Section 6.1(d)(1) shall be evidenced by  ----------------- receipt from
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission or other applicable
Governmental Authority of written evidence that Seller has remediated the
Compressor/Vacuum Storage Area referenced in Item 1 of Schedule 2.17 to 
------------- standards no less stringent than Remedy Standard A applicable
to commercial property under 30 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 350.
Resolution of the Covered Environmental Matter described in Section 6.1(d)(2)
shall be evidenced  ----------------- by receipt from the TNRCC or other
applicable Governmental Authority of written confirmation to the effect that
no further action is necessary in connection with environmental media
affected by conditions referenced in Item 2 of Schedule  -------- 2.17,
assuming the commercial use of the subject property.
Purchaser ---- acknowledges that remediation to standards applicable to
commercial property may require the filing of documents in the real property
records restricting the use of the property at 1111 Gillingham Lane, Houston,
Texas to non-residential purposes, and Purchaser agrees to the filing of such
documents.   SECTION 6.6 Limitations of Liability. 
------------------------   (a) An Indemnifying Party shall have no liability
for any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made under this
Agreement unless written notice of a claim for indemnity, or written notice
of specific facts as to which an indemnifiable Loss is expected to be
incurred, shall have been given prior to March 31, 2002; provided, however,
that (i) the sole remedy for any breach or inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 2.6  ----------- (Financial Statements)
(insofar as Section 2.6 relates to Accounts Receivable  ----------- and
Inventory), Section 2.7 (Accounts Receivable) or Section 2.8 (Inventory) 
----------- ----------- shall be the determination of the Net Asset
Adjustment under Section 1.4; (ii)  ----------- with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2.17 
------------ (Environmental Compliance), written notice of a claim for
indemnity, or written notice of facts as to which an indemnifiable Loss is
expected to be incurred, shall have been given within four years after the
Closing Date; (iii) with respect to the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.12 (Tax  ------------ Matters) and Section 2.13
(Employee Benefit Plans), written notice of a claim  ------------ for
indemnity, or written notice of facts as to which an indemnifiable Loss
is expected to be incurred, shall have been given within 30 days after
the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions)
applicable to such matter; and (iv) with respect to the representations and
warranties contained in Section 2.1  -----------   32   (Organization
and Qualification), Section 2.2 (Company Capitalization), Section 
----------- ------- 2.3 (Authority Relative to Agreement), Section 3.1
(Organization and --- ----------- Qualification), and Section 3.3 (Authority
Relative to Agreement) or acts of  ----------- fraud or willful
misrepresentation by the party making any representation or warranty, written
notice of a claim for indemnity, or written notice of facts as to which an
indemnifiable loss is expected to be incurred, may be given at any time. The
right to indemnification, payment of damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will not be
affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) before the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The written waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of
or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.   (b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
aggregate liability of the Seller for all events or occurrences giving
rise to the Seller being required to indemnify the Purchaser or the Company
(i) under Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.1(b) shall not exceed $30,000,000 and
(ii) under -------------- -------------- Section 6.1(c) shall not exceed
$450,000. --------------   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the last sentence of this Section
6.6(c), the Seller shall be  -------------- liable for indemnification under
this Article VI only to the extent that the  ---------- amount of any
indemnifiable Loss, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
Losses covered by this Agreement, exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket"); 
------ provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for indemnification
under this Article VI unless and until the amount of the Loss with respect to
any  ---------- individual claim exceeds $10,000 (the "Threshold"); and
provided, further,  --------- however, that solely for purposes of
determining when indemnifiable Losses exceed the Basket or if a particular
Loss exceeds the Threshold, all representations and warranties of the Seller
set forth in Article II shall be  ---------- deemed to have been made
without any qualifications relating to Knowledge or materiality (it being
understood and agreed that all such qualifications relating to Knowledge and
materiality shall apply after the aggregate of all indemnifiable Losses
exceeds the Basket). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Basket shall
not apply to (i) claims for indemnification under (A) the representation and
warranties contained in Section 2.12 (Tax Matters) or  ------------ Section
2.13 (Employee Benefit Plans), (B) Section 6.1(c), (C) Section
6.1(d), ------------ -------------- -------------- (D) Section 6.10 or (E)
Section 6.11, or (ii) the determination of the Net Asset  ------------
------------ Adjustment under Section 1.4, and indemnifiable Losses arising
from claims  ----------- described in clause (i) of this sentence shall not
be applied toward the satisfaction of the Basket.   (d) In calculating the
amount of any Loss for which any Indemnifying Party is liable under this
Article, there shall be taken into consideration (i) the value of any federal
or state income tax benefits theretofore actually received by the Indemnified
Party and (ii) the amount of any insurance recoveries, excluding any amounts
which are in effect self-insured whether through retention amounts or
otherwise, to which the Indemnified Party is entitled, in each case as a
direct consequence of the circumstances to which the Loss related or
from which the Loss resulted or arose.   33    (e) The Purchaser and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss
suffered, incurred or sustained by the Purchaser or the Company arising out
of any matter for which the Purchaser and the Company are entitled to
indemnification herein, upon the Purchaser or the Company having obtained
actual knowledge of such breach by the Seller. In the event that
the Purchaser and the Company shall fail to make such commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss, then notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary contained herein, the Seller shall not be required to
indemnify the Purchaser or the Company for any Loss that could reasonably be
expected to have been avoided had the Purchaser and the Company made such
efforts. The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this Section
6.6(e) shall not  -------------- impose any duty on the Company to conduct
its business and operations outside the ordinary course of business.   (f)
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, NO PARTY HERETO SHALL
HAVE ANY LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (SUCH
AS LOSS OF PROFIT), OR TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE
UNDER TEXAS LAW, THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE, OR FEDERAL LAW; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6.6(f) SHALL NOT
APPLY TO (i) SUCH DAMAGES  ------------- SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL AWARD IN A
THIRD-PARTY CLAIM GIVING RISE TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE VI OR
(ii) SUCH DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ACTS OF FRAUD OR  ---------- WILLFUL
MISREPRESENTATION BY THE PARTY MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.   SECTION 6.7 Exclusive Remedies.  ------------------

Statements) (insofar as Section 2.6 relates to  -----------
------------ Accounts Receivable and Inventory), Section 2.7 (Accounts
Receivable) or Section  ----------- ------- 2.8 (Inventory), the sole remedy
for which shall be the determination of the Net --- Asset Adjustment under

----------- agreements or obligations contained in this Agreement, any
Transaction Document or in any other agreement or document executed and
delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) any Loss, relating to, resulting from or

Adjustment Note by the Purchaser or the Company as provided under the term of
the Note, the Adjustment Note or any document or instrument governing the
rights of the Seller under the Note or the Adjustment Note.   SECTION 6.8
Treatment of Indemnity Provisions. All indemnity payments made 
--------------------------------- under Article VI of this Agreement shall be
considered an adjustment to the  ---------- Purchase Price.   SECTION 6.9
Payment of Indemnification Obligation. The parties hereto 
------------------------------------- agree that (i) if the Purchase Price is
reduced pursuant to Section 1.4, or (ii)  ----------- if the Seller becomes

indemnification by instructing the ----------- Purchaser and the Company in
writing as follows: (a) first, to reduce the accrued but unpaid interest on
