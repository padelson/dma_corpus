 \t\t

 \t\t\tTHIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of
October 29, 2017, by and among Capella Education Company, a Minnesota
corporation ("Cardinal"), Strayer Education, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("Sarg"), and Sarg Sub Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Sarg ("Merger Sub"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tRECITALS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, each of Cardinal, Sarg and Merger Sub desire, following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, to effect the
Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement pursuant to
which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Cardinal, with Cardinal as the
surviving entity in the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of
Sarg; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Cardinal, Sarg and Merger
Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the plan of merger
(as such term is used in Section 302A.611 of the MBCA) contained in this
Agreement (the "Plan of Merger") and the Transactions, including the Merger,
and determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective companies and shareholders to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Sarg has, subject to Section 5.4,
resolved to recommend the approval of the Sarg Share Issuance and the
amendment and restatement of the Sarg Charter as set forth in the Amended Sarg
Charter to the Sarg stockholders, and, following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Sarg shall approve this Agreement and the Merger as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Cardinal has, subject to Section
5.4, resolved to recommend the approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the
adoption of the Plan of Merger by the Cardinal shareholders; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, Cardinal, Sarg and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the parties
hereto intend that the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and that this Agreement shall be, and
hereby is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354,
361 and 368 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAGREEMENT \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 1 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTHE MERGER \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.1 The Merger. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Cardinal (the "Merger") in accordance with the MBCA, and upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and Cardinal shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarg. The
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to
herein as the "Transactions." References herein to "Cardinal" with respect to
the period from and after the Effective Time shall be deemed to be references
to the Surviving Corporation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
applicable provisions of the MBCA. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and duties of
Cardinal and Merger Sub, all as provided under the MBCA. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York,
New York 10022-4834, at 9:00 a.m. local time, as soon as practicable (and, in
any event, within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all applicable conditions set forth in
Article 6 (except for any conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions
or waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions) or at such other
time and place as Cardinal and Sarg shall agree; provided that if such date
would make it reasonably unlikely for the parties to either (a) comply with
any Educational Laws applicable on a post-Closing basis in order to obtain any
Educational Consent or (b) satisfy conditions under applicable DOE regulations
for continuing the effectiveness of any TPPPA, the Closing will take place on
the first (1st) Business Day of the immediately following month, without
regard to the Outside Date (unless Cardinal and Merger Sub mutually agree to
an earlier date in writing). The date and time at which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.3 Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On the Closing Date, Cardinal and Merger Sub shall file
articles of merger relating to the Merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of Minnesota, executed and acknowledged in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the MBCA. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles
of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Minnesota, or such later time as Sarg and Cardinal shall agree and specify
in the Articles of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.4 Charters and Bylaws. \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t2  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated pursuant to the Merger in their
entirety as set forth on Exhibit A, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law. The name of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time shall be "Capella Education Company". At
the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated in their entirety so as to be identical to the bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name
of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be
"Capella Education Company") until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Sarg Charter and Bylaws; Name. Subject to the receipt of
the Sarg Stockholder Approval, at the Effective Time, the Sarg Charter (as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be amended and restated
in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit B (the "Amended Sarg Charter"), until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
Sarg Board will take such action as is necessary in order that, as set forth
in the Amended Sarg Charter, the name of Sarg from and after the Effective
Time shall be "Strategic Education, Inc.". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be designated by Sarg and (ii)
the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be designated by Sarg. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.6 Directors and Officers of Sarg. Effective at the Effective
Time, unless otherwise agreed by Sarg and Cardinal in writing, the Sarg Board
shall take all necessary action to cause the size of the Sarg Board to be
increased to twelve (12) directors in order to appoint, as of the Effective
Time, nine (9) directors to be designated, prior to the consummation of the
Merger, by Sarg and three (3) directors to be designated, prior to the
consummation of the Merger, by Cardinal pursuant to the procedure set forth in
the following sentence (such designees of Cardinal, the "Additional Board
Designees"). The Additional Board Designees shall consist of (i) the chief
executive officer of Cardinal as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) two
(2) additional designees (or, if clause (i) is not applicable, three (3)
designees) who are currently members of the Cardinal Board recommended by the
chief executive officer of Cardinal or the Cardinal Board (if clause (i) is
not applicable) to the Sarg Board and the nominating and corporate governance
committee of the Sarg Board for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld. Prior to the 2019 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, Sarg and the
Sarg Board shall not take any actions to increase the size of the Sarg Board
to more than twelve (12) directors without the consent of a majority of the
Additional Board Designees. Effective at the Effective Time, unless otherwise
agreed by Sarg and Cardinal in writing, Sarg shall take all necessary action
to cause (i) Robert S. Silberman to continue as executive chairman of the Sarg
Board, (ii) J. Kevin Gilligan to be appointed to act as the vice chairman of
the Sarg Board, (iii) Karl McDonnell to continue as the President and Chief
Executive Officer of Sarg, (iv) Steven L. Polacek to be appointed as the Chief
Integration/Transition Officer of Sarg and (v) one Additional Board Designee
to be appointed to the compensation committee of the Sarg Board. The Sarg
Board shall nominate the Additional Board Designees for election at (i) if the
Effective Time is prior to the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then
the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders or (ii) if the Effective
Time \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t3  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tis after the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then the 2019
annual meeting of Sarg stockholders. In the event that any of the Additional
Board Designees becomes unable to serve as a member of the Sarg Board and
resigns therefrom due to such person's death or disability prior to the 2019
annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then a replacement to fill the resulting
vacancy on the Sarg Board shall be recommended by the remaining Additional
Board Designees to the Sarg Board and the nominating and corporate governance
committee of the Sarg Board for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 2 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tCONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.1 Effect on Capital Stock of Cardinal and Merger Sub. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Cardinal, Sarg, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of Cardinal common
stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Cardinal Common Stock"): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) All shares of Cardinal Common Stock that are owned by
Cardinal, Sarg, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Cardinal, Sarg
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and
Section 2.6, each share of Cardinal Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter
represent the right to receive that number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Sarg common stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Sarg
Common Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Sarg Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.4. The shares of
Sarg Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Cardinal
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1, and the cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Sarg Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.4, are
referred to collectively as the "Merger Consideration." For purposes of this
Agreement, "Exchange Ratio" means 0.875. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) All of the outstanding shares of Cardinal Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Section 2.1 and shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist
and, as of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing any
such shares of Cardinal Common Stock (a "Cardinal Certificate") or shares of
Cardinal Common Stock held in book entry form ("Cardinal Book-Entry Shares")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, in accordance with Section 2.1(b), the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, upon surrender of such
Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Surviving Corporation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t4  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 Effect on Sarg Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each
share of Sarg Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding. Immediately following the Effective
Time, shares of Sarg Common Stock owned by Surviving Corporation or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Surviving Corporation shall be surrendered to Sarg and
cancelled without payment therefor. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Cardinal Common Stock or Sarg Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide
the holders of Cardinal Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Sarg Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of
Cardinal Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Sarg Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
such fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder of Sarg. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Cardinal Common
Stock that are converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fractional share of Sarg Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Cardinal Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock. The parties
acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares is
solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Sarg of
issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.5 Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to
the shareholders of Cardinal and the stockholders of Sarg, Sarg shall appoint
its transfer agent to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Sarg shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited, in trust
for the benefit of the holders of Cardinal Common Stock, with the Exchange
Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, (i) a number of shares
of Sarg Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of Sarg Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments (x)
of any dividends or other distributions declared or made prior to the
Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time to such holders and
(y) in lieu of any fractional shares of Sarg Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.4 (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of Sarg Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by Section 2.4 hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter),
Sarg shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share, in each case which shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Cardinal Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Cardinal
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and
have such other provisions as Cardinal, Sarg and the Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, as applicable. With respect to holders of Cardinal Book-Entry
Shares, the parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange
Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to transmit, following the Effective Time,
to such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Cardinal Common Stock,
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon
surrender of Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Sarg and Cardinal, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form with all required enclosures and attachments,
with respect to such Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Cardinal Common
Stock formerly represented by such Cardinal Certificates and for each Cardinal
Book‑Entry Share. Any Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Cardinal Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent to payment that the Cardinal Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration, as
applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of the Cardinal
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
Sarg that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Delivery of the Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to Cardinal
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Cardinal
Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby,
each Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Cardinal shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Cardinal Common Stock on the records of
Cardinal. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Cardinal
Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Cardinal
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Cardinal
Certificates representing shares of Cardinal Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Sarg shall be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t6  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tdeliver to it any shares of Sarg Common Stock or cash remaining in the
Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and not delivered to
holders of Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Sarg (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in Section 2.5. If, prior to six years after the Closing Date (or
otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.5 to receive the Merger Consideration to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the Merger Consideration to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled in respect of such Cardinal
Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Sarg, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Sarg nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that
any Cardinal Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Cardinal Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) hereof; provided, however, that Sarg or the Exchange Agent
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of the Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Cardinal Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Sarg, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Cardinal Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Cardinal Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Sarg Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Cardinal
Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Sarg
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.4, unless and
until the holder of such Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share
shall surrender such Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or
other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Cardinal Certificate,
there shall be paid by Sarg to the holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of Sarg Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a
fractional share of Sarg Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.4 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Sarg Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Sarg Common
Stock. \t\t

 \t\t\t2.6 Cardinal Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Treatment of Cardinal Stock Options. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares
of Cardinal Common Stock (a "Cardinal Stock Option") granted under (i) the
Cardinal 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Cardinal 2005 Stock Plan") or (ii)
the Cardinal 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Cardinal 2014 Equity Plan" and
together with the Cardinal 2005 Stock Plan, the "Cardinal Stock Plans") to a
Cardinal non-employee director who will not be a member of the Board of
Directors of Sarg immediately following the Effective Time (a "Cardinal
Director Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration that would have been payable in respect of
each Net Company Share in respect of such Cardinal Director Stock Options had
such Net Company Share been outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that (A) any holder who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Sarg Common Stock in respect of a
Cardinal Director Stock Option shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Sarg Common
Stock multiplied by the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock and (B) any Cardinal
Director Stock Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration Value shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
for no consideration. Any delivery of shares of Sarg Common Stock or cash in
lieu thereof pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)(i) shall be subject to the same
procedures, requirements and conditions as applicable to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Cardinal Stock
Option granted under the Cardinal Stock Plans to a former Cardinal employee,
director or consultant (a "Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of Net Company Shares in
respect of the applicable Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option had such Net
Company Shares been outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock; provided, however, that any Cardinal Non-
Employee Stock Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration Value shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
for no consideration. Any delivery of cash pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)(i)
shall be subject to the same procedures, requirements and conditions as
applicable to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\t(each, a "Cardinal Employee Stock Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Sarg and shall be converted into an
option (a "Sarg Stock Option") to acquire shares of Sarg Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 2.6(a)(iii). Each such Sarg Stock Option as so
assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the Cardinal Employee Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes
thereto by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective
Time, each such Sarg Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall be an
option to acquire that number of whole shares of Sarg Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Cardinal Common Stock subject to such Cardinal Employee Stock Option
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Sarg Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Cardinal Common Stock of such
Cardinal Employee Stock Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio; provided, that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Sarg Common Stock subject to the
Sarg Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Cardinal
Employee Stock Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Treatment of Cardinal Restricted Stock Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, each restricted stock unit
(including "market stock unit" and "performance stock unit") award granted
under the applicable Cardinal Stock Plan covering Cardinal Common Stock,
including any such awards subject to vesting based on the achievement of any
performance goals or market-based conditions, (each, a "Cardinal RSU") to a
Cardinal non-employee director (a "Cardinal Director RSU") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested in full. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Subject to Section 2.6(b)(iii) below, as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each Cardinal RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Sarg and shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit award (a "Sarg RSU") to acquire Sarg Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 2.6. Each such Sarg RSU as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Cardinal RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but taking into account any changes thereto by reason of this Agreement
or the Transactions), including, without limitation, to the extent applicable,
the requirement to deliver shares of Sarg Common Stock in respect thereof to
the extent that the holder of such Sarg RSU made a valid deferral election to
defer settlement of such Sarg RSU upon the occurrence of a "change in control
event" or a "separation from service", as \t\t

of Sarg Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Cardinal Common Stock underlying such
Cardinal RSU multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall take all
necessary action for the adjustment of Cardinal Employee Stock Options and
Cardinal RSUs under this Section 2.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) At the Effective Time, Sarg shall assume all the
obligations of Cardinal under the Cardinal Stock Plans, each Sarg Stock Option
and Sarg RSU that is assumed and converted in accordance with this Section
2.6, and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and the number and kind
of shares available for issuance under each Cardinal Stock Plan shall be
adjusted to reflect shares of Sarg Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Cardinal Stock Plan. Sarg shall reserve for
future issuance a number of shares of Sarg Common Stock at least equal to the
number of shares of Sarg Common Stock that will be subject to Sarg Stock
Options and Sarg RSUs as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section
2.6. Not later than the Closing Date, Sarg shall file an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the Sarg Common Stock subject to such Sarg Stock Options and Sarg RSUs and
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, distribute a prospectus
relating to such Form S-8, and Sarg shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Sarg Stock Options and Sarg RSUs remain
outstanding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Cardinal shall take all actions with respect to the Cardinal ESPP
that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger,
the Cardinal ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t\t2.7 Withholding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, including any payments made pursuant to
Section 2.6 hereof, any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. The parties or the Exchange
Agent, as appropriate, shall provide commercially reasonable notice to
Cardinal upon becoming aware of any such withholding obligation and shall
cooperate with Cardinal to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or
relief from such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Cardinal Common Stock, Cardinal Stock Option and/or Cardinal RSU in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. \t\t

 \t\t\tExcept (a) as set forth in the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and (b) as
otherwise disclosed or identified in the Sarg SEC Documents publicly filed or
furnished after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (other than (i)
any forward-looking disclosures contained in the "Forward Looking Statements"
and "Risk Factors" sections of the Sarg SEC Documents and any other
disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive,
cautionary or forward looking in nature and (ii) information included in, or
incorporated by reference as, exhibits and schedules to any Sarg SEC
Document), Sarg and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to Cardinal as
follows: \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1 Corporate Organization. Sarg is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Maryland and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Each of Sarg's Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub,
is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Sarg Material Adverse Effect. Each of Sarg and its Subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub, is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sarg Material Adverse Effect. The
copies of the charter of Sarg (the "Sarg Charter"), and Amended and Restated
Bylaws of Sarg (the "Sarg Bylaws"), as most recently filed with the Sarg SEC
Documents, and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub
previously provided to Cardinal, are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Sarg is not in
material violation of any of the provisions of the Sarg Charter or Sarg
Bylaws. \t\t

 \t\t\t3.2 Sarg Capitalization. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The authorized capital stock of Sarg consists of twenty
million (20,000,000) shares of Sarg Common Stock and eight million (8,000,000)

to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock of, or other Equity
Interests in, Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the close of business on

shares of capital stock reserved for issuance described in the second sentence

"incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All
shares of Sarg Common Stock subject to issuance under the Sarg Stock Plans,
upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Sarg
having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of Sarg may

registration for sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive right
with respect to, any shares of Sarg Common Stock or any capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

true and complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of Sarg, and the authorized,

preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by Sarg or one or
more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens. There are
no outstanding contractual obligations of Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries to

 \t\t\t(a) Each of Sarg and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform and

applicable to such party. The execution and delivery by each of Sarg and
Merger Sub of this Agreement, the performance and compliance by Sarg and

Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Cardinal of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws

Issuance and the amendment and restatement of the Sarg Charter as set forth in
the Amended Sarg Charter be submitted to the stockholders of Sarg for
approval, and (iv) recommending that Sarg stockholders approve the Sarg Share

in Section 4.21, to the Knowledge of Sarg, no takeover, anti-takeover,
business combination, control share acquisition or similar Law (collectively,
"Takeover Laws") applies to the Merger or the other Transactions. The only
vote of holders of any class or series of Sarg Common Stock or other Equity
Interests of Sarg necessary to consummate the Transactions is (i) the approval
of the Sarg Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast thereon at the Sarg Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) the approval of the
amendment and restatement of the Sarg Charter as set forth in the Amended Sarg
Charter by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
thereon by the holders of Sarg Common Stock at the Sarg Stockholders Meeting

assuming the Sarg Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate
any provision of the Sarg Charter or the Sarg Bylaws or any equivalent
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Sarg, including Merger Sub,

its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, pursuant to, any Contract or Permit,

connection with any Taxes and (vi) where failure to obtain such consents,

the SEC. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended, as of
the date of the last amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, each Sarg
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Sarg SEC
Document and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The consolidated financial statements of Sarg included in
the Sarg SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) and all related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by
Sarg's accountants with respect thereto (the "Sarg SEC Financial Statements"),
as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The Sarg SEC Financial
Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition
and the results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity
of Sarg (on a consolidated basis) as of the respective dates of and for the
periods referred to in the Sarg SEC Financial Statements, and were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), subject, in the case of
interim Sarg SEC Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (which
are not material in significance or amount) and the absence of notes. The
books and records of Sarg and its Subsidiaries are accurate and complete, in
all material respects, have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices and accurately present and reflect in all material respects all of
the transactions and actions therein described and the Sarg SEC Financial
Statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
such books and records. No financial statements of any Person other than Sarg
and its Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of Sarg. Except as required by GAAP, Sarg has not,
between June 30, 2017 and the date of this Agreement, made or adopted any
material change in its accounting methods, practices or policies in effect on
June 30, 2017. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Sarg is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Sarg has made available to Cardinal true and complete
copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since
January 1, 2015 relating to the Sarg SEC Documents and all written responses
of Sarg thereto other than with respect to requests for confidential treatment
or which are otherwise publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR system. To the
Knowledge of Sarg, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any Sarg SEC Documents and
none of the Sarg SEC \t\t

of ongoing SEC review. There are no internal investigations, any SEC
inquiries or investigations or other governmental inquiries or investigations,
to the Knowledge of Sarg, pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of Sarg. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Sarg has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Sarg's disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Sarg in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to Sarg's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Sarg's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Sarg's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Sarg SEC Document that
is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on Sarg's management's most recently completed evaluation
of Sarg's internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof,
(i) Sarg had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Sarg's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) Sarg does not have
Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Sarg's internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2015, none of Sarg, Sarg's auditors,

a complete and accurate list of all (i) issued patents and pending patent
applications, (ii) trademark and service mark registrations and applications,
(iii) copyright registrations and applications, and (iv) material internet
domain name registrations, in each case that are owned by Sarg or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Sarg Registered Intellectual Property").
With respect to each item required to be listed in Section 3.17(a) of the Sarg
Disclosure Schedule, (A) either Sarg or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole
owner and possesses all right, title and interest in and to the item, free and
clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and (B) to the Knowledge of
Sarg, no Proceeding is pending or threatened that challenges the legality,
validity, enforceability, registration, use or ownership of the item (except

Registered Intellectual \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tProperty that is shown as registered, filed, issued, or applied for in

abandoned or cancelled, (y) has been maintained effective by all requisite
filings, renewals and payments and (z) remains in full force and effect, and
each item of Sarg Registered Intellectual Property that is shown as registered
or issued is, to the Knowledge of Sarg, valid and enforceable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sarg Material Adverse Effect,
each of Sarg and its Subsidiaries owns and possesses all right, title and
interest in and to (or has the right pursuant to a valid and enforceable
license) all Intellectual Property that is necessary for or used or held for
use in the conduct of the business of Sarg and its Subsidiaries in
substantially the same manner as presently conducted and currently proposed to
be conducted. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sarg,
nor the performance of this Agreement by Sarg, will result in the loss,
forfeiture, termination, or impairment of, or give rise to a right of any
Person to limit, terminate, or consent to the continued use of, any rights of
Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries in any Sarg Material Intellectual Property. No
Sarg Material Intellectual Property owned by Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any outstanding consent, settlement, or Order prohibiting or
restricting Sarg's or any of its Subsidiaries' use, ownership, disposition or
other exploitation thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sarg Material Adverse Effect,
neither Sarg nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their businesses
is, or was during the past three (3) years, infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person. Neither Sarg nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge,
complaint, claim, demand, or notice in writing since January 1, 2013 (or
earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement,
misappropriation, dilution, or violation (including any claim that Sarg or any
of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property rights of any Person), in each case that would be material and
adverse to Sarg and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of
Sarg, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating any Intellectual Property owned by Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Sarg nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or asserted any charge,
complaint, claim, demand or notice since January 1, 2013 (or earlier, if
presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or violation with respect to any Sarg Material Intellectual
Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Sarg and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable steps to maintain, police and protect the Intellectual Property
that is material to their business ("Sarg Material Intellectual Property").
All Sarg Material Intellectual Property that derives independent economic
value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to
other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use has
been maintained in confidence in accordance with protection procedures that
are adequate for protection, and in accordance with procedures customarily
used in the industry to protect rights of like importance. To the Knowledge
of Sarg, there has been no unauthorized use or disclosure of any confidential
Sarg Material Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Sarg, all former and
current officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors, and independent
contractors of Sarg and its Subsidiaries, and each of their predecessors, who
have contributed to or participated in the \t\t

 \t\t\tconception and development of Sarg Material Intellectual Property for
such entities have entered into valid and binding proprietary rights
agreements with Sarg or one of its Subsidiaries or predecessors, vesting
ownership of such Sarg Material Intellectual Property in Sarg or one of its
Subsidiaries, without any restrictions or obligations on Sarg or its
Subsidiaries' use, ownership, disposition or other exploitation of such Sarg
Material Intellectual Property. No such Person has asserted, and to the
Knowledge of Sarg, no such Person has, any right, title, interest or other
claim in, or the right to receive any royalties or other consideration with
respect to, any such Sarg Material Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The IT Assets of Sarg and its Subsidiaries (i) are
sufficient for the needs of their businesses in all material respects
(including with respect to the number of license seats) and (ii) operate in
all material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional
specifications and as required by Sarg and its Subsidiaries and have not, in
the last three (3) years, materially malfunctioned or failed such that it
resulted in a disruption to the conduct of the business. Sarg and its
Subsidiaries have implemented commercially reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality and security of such IT Assets and information stored or
contained therein against any unauthorized use, access, interruption or
corruption. Sarg and its Subsidiaries have implemented commercially
reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster avoidance
procedures with respect to their IT Assets. To the Knowledge of Sarg, there
have not been any incidents of security breaches to, or other material
unauthorized access to or use of, (i) any of its IT Assets (including with
respect to any data or other information stored or contained therein or
accessed, transmitted or processed thereby), or (ii) any data, trade secrets
or other confidential information of Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any business information and/or personally-identifying information
or data of any Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) No software included in the Sarg Material Intellectual
Property, which is distributed to any third party by or on behalf of Sarg or
its Subsidiaries (other than software identified as belonging to a third party
and subject to a third party paid or public license), or for which Sarg or its
Subsidiaries have current plans to distribute to any third party, incorporates
or is comprised of or distributed with any publicly available software, or is
otherwise subject to the provisions of any "open source" or third party
license agreement that (i) requires the distribution of source code in
connection with the distribution of such software in object code form; (ii)
materially limits Sarg's or any of its Subsidiaries' freedom to seek full
compensation in connection with marketing, licensing, and distributing such
applications; or (iii) allows a customer or requires that a customer have the
right to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the software by
its terms and not by operation of law. With respect to each item of software
included in the Sarg Material Intellectual Property, either Sarg or one of its
Subsidiaries is (or will be at Closing) in actual possession and control of
the applicable source code, object code, code writes, notes, documentation,
programmers' source code annotations, user manuals and know-how to the extent
required for use, distribution, development, enhancement, maintenance and
support of such software, subject to any licenses granted to third parties
therein. \t\t

Educational Agency to not approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either prior to the Closing or following the Closing) or (B)
impose conditions on such approval that would, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the ability of the Surviving Corporation to
operate the Sarg Schools in substantially the manner in which they are
currently operated. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Neither Sarg nor any Title IV Sarg School has contracted
with an institution or third-party servicer that has been terminated under
Section 432 or 487 of the HEA for a reason involving the acquisition, use or
expenditure of funds of a Governmental Entity or Educational Agency, or has
been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any
other violation of Law involving funds of any Governmental Entity or
Educational Agency. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Neither Sarg nor any Title IV Sarg School has contracted
with or employed any Person that has been, or whose officers or employees have
been, convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving
the acquisition, use or expenditure of funds of any Governmental Entity or
Educational Agency, or administratively or judicially determined to have
committed fraud or any other violation of Law involving funds of any
Governmental Entity or Educational Agency. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Neither Sarg nor any Title IV Sarg School nor any
principal (as such term is defined in 2 C.F.R. Parts 180 and 3485) or
affiliate (as such term is defined in 2 C.F.R. Part 180) of any of the
foregoing, is or has been debarred or suspended under 2 C.F.R. Part 180, 2
C.F.R. 3485, 48 C.F.R. Part 9, or 48 C.F.R. Part 3409, nor does cause exist
for such debarment or suspension. \t\t

finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fee, broker's
fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t\t3.20 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Perella Weinberg Partners LP,
Sarg's financial advisor, has delivered to the Sarg Board its opinion in
writing or orally, in which case, such opinion will be subsequently confirmed
in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and
subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Sarg. A true and
complete copy of the signed, written opinion of the Perella Weinberg Partners
LP will promptly be made available to Cardinal following its delivery to Sarg
for informational purposes only. \t\t

affiliate or associate of either of the foregoing, been, an "interested
shareholder" of Cardinal as defined in Section 302A.011, Subdivision 49, of
the MBCA. Sarg and its Subsidiaries, affiliates and associates do not

have been issued by licensed insurers, all premiums with respect thereto
covering all periods up to and including the Closing Date have been paid, and
no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any

aggregate, a Sarg Material Adverse Effect. Except as has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sarg
Material Adverse Effect, each of Sarg and its Subsidiaries is, and since
January 1, 2015 has been, insured with respect to its assets and properties

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExcept (a) as set forth in the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule and (b) as
otherwise disclosed or identified in the Cardinal SEC Documents publicly filed
or furnished after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (other than
(i) any forward-looking disclosures contained in the "Forward Looking
Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Cardinal SEC Documents and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily
predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature and (ii) information
included in, or incorporated by reference as, exhibits and schedules to any

 \t\t\t4.1 Corporate Organization. Cardinal is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Minnesota and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Each of Cardinal's Subsidiaries is a corporation or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable,
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has the requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to own, lease
and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Cardinal Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the articles of incorporation
(the "Cardinal Charter") and bylaws (the "Cardinal Bylaws") of Cardinal, as
most recently filed with the Cardinal SEC Documents are true, complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. Cardinal is not in material violation of any of the provisions of
the Cardinal Charter or the Cardinal Bylaws. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2 Cardinal Capitalization. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The authorized capital stock of Cardinal consists of two
hundred million (200,000,000) shares of Cardinal Common Stock and two hundred
fifty thousand (250,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share
("Cardinal Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on October 26,
2017, (i) 11,624,035 shares of Cardinal Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of Cardinal Common Stock were
held by its Subsidiaries, (iii) 473,603 shares of Cardinal Common Stock were
issuable (and such number was reserved for issuance) upon exercise of Cardinal
Stock Options granted under the Cardinal Stock Plans, with such Cardinal Stock
Options having a weighted average exercise price of $57.99, (iv) 260,016
shares of Cardinal RSUs granted under the Cardinal Stock Plans and (v) no
shares of Cardinal Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Except as set
forth above, as of the close of business October 26, 2017 (x) Cardinal does
not have any capital stock or other Equity Interests authorized, issued or
outstanding and (y) except for Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs to
purchase not more than 733,619 shares of Cardinal Common Stock, there are no
options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character to which Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating Cardinal or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital
stock of, or other Equity Interests in, Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries.
Since the close of business on October 26, 2017, Cardinal has not issued any
shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock or
other Equity Interests, other than those shares of capital stock reserved for
issuance described in the second sentence of this Section 4.2(a) or as
expressly permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(b). Cardinal has previously
provided Sarg with a true \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t35  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tand complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which each
outstanding Cardinal Stock Option and Cardinal RSU may be exercised under the
applicable Cardinal Stock Plan, the number of Cardinal Stock Options and
Cardinal RSUs outstanding at each such price, the number of shares underlying
each award of Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs, and the vesting
schedule of the Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs (including
performance-vesting goals). None of the Cardinal Stock Options are "incentive
stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All shares of
Cardinal Common Stock subject to issuance under the applicable Cardinal Stock
Plan, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
Cardinal having the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of
Cardinal may vote. Neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any Equity Interests of
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except with respect to Cardinal RSUs, there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the voting rights of, (iii)
requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or containing any
right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the registration for
sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive right with respect to,
any shares of Cardinal Common Stock or any capital stock of, or other Equity
Interests in, Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Section 4.2(c) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of Cardinal and the
authorized, issued and outstanding Equity Interests and the jurisdiction of
organization of each such Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c)
of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, none of Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest in any other Person. Each outstanding
share of capital stock of or other Equity Interest in each Subsidiary of
Cardinal is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by
Cardinal or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all
Liens. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Cardinal or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Cardinal or any
other Person, other than guarantees by Cardinal of any indebtedness or other
obligations of any wholly owned Subsidiary of Cardinal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.3 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Cardinal has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations
under this Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the Transactions applicable to Cardinal. The
execution and delivery by Cardinal of this Agreement, the performance and
compliance by Cardinal with each of its obligations herein and the
consummation by it of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Cardinal, subject, in the case of
the Merger, to receipt of the Cardinal Shareholder Approval, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Cardinal and no other shareholder votes
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation by Cardinal of
the Transactions to which it is a party. Cardinal has duly and validly
executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Sarg and Merger Sub of this Agreement, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthis Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Board of Directors of Cardinal (the "Cardinal Board"),
at a meeting duly called and held, unanimously adopted resolutions, which have
not been amended or withdrawn, (i) approving this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests
of, Cardinal and its shareholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be
submitted to the shareholders of Cardinal for adoption, (iv) recommending that
its shareholders adopt this Agreement and (v) declaring that this Agreement is
advisable (the "Cardinal Recommendation"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
in Section 3.21, to the Knowledge of Cardinal, no Takeover Law applies to the
Merger or the other Transactions. The only vote of holders of any class or
series of Cardinal Common Stock or other Equity Interests of Cardinal
necessary to adopt this Agreement is the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the shares of Cardinal Common Stock outstanding and
entitled to vote thereon at the Cardinal Shareholders Meeting (the "Cardinal
Shareholder Approval"). No other vote of the holders of Cardinal Common Stock
or any other Equity Interests of Cardinal is necessary to consummate the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4 No Conflicts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardinal
does not and will not, and the performance of this Agreement by Cardinal and
the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i) assuming the Cardinal
Shareholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any provision of
the Cardinal Charter or the Cardinal Bylaws or any equivalent organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of Cardinal, (ii) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and permits described in Section 4.4(b) have been
obtained and all filings and notifications described in Section 4.4(b) have
been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired,
conflict with or violate any Law applicable to any of Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or approval
under, result in any breach of or any loss or impairment of any benefit under,
constitute a change of control or default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Cardinal or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract or Permit, except, with respect
to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Cardinal Material Adverse
Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardinal
does not and will not, and the consummation by Cardinal of the Transactions to
which it is a party and compliance by Cardinal with any of the terms or
provisions hereof or thereof will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

Securities Act, any applicable blue sky Law and the rules and regulations of
the NASDAQ (ii) under the HSR Act, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger
as required by the MBCA or any other filings and approvals required by the
MBCA, (iv) such filings as may be required in connection with any Taxes and
(v) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications to a Person other than a
Governmental Entity, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Except for the Educational Consents set forth in Section
4.4(c) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, which schedule shall identify the
Educational Consents to be obtained prior to Closing (the "Cardinal Pre-
Closing Educational Consents") and the Educational Consents to be obtained
following Closing, no material filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be made by
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries or any Cardinal School with, nor are any
required to be obtained by Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries or any Cardinal
School from, any Educational Agency, in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries or the consummation of the Merger or the other
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.5 SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Cardinal has timely filed or furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, statements, registration statements, prospectuses and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by Cardinal with the SEC under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2015 (the "Cardinal SEC
Documents"). None of the Subsidiaries of Cardinal is required to make or
makes any filings with the SEC. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended, as of
the date of the last amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, each
Cardinal SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Cardinal
SEC Document did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The consolidated financial statements of Cardinal included
in the Cardinal SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) and all related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by
Cardinal's accountants with respect thereto (the "Cardinal SEC Financial
Statements"), as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Cardinal SEC Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects,
the financial condition and the results of operations, cash flows and changes
in shareholders' equity of Cardinal (on a consolidated basis) as of the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Cardinal SEC
Financial Statements, and were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto), subject, in the case of interim Cardinal SEC Financial
Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (which are not material in
significance or amount) and the absence of notes. The books and records of
Cardinal and its Subsidiaries are accurate and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tcomplete, in all material respects, have been maintained in accordance
with sound business practices and accurately present and reflect in all
material respects all of the transactions and actions therein described and
the Cardinal SEC Financial Statements have been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with such books and records. No financial statements
of any Person other than Cardinal and its Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to
be included in the consolidated financial statements of Cardinal. Except as
required by GAAP, Cardinal has not, between June 30, 2017 and the date of
this Agreement, made or adopted any material change in its accounting methods,
practices or policies in effect on June 30, 2017. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Cardinal is in compliance in all material respects with (i)
the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Cardinal has made available to Sarg true and complete
copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since
January 1, 2015 relating to the Cardinal SEC Documents and all written
responses of Cardinal thereto other than with respect to requests for
confidential treatment or which are otherwise publicly available on the SEC's
EDGAR system. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Cardinal SEC Documents and none of the Cardinal SEC Documents
(other than confidential treatment requests) is the subject of ongoing SEC
review. There are no internal investigations, any SEC inquiries or
investigations or other governmental inquiries or investigations, to the
Knowledge of Cardinal, pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of Cardinal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Cardinal has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and
paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Cardinal's disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by Cardinal in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
Cardinal's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Cardinal's management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Cardinal's disclosure controls
and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Cardinal SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q,
or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on Cardinal's
management's most recently completed evaluation of Cardinal's internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, (i) Cardinal had no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Cardinal's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) Cardinal does not have Knowledge of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Cardinal's internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2015, none of Cardinal, Cardinal's
auditors, the Cardinal Board or the audit committee of the Cardinal Board has
received \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t39  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany written (or to the Knowledge of Cardinal, oral) complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Cardinal or its Subsidiaries, or their
respective internal accounting controls or any other matter set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Cardinal and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued or required to be reflected in Cardinal's financial
statements in accordance with GAAP), except (i) as disclosed, reflected or
reserved against in the most recent audited balance sheet included in the
Cardinal SEC Financial Statements or the notes thereto, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of
the most recent audited balance sheet included in the Cardinal SEC Financial
Statements, (iii) for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions and (iv)
for liabilities and obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Cardinal Material
Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31,
2016 and through the date of this Agreement, (a) Cardinal and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and (b) there has not
been any change, event, development, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.7 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Cardinal for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, and at any
time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it or any amendment or supplement is mailed to holders of the shares
of Cardinal Common Stock and at the time of the Cardinal Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading (except that no representation or
warranty is made by Cardinal to such portions thereof that relate expressly to
Sarg and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or to statements made therein
based on information supplied by or on behalf of Sarg for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein). The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
other applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.8 Legal Proceedings. There are no Proceedings pending, or to
the Knowledge of Cardinal, threatened against Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, rights or properties or any of
the directors or officers of Cardinal, except, in each case, for those that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be

 \t\t\t4.17 Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Section 4.17(a) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all (i) issued patents and pending
patent applications, (ii) trademark and service mark registrations and
applications, (iii) copyright registrations and applications, and (iv)
material internet domain name registrations, in each case that are owned by
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Cardinal Registered
Intellectual Property"). With respect to each item required to be listed in
Section 4.17(a) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, (A) either Cardinal or
one of its Subsidiaries is the sole owner and possesses all right, title and
interest in and to the item, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), and (B) to the Knowledge of Cardinal, no Proceeding is pending or
threatened that challenges the legality, validity, enforceability,
registration, use or ownership of the item (except for office actions by the
applicable Governmental Entities in the normal course of prosecution efforts
in connection with applications for the registration or issuance of
Intellectual Property). Each item of Cardinal Registered Intellectual
Property that is shown as registered, filed, issued, or applied for in Section
4.17(a) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule has been duly registered in, filed
in or issued by the official governmental registers and/or issuers (or
officially recognized registers or issuers) for such Intellectual Property and
each such registration, filing, issuance and/or application (x) has not been
abandoned or cancelled, (y) has been maintained effective by all requisite
filings, renewals and payments, and (z) remains in full force and effect, and
each item of Cardinal Registered Intellectual Property that is shown as
registered or issued is, to the Knowledge of Cardinal, valid and
enforceable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect,
each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries owns and possesses all right, title and
interest in and to (or has the right pursuant to a valid and enforceable
license) all Intellectual Property that is necessary for or used or held for
use in the conduct of the business of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries in
substantially the same manner as presently conducted and currently proposed to
be conducted. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Cardinal, nor the performance of this Agreement by Cardinal, will result in
the loss, forfeiture, termination, or impairment of, or give rise to a right
of any Person to limit, terminate, or consent to the continued use of, any
rights of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries in any Cardinal Material
Intellectual Property. No Cardinal Material Intellectual Property owned by
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding consent,
settlement, or Order prohibiting or restricting Cardinal's or any of its
Subsidiaries' use, ownership, disposition or other exploitation thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect,
neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their
businesses is, or was during the past three (3) years, infringing,
misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property
rights of any Person. Neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any charge, complaint, claim, \t\t

 \t\t\tdemand, or notice in writing since January 1, 2013 (or earlier, if
presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation,
dilution, or violation (including any claim that Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property
rights of any Person), in each case that would be material and adverse to
Cardinal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of
Cardinal, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating any Intellectual Property owned by Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or
asserted any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice since January 1, 2013
(or earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement,
misappropriation, dilution, or violation with respect to any Cardinal Material
Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Cardinal and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable steps to maintain, police and protect the Intellectual Property
that is material to their business ("Cardinal Material Intellectual
Property"). All Cardinal Material Intellectual Property that derives
independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally
known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its
disclosure or use has been maintained in confidence in accordance with
protection procedures that are adequate for protection, and in accordance with
procedures customarily used in the industry to protect rights of like
importance. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, there has been no unauthorized use
or disclosure of any confidential Cardinal Material Intellectual Property. To
the Knowledge of Cardinal, all former and current officers, directors,
employees, consultants, advisors, and independent contractors of Cardinal and
its Subsidiaries, and each of their predecessors, who have contributed to or
participated in the conception and development of Cardinal Material
Intellectual Property for such entities have entered into valid and binding
proprietary rights agreements with Cardinal or one of its Subsidiaries or
predecessors, vesting ownership of such Intellectual Property in Cardinal or
one of its Subsidiaries, without any restrictions or obligations on Cardinal
or its Subsidiaries' use, ownership, disposition or other exploitation of such
Cardinal Material Intellectual Property. No such Person has asserted, and to
the Knowledge of Cardinal, no such Person has, any right, title, interest or
other claim in, or the right to receive any royalties or other consideration
with respect to, any such Cardinal Material Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The IT Assets of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries (i) are
sufficient for the needs of their businesses in all material respects
(including with respect to the number of license seats) and (ii) operate in
all material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional
specifications and as required by Cardinal and its Subsidiaries and have not,
in the last three (3) years, materially malfunctioned or failed such that it
resulted in a disruption to the conduct of the business. Cardinal and its
Subsidiaries have implemented commercially reasonable measures, to protect the
confidentiality and security of such IT Assets and information stored or
contained therein against any unauthorized use, access, interruption or
corruption. Cardinal and its Subsidiaries have implemented commercially
reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster avoidance
procedures with respect to their IT Assets. To the Knowledge of Cardinal,
there have not been any incidents of security breaches to, or other material
unauthorized access to or use of, (i) any of its IT Assets (including with
respect to any data or other information stored or contained therein or
accessed, transmitted or processed thereby), or (ii) any data, trade secrets
or other confidential information of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any business information and/or personally-identifying information
or data of any Person. \t\t

Property, which is distributed to any third party by or on behalf of Cardinal
or its Subsidiaries (other than software identified as belonging to a third
party and subject to a third party paid or public license), or for which
Cardinal or its Subsidiaries have current plans to distribute to any third
party, incorporates or is comprised of or distributed with any publicly
available software, or is otherwise subject to the provisions of any "open
source" or third party license agreement that (i) requires the distribution of
source code in connection with the distribution of such software in object
code form; (ii) materially limits Cardinal's or any of its Subsidiaries'
freedom to seek full compensation in connection with marketing, licensing, and
distributing such applications; or (iii) allows a customer or requires that a
customer have the right to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse
engineer the software by its terms and not by operation of law. With respect
to each item of software included in the Cardinal Material Intellectual
Property, either Cardinal or one of its Subsidiaries is (or will be at
Closing) in actual possession and control of the applicable source code,
object code, code writes, notes, documentation, programmers' source code
annotations, user manuals and know-how to the extent required for use,
distribution, development, enhancement, maintenance and support of such
software, subject to any licenses granted to third parties therein. \t\t

Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate \t\t

 \t\t\tamendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of Cardinal and the stockholders of Sarg, as applicable;
provided, however, that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any
such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereunder (except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.7 or Section 4.7, as
applicable) or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.
Except for the purpose of disclosing either a Sarg Adverse Recommendation
Change or Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as the case may be, no
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, nor any
response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC with respect to such filings,
will be made by Sarg or Cardinal without the approval of the other party,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Each party shall notify the other party promptly of the time when the Form S-4
has become effective, and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of
the qualification of the shares of Sarg Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. In addition, each
party agrees to provide the other party and their respective counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform the other party of any oral
comments, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Each party and their respective counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and each party shall give due
consideration to the additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
other party and their respective counsel. \t\t

its shareholders (the "Sarg Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking
the Sarg Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that Sarg may postpone or
adjourn the Sarg Stockholders Meeting (A) with the prior written consent of
Cardinal; (B) if a quorum has not been established; (C) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Sarg Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
Sarg stockholders prior to the Sarg Stockholders Meeting; (D) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent
the requisite Sarg Stockholder Approval would not otherwise be obtained; or
(E) if required by Law; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (B),
(C), (D) and (E), the Sarg Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned for more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the Sarg Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Cardinal. Sarg shall, upon the reasonable request of
Cardinal, advise Cardinal at least on a daily basis on each of the last seven

in a manner adverse to Cardinal, the approval, determination of advisability,
or recommendation by the Sarg Board of, the Sarg Share Issuance and the
Amended Sarg Charter, (y) make, or permit any director or executive officer

 \t\t\t(iii) Notwithstanding any Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Cardinal shall, through the Cardinal Board, make the Cardinal

Except as expressly permitted in Section 5.4(b) and Section 5.4(d), neither

 \t\t\t(iii) Notwithstanding any Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the Merger shall
be submitted to the shareholders of Cardinal for approval at the Cardinal

efforts to hold the Sarg Stockholders Meeting and the Cardinal Shareholders
Meeting on the same date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.4 No Solicitation of Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each of Sarg and Cardinal shall immediately cease, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately
cease, any discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing
with respect to a Competing Proposal, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Competing Proposal, and shall request to have promptly returned or
destroyed, as applicable, any information that has been provided to any Person
in connection with any such discussions or negotiations that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 7, each of Sarg and Cardinal shall not,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce
(including by way of furnishing information which has not been previously
publicly disseminated), or take any other action that could reasonably be
expected to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal, or (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Competing Proposal; provided, however, that if, prior to obtaining the Sarg
Stockholder Approval (in the case of Sarg) or the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval (in the case of Cardinal) and following the receipt of a bona fide
written unsolicited Competing Proposal made after the date hereof and the Sarg
Board or the Cardinal Board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after
receiving advice of its financial advisor and of its outside legal counsel) is
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was
not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in
violation of this Section 5.4, the Sarg Board or the Cardinal Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such Competing
Proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to
Sarg under applicable Law (in the case of the Sarg Board) or the directors'
fiduciary duties to Cardinal's shareholders under applicable Law (in the case
of the Cardinal Board), then Sarg or Cardinal may, in response to such
Competing Proposal, as applicable, and subject to compliance with Section
5.4(c), (A) furnish information with respect to Sarg or Cardinal, as
applicable, to the Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Competing Proposal. Except as
expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, each of Cardinal and Sarg shall not,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article
7, directly or indirectly (1) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or
propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal or any
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing
Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); (2) take any action to make
the provisions of any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Competing Proposal; or (3) terminate, amend, release, modify
or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver
or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered
into by the applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing
Proposal (other than to the extent \t\t

good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take any of such actions under clause (3) would be inconsistent with the
directors' duties under applicable Law), or (4) propose to do any of the
foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.4(a) shall
relieve any party from its obligations under Section 5.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
including Section 5.3, but subject to compliance with this Section 5.4, prior
to obtaining the Sarg Stockholder Approval (in the case of Sarg) or the
Cardinal Shareholder Approval (in the case of Cardinal) and following the
receipt of a bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof
that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly
encouraged in violation of this Section 5.4, the Sarg Board or the Cardinal
Board, as applicable, may effect a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change within
the meaning of clauses (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the definition thereof or a
Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change within the meaning of clauses (x), (y)
and (z)(2) of the definition thereof, as applicable or terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(iv) or Section 7.1(d)(iv), as applicable, or both, but in each
case if and only if (i) the Sarg Board or the Cardinal Board, as applicable,
concludes in good faith, after consultation with Sarg's or Cardinal's outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as
applicable, provides the other party five (5) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (a "Competing Proposal Notice"),
which notice shall include the information with respect to such Competing
Proposal that is specified in Section 5.4(c), as well as a copy of such
Competing Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice
by a party nor any public announcement thereof that such party determines it
is required to make under applicable Law shall constitute a Sarg Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, unless and until such party shall have failed at or prior to the
end of the period referred to in clause (iii) below (and, upon the occurrence
of such failure, such notice and such public announcement shall constitute a
Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the
Transactions and (B) has determined that such other Competing Proposal (taking
into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the Transactions
agreed to by the other party in writing and (y) any modifications or
adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal
and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii) during the five (5)
Business Days following such written notice (the "Negotiation Period"), if
requested by the other party, the Board of Directors of the applicable Party
proposing to effect the recommendation change and its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions proposed by the other party in response to such
Competing Proposal; and (iv) at the end of the Negotiation Period, the Sarg
Board or Cardinal Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with Sarg's or Cardinal's outside legal counsel and financial
advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement to which the other party has agreed in writing to make to
the terms of the Transactions), that the Competing Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with Sarg's or Cardinal's outside
legal counsel, as applicable, that the failure to make such a Sarg Adverse
Recommendation Change or Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the exercise, in the case of the Sarg
Board, of the directors' duties to Sarg under applicable Law or, in the case
of the Cardinal Board, of the directors' fiduciary duties to the \t\t

 \t\t\tshareholders of Cardinal under applicable Law. Any material amendment
or modification to any Competing Proposal shall require a new Competing
Proposal Notice and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional
three (3) Business Days from the date of receipt of such new Competing
Proposal Notice. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In addition to the obligations of Cardinal and Sarg set
forth in Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b), Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable,
shall promptly, and in any event no later than 24 hours, after it (x) receives
(i) any Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to Cardinal or Sarg or their respective Subsidiaries other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal or
(y) responds thereto, notify the other party orally and in writing of any of
the foregoing occurrences, the identity of the Person making such request,
inquiry or Competing Proposal and a copy of such request, inquiry, response or
Competing Proposal (or where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed
description of such request, inquiry, response or Competing Proposal),
including any modifications thereto. Each party shall keep the other party
reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any
event at the other party's request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after
the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations) of the status of any request, inquiry, response or Competing
Proposal (including the terms and conditions thereof and of any modification
thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations,
including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, material correspondence
and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify the other party orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning a Competing Proposal pursuant to
Section 5.4. Each of Cardinal and Sarg agrees that, subject to applicable
restrictions under applicable Law, it shall, prior to or concurrent with the
time it is provided to any third parties, provide to the other party any non-
public information concerning Cardinal or Sarg and their respective
Subsidiaries that Cardinal or Sarg provided to any third party in connection
with any Competing Proposal which was not previously provided to the other
party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Cardinal Shareholder Approval or
the Sarg Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Cardinal Board or the Sarg
Board, as applicable, may make a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if (i) such board
determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii)
such board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to make a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, in response to such Intervening
Event would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to Sarg under
applicable Law (in the case of the Sarg Board) or the directors' fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable Law (in the case of the Cardinal
Board), as applicable; provided that (x) the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board,
as applicable, has given the other party at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the circumstances related to such determination and (y)
prior to effecting a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, the applicable party has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other
party during such notice period to the extent such other party wishes to \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tnegotiate, to enable such party to revise the terms of this Agreement,
such that the failure to make such a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or
a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would not be inconsistent
with the directors' duties under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board from (i) taking and disclosing to their
shareholders, as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making any disclosure to their shareholders, as applicable, if the Sarg
Board or Cardinal Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to shareholders
under, or would violate applicable Law; or (iii) making accurate disclosure to
their shareholders, as applicable, of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Cardinal or Sarg or
the fact that a Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change
or a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable), so long as (A) any
such disclosure includes the Cardinal Recommendation or the Sarg
Recommendation, as applicable, without any modification or qualification
thereof and continues the prior recommendation of the Cardinal Board or Sarg
Board, as the case may be, and (B) does not contain either an express Cardinal
Adverse Recommendation Change or an express Sarg Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, or any other statements by or on behalf of the Board of
Directors of such party which would reasonably be expected to have the same
effect as a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Any failure of Cardinal's or Sarg's respective Subsidiaries
or its and their respective Representatives to fully comply with this Section
5.4 (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were directly subject to this
Section 5.4) shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.4 by Cardinal or
Sarg, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) For purposes of this Agreement: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the Transactions,
any proposal, offer or inquiry from a third party relating to (A) a merger,
reorganization, sale or license of assets, share exchange, tender offer,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Cardinal or Sarg,
as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; (B) the acquisition
(whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or
otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated
assets of Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, and their respective Subsidiaries,
as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis; (C) the purchase or
acquisition, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the Cardinal
Common Stock or the Sarg Common Stock, as applicable, or any other Equity
Interests in Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, (D) any purchase, acquisition,
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially \t\t

Stock or Sarg Common Stock, as applicable or any other Equity Interests of
Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (E) any combination
of the foregoing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) "Intervening Event" means any positive material event,
development or change in circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes
known to Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, or its respective Board of Directors
after the date of this Agreement, to the extent that such event, development
or change in circumstances was not known or reasonably foreseeable as of the
date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability
of magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable); provided, however, that in no event shall the following events,
developments or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (1)
the receipt, existence or terms of a Competing Proposal or any matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof; (2) any change in the price, or change in
trading volume, of Cardinal Common Stock or Sarg Common Stock, as applicable
(provided, however, that the exception set forth in this clause (2) shall not
apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such change
or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); (3) meeting or
exceeding internal or analysts' expectations, projections or results of
operations (provided, however, that the exception set forth in this clause (3)
shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to
such circumstances or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken
into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); and
(4) any action taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the
affirmative covenants set forth in Section 5.6, and the consequences of any
such action. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Competing
Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "80%")
made by a third party which was not solicited by Cardinal or Sarg or any of
their respective Representatives and which, in the good faith judgment of the
Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as applicable, and after consultation with
its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the Competing Proposal, including
the financing terms thereof, and the third party making such Competing
Proposal in addition to such other factors as the Cardinal Board or the Sarg
Board, as applicable, considers to be appropriate, (A) if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to Cardinal's shareholders or Sarg
stockholders, as applicable, from a financial point of view, than the Merger
and the other Transactions contemplated hereby (after giving effect to all
adjustments or modifications to the terms thereof which may be agreed in
writing to be made by the other party (including pursuant to Section 5.4(b)))
and (C) if a cash transaction (in whole or in part), financing for which is
then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available. \t\t

other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities Laws (other than
reports or documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable Law) and (ii) consistent with its obligations under applicable Law,
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
other party may reasonably request; provided, however, none of Cardinal or
Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where such information
or access would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (x) breach any
agreement with any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
or other privilege held by such party or (z) otherwise violate any applicable
Law. In the event any of the restrictions in clauses (x) through (z) of the
foregoing sentence shall apply, the parties shall advise the other party of
the subject matter of any such information that cannot be disclosed and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable
Laws. Any such information provided pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be
held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 1, 2017
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Cardinal and Sarg, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of any other party set forth herein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.6 Appropriate Action. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts
to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, including under any Contract to which Cardinal or
Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries is party or by which such Person
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities (including, without limitation,
those in connection with the HSR Act), make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity or Educational Agency (including, the Cardinal Pre-Closing Educational
Consents and the Sarg Pre-Closing Educational Consents (if any) and in
connection with the HSR Act), and (iii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthe "reasonable best efforts" of any party include the obligation to
defend or prosecute any suit, arbitration or other adversarial proceeding (in
each case, whether judicial, arbitral or administrative) by or against any
Governmental Entity or any Educational Agency. Each of the parties shall
furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
Cardinal and Sarg shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each party shall consult with the other party in connection with,
all of the information relating to Cardinal or Sarg, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
or Educational Agency in connection with the Merger and the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Cardinal and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements;
and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of Cardinal and Sarg shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity or
Educational Agency, Cardinal and Sarg shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other party with copies of
notices or other written substantive communications received by Cardinal or
Sarg, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity, Educational Agency and/or third party with respect to the
Transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall
provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency in respect of
any substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Cardinal and Sarg shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, make
or cause to be made (i) all filings required under the HSR Act with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement and (ii) (A) the filing no
later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement a Preacquisition
Review Application in respect of each Title IV Cardinal School to the extent
that such filing has not been made in respect of a Title IV Cardinal School
prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) the filing, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event by December 1, 2017, of a materially complete
change of control or substantive change application with the HLC with respect
of each HLC-accredited Cardinal School, as applicable, (C) the prompt use of
Sarg's and Cardinal's respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Cardinal Pre-Closing Educational Consents and any Sarg Pre-Closing Educational
Consents which efforts shall include the prompt filing of all required
applications, notices, reports and other filings, and (D) the filing, as
promptly as practicable, of any notice of the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with any Educational Agency from which an Educational Approval
is currently in effect for any Cardinal School and from which an Educational
Consent is not required until after the Closing. In addition, and without
limiting the foregoing, Sarg and the Sarg Schools shall, to the extent
specifically required by any Educational Agency, submit any application,
report or other filing requested by any Educational Agency with respect to the
Transactions, whether before or after the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a
Governmental Entity, neither Cardinal or Sarg (nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates) shall be required to \t\t

in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of
or conduct their businesses in a specified manner, or enter into or agree to
enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement, "hold separate"
agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to
the assets, operations or conduct of their business in a specified manner, or
permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of
Cardinal or Sarg or their respective Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 5.6(b) does not apply to any Educational Approvals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.7 Certain Notices. Each party shall give prompt notice to the
other parties if any of the following occur after the date of this Agreement:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity, Educational Agency or the NASDAQ
(or any other securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c)
such party becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or
delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not cure any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. Sarg and Cardinal shall promptly provide, to the
extent not publicly available, the other party with copies of all filings made
by such party with any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency in connection
with the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8 Public Announcements. Each party agrees that no public
release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any
party without the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
(x) to the extent such release or announcement may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance or
(y) in the case of any release or announcement in connection with a Competing
Proposal, a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change or a Cardinal Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, and otherwise not in violation of
Section 5.4. Cardinal and Sarg agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release in the form
heretofore agreed by the parties. In addition, subject to the right of the
Cardinal Board to make a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or the Sarg
Board to make a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in accordance
with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5.4, Cardinal and Sarg
agree to cause their respective directors and officers to refrain from taking
any position in any public statement that is (a) contrary to the positions
previously taken by Sarg and Cardinal with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, or (b) reasonably likely to have an
material adverse impact on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From and after the Effective Time, Sarg shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i)
applicable Law, (ii) Cardinal's and Sarg's organizational documents in effect
as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) any Contract of Cardinal, Sarg or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, each present and former director and officer of Cardinal, Sarg and
any of their respective Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Sarg agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) now existing in favor of
an Indemnitee as provided in its articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time, Sarg shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
organizational documents of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of
Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall purchase a
"tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable to the insured Persons in the aggregate
with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events that occurred
before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and the other Transactions) than the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Cardinal if the cost thereof does not exceed 300% of the last annual premium
paid by Cardinal for the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by Cardinal before the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that if Cardinal is unable to so acquire such a "tail"
policy then Sarg shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Cardinal or
policies with coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous insured Persons with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events that occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transactions) so long as Cardinal or the Surviving Corporation are not
required to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by Sarg for such insurance before the date of this Agreement
(such 300% amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If Cardinal is unable to
obtain \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t77  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthe "tail" policy and Sarg or the Surviving Corporation are unable to
obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than
or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Sarg shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In the event that either Sarg or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Sarg
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under Cardinal's, Sarg's or any of their respective
Subsidiaries' organizational documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or in any Contract of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The obligations of
Sarg and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries for
any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Sarg shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Sarg Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger (including shares of Sarg Common Stock to be issued upon
exercise of Sarg Stock Options or vesting of Sarg Restricted Stock Awards,
Sarg Performance Restricted Stock Awards, Sarg RSUs or Sarg Performance
Units), to be listed on the NASDAQ (or such other stock exchange as may be
mutually agreed upon by Cardinal and Sarg), subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the respective Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal
and Sarg shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Cardinal Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Cardinal Common Stock) or acquisitions of Sarg Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Sarg Common Stock) resulting
from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Cardinal, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.12 Shareholder Litigation. Each of Cardinal and Sarg shall
provide the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
litigation brought by shareholders of Cardinal or stockholders of Sarg or in
the name of Cardinal or Sarg against Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, and/or
their respective directors relating to the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger ("Transaction Litigation"); provided,
however, that no party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement
regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding
any litigation arising or resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of the
other party (not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned of delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.13 Tax Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the parties shall (and each of the
parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or
fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties shall consider in good faith such amendments to this
Agreement as may be reasonably required to cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (it being
understood that no party will be required to agree to any such
amendment). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Tax opinions to be attached as exhibits to the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 and the Tax opinions described in Sections 6.2(d)
and 6.3(d), including by (i) delivering to Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Latham and
Watkins LLP, prior to the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4, tax representation letters in substantially the forms set forth in
Section 5.13(b)(i) of the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and Section 5.13(b)(i) of
the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, respectively, and (ii) delivering to
Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP, dated and executed as of the
dates of such Tax opinions, tax representation letters in substantially the
forms set forth in Section 5.13(b)(ii) of the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and
Section 5.13(b)(ii) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, respectively. Each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts not to, and not permit any
affiliate to, take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be
untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction
would cause to be untrue) any of the representations and covenants made to
counsel in the tax representation letters described in this Section
5.13(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties
hereto adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code. The parties shall treat the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for United
States federal, state and other relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.14 Employee Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Sarg and Cardinal agree to the general terms set forth on
Section 5.14(a) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule. To the extent permitted
by applicable Laws, Sarg \t\t

 \t\t\tshall credit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to credit, each employee of Sarg, Cardinal or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as of the Closing (including any employee who is full-
time, part-time, temporary, on vacation or on a medical or disability or any
other paid or unpaid approved leave of absence) who continues employment with
Sarg or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (each, a
"Continuing Employee") with his or her years of service with Sarg, Cardinal
or any of their respective Subsidiaries and predecessor entities, under any
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which such Continuing
Employee participates following the Closing (the "Post-Closing Plan"), to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the
Closing to credit for such service under any similar Sarg Benefit Plan or
Cardinal Benefit Plan, for purposes of eligibility for participation and
vesting (but not accrual of benefits, other than for purposes of determining
the level of vacation, travel and/or severance benefits), except to the extent
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no service prior to the Closing Date shall be required to be
credited for the purpose of benefit accrual or eligibility for any defined
benefit pension plan, early retirement benefits or subsidies or participation
under any defined benefit pension plan, nor for purposes of eligibility or
participation under any retiree medical plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In addition, and without limiting the generality of Section
5.14(a), this Section 5.14(b) or any other provisions herein, (i) for purposes
of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision
and/or other health benefits to any Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, Sarg shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work
requirements of such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work requirements were waived or were
inapplicable under the comparable Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan,
(ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-
payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision benefit plans of Sarg or Cardinal (or their respective Subsidiaries),
as applicable, prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing
occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing
Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for such plan year under any Pre-Closing Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision or health benefits, as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any Post-Closing Plan that is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Continuing Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of a Sarg
Benefit Plan or a Cardinal Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan shall be
eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Sarg or the Surviving
Corporation following the Closing (each, a "Post-Closing 401(k) Plan") and
shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting service for all periods
of service with Sarg and Cardinal, and their respective Subsidiaries to the
extent so credited with such service under the applicable 401(k) plan as of
the Closing Date. Additionally, in the event Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries
freezes a 401(k) plan after the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
who \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tparticipates in such frozen plan shall, following such action, become
eligible to participate in a Post-Closing 401(k) Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 5.14 or otherwise in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Sarg or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any
Continuing Employee for any reason in their sole business discretion, (ii) to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement (including any Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan), or
(iii) require Sarg or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
to continue any Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan or prevent or
interfere with the rights of Sarg, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries with respect to the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 5.14 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing
Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no
provision of this Section 5.14 shall create such rights in any such
persons. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.15 Interim Financial Reports \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, Sarg
shall furnish to Cardinal promptly after the end of each week (or, where
indicated in Section 5.15(a) of the Sarg Disclosure Schedule, the end of each
month), a copy of a financial report (the "Sarg Financial Report") for such
period, the form of which is set forth in Section 5.15(a) of the Sarg
Disclosure Schedule. Cardinal agrees that it shall: (i) maintain all Sarg
Financial Reports in strict confidence in accordance with the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) not disclose or make available to any
directors, officers, employees, members, partners, agents or employees of
Cardinal other than the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer
and general counsel of Cardinal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
Cardinal shall furnish to Sarg promptly after the end of each week (or, where
indicated in Section 5.15(b) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, the end of
each month) a copy of a financial report (the "Cardinal Financial Report") for
such period, the form of which is set forth in Section 5.15(b) of the Cardinal
Disclosure Schedule. Sarg agrees that it shall: (i) maintain all Cardinal
Financial Reports in strict confidence in accordance with the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) not disclose or make available to any
directors, officers, employees, members, partners, agents or employees of Sarg
other than the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and
general counsel of Sarg. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) None of the information provided pursuant to Section
5.15(a) or Section 5.15(b) shall affect any of the representations or
warranties of the parties, and by providing such information no party shall be
deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. \t\t

shareholders, directors, officers, affiliates and other Representatives, for
any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or

Sarg Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment
thereof in such circumstances is supported by due and sufficient
consideration; provided, that no payment of a Cardinal Termination Fee or a

 \t\t\t8.5 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, the Cardinal Disclosure Schedules, the Sarg Disclosure Schedules and
the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder. Each of
Cardinal and Sarg acknowledge and agree that each such party, as applicable,
has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by any express or implied
representations or warranties other than those set forth in Article 3 (in the
case of Cardinal) and Article 4 (in the case of Sarg). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. \t\t

 \t\t\t8.9 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than
pursuant to Section 5.9, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.10 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the
feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter
gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this
Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall
not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement,
references to a "party" or the "parties" are intended to refer to a party to
this Agreement or the parties to this Agreement. Except as otherwise
indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits,"
"Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement
and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise
specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive. In this Agreement, when determining whether an item is "material"
to Cardinal or its Subsidiary or Sarg or its Subsidiary, the term "material"
shall be interpreted to mean, as applicable, "Material to the business of
Cardinal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole" or "material to the business
of Sarg and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.11 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement, and any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland, without
regard to choice or conflict of Law principles thereof; except that (i) any
provisions of this Agreement which implicate the fiduciary duties of directors
or officers of a Minnesota limited liability company, corporation or entity
shall be governed by and in accordance with the Laws of Minnesota; (ii) to the
extent the authorization, effectiveness or effect of the Merger or the
Transactions are required by statute or public policy to be governed by the
Laws of Minnesota, then the internal Laws of Minnesota shall govern and apply,
but only as to such matters and to the limited extent necessary to comply with
and cause the Merger to be effective under the Laws of Minnesota. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Maryland state or federal court, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such
courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be
heard and determined any Maryland state or federal court, (iii) waives, to

 \t\t\tfullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Proceeding in any such court. Each of the parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.11(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.13 Delivery by Facsimile or Email. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder, to
the extent signed and delivered by facsimile or by email with scan attachment,
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall
be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party, each other party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver
them to all other parties. No party shall raise the use of facsimile or email
to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was
transmitted or communicated by facsimile or email with scan attachment as a
defense to the formation of a legally binding contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.14 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tStates or any state or foreign jurisdiction having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The parties waive, in connection with any action for specific
performance or injunctive relief, the defense of adequacy of remedies at Law
and any requirement under Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.15 Disclosure Schedules. The parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules
that are not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the
convenience of parties, (b) the disclosure by the parties of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by
any party that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement or that the matter is material or significant, (c) if any section of
the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or information in such a way as to make
its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another section of
the Disclosure Schedules or the statements contained in any Section of this
Agreement reasonably apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have been
disclosed in or with respect to such other section, notwithstanding the
omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the
omission of a reference in the particular representation and warranty to such
section of the Disclosure Schedules; provided that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary provided elsewhere herein, any item or information disclosed
pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 4.1,
4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.19, 4.20, or 4.21 shall be disclosed solely in the
corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedule, and not by any other section
thereof or any Sarg SEC Document or Cardinal SEC Document, as applicable, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the Disclosure
Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions
of this Agreement and (f) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and
statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the parties except
as and to the extent provided in this Agreement. \t\t
