SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") or any capital stock of Merger Sub:



(a) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to this Article II, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c)),
together with each associated "Right" (as defined in the Rights Agreement,
dated as of September 9, 1997, between the Company and EquiServe Trust

Price (without interest), payable upon the surrender of the Certificates (as
defined in Section 2.2(b)) (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). "Share
Price" means $22.25 per share. All such shares of Company Common Stock, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Share Price pursuant to this
Section 2.1(a).



(b)  _Company Preferred Stock_. Any outstanding shares of Preferred stock (as
defined herein) shall be cancelled and all authorized shares of Preferred
Stock shall be eliminated at the Effective Time.

Company Common Stock, together with each associated "Right" (as defined in the
Company Rights Plan), that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or
(ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of
Parent shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no securities of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. As used
in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party,
any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
of which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general
partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which
held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of
the voting interest in such partnership), (B) such party or any Subsidiary of
such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding equity or voting
securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary of such party has
the right to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization. 



(d) _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that all outstanding purchase rights under the
Companys 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall automatically
be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and each share of Company Common Stock purchased under
those exercised rights shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Share Price pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions so that the ESPP shall terminate with such purchase, and no further
purchase rights shall be granted under the ESPP. Employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who continue in the employ of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time shall be eligible
for



 

3 participation in Parents Employee Stock Purchase Plan, if and so long as
Parent maintains such plan, in accordance with the terms, provisions and
policies thereof; _provided_ , that such employees shall be eligible to
participate in such plan as of the first entry date following the Effective
Time on which they qualify as eligible employees under such plan, with
service rendered to the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time
to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any service requirement
for such eligibility to the same extent as if such service had been rendered
to Parent.



(e) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(f) _Adjustment for Certain Events_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within such period (an "Adjustment Event") the
Merger Consideration to be paid in the Merger in exchange for each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, as provided in this Agreement, shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such Adjustment Event.



(g)  _Stock Options_. Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.8 hereof.



(h) _Appraisal Rights_.



(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
share of the Company Common Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by
a holder who has, as of the Effective Time, preserved such holders appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the GCL with respect to such share shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Share Price
in accordance with Section 2.1(a), and the holder of such share shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the GCL with respect to such share; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holder of such
share shall otherwise lose such holders appraisal rights with respect to such
share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure
to perfect such rights or the loss of such rights, such share shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share) the Share
Price in accordance with Section 2.1(a). 



(ii) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the GCL and
of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the



 

4 Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the GCL and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to
the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have
consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer or unless required by
a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of
competent jurisdiction.



SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange
Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock, the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the Merger
Consideration determined pursuant to Section 2.1(a) above, after giving effect
to any tax withholdings or deductions required by applicable law, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, a
check representing the Merger Consideration determined pursuant to Section
2.1(a) above, after giving effect to any tax withholdings or deductions
required by applicable law, shall be delivered to a transferee if the
Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the
Merger Consideration, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



 

5 (c) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any Merger Consideration which had been
made available to the Exchange Agent and which has not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law) with respect to the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for such
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law following the passage of
time specified therein.



(d) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any person who was a holder of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_ __. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ __. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as
may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. 



(g) _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with
this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and



 

6 directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.



SECTION 2.3 _Material Adverse Effect_.

circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other such
similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred prior
to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) may materially
impair the ability of Parent to operate the business of the Company
immediately after the Closing in the same manner as such business has been
operated prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such change,
event or circumstance shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to constitute a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" to the extent that the Company can show by
a preponderance of the evidence that any effect described in clause (i), (ii)
or (iii): (A) resulted solely from compliance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; (B) affected the United States or world economy generally,
and does not disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries taken

with reference to, any representation, warranty or covenant of Company
contained in this Agreement shall not be considered synonymous with the
term "Company Material Adverse Effect."



(b) The term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or
circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other such
similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred prior

both assets and liabilities), business, capitalization, condition (financial
or other) or results of operations of Parent, or (ii) may materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such change, event or circumstance shall not be deemed, in
and of itself, to constitute a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" to the extent
that Parent can show by a preponderance of the evidence that any effect
described in clause (i) or (ii): (A) resulted solely from compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; (B) affected the United States or
world economy generally, and does not disproportionately



 

7 affect Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (C) affected the

or SEC accounting rules that apply to Parent. The term "material" as used in,
or with reference to, any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent
contained in this Agreement shall not be considered synonymous with the term
"Parent Material Adverse Effect."

Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.



(f) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "Qualified Plan") have received
determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or are
entitled to rely on opinion letters issued by the IRS with respect to any
Qualified Plan that is a prototype plan to the effect that such Company
Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are
exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, no such determination or opinion letter has been
revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened
in writing, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated
since the date of its most recent determination letter or most recent
applicable opinion letter, or application therefor in any respect, and no act
or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan without
notice to and approval by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Company Employee
Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of
the Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all
material respects, the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section
401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to
the Closing Date. Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to meet
currently applicable requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter
B of Chapter 1 of the Code is in compliance with such requirements, including,
if applicable, the requirements of Sections 419 and 419A of the Code.



(g) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has at any time for which any relevant statute of limitations
remains open (i) maintained a Company Employee Plan which was subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or (ii)
contributed or been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"), and neither
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has any
liability, actual or contingent, with respect to any such plan. No Company
Employee Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or Sections 4063, 4064 and 4066 of
ERISA. No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a
"voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or ever has been part of a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement," as that term is defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA.



 

21 (h) Each Company Employee Plan (other than an employment, severance, change in
control or similar agreement with an individual) is amendable and terminable
unilaterally by the Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries party
thereto or covered thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof, and no Company Employee Plan or
related plan documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other
written communication distributed generally to employees by its terms
prohibits the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries party thereto or
covered thereby from amending or terminating any such Company Employee Plan,
or in any way limits such action except as required by applicable law.



(i) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the
Company Employee Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits
or coverage to any person following retirement or other termination of
employment.



(j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, with
respect to any Company Employee Plan, or any fiduciary or service provider
thereof with respect to any Company Employee Plan, other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course, nor is there any reasonable basis for any
such action, claim or investigation. No Company Employee Plan is or within
the last three calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice
that it is the subject of, examination by a government agency or a participant
in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.



(k) Each individual who has received compensation for the performance of
services on behalf of the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or its
ERISA Affiliates has been properly classified as an employee or independent
contractor in accordance with applicable law.



(l) Each Company Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside the
United States, and the books and records thereof, is in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of each
applicable jurisdiction. Section 3.13(l) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each
country in which the Company or any of its affiliates has operations and the
number of employees in each such country.



(m) Section 3.13(m) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete
and correct list of (i) all employment or consulting agreements with employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obligating (or potentially
obligating) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay base compensation
and bonus for 2005 in an amount exceeding $175,000; (ii) all employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have executed a non-competition
agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) all
severance agreements, programs and policies of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees, in each case with potential
obligations equal to or exceeding $100,000, excluding programs and policies
required to be



 

22 maintained by law; and (iv) all plans, programs, agreements and other
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to
its employees which contain change in control provisions including any such
plans or agreements providing for an increase in vesting of benefits by reason
of the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements have been furnished to Parent.



(n) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Employee
Plan have been timely made or are reflected on the Companys balance sheet.
There are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any
Company Employee Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such
Company Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Company Employee Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).



(o) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment or
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer. Except as set forth on Section
3.13(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no Company Employee Plan or other
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of
the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.



(p) Each Company Employee Plan which constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code is
identified as such in the Disclosure Schedule. Since December 31, 2004, each
such Company Employee Plan has been operated and maintained in accordance
with the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1 and a good
faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code with respect to
amounts deferred (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
after December 31, 2004.



SECTION 3.14 _Labor Matters_. Except as set forth on Section 3.14 of the
Disclosure Schedule, (a) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting
employment, employment practices and occupational safety and health, terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practices; (b) there are no suits or grievances pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective employees,
consultants or independent contractors, which controversies have or would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability or obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (c) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have knowledge
of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such
employees; and (d) there are no organized labor disputes, strikes, slowdowns,
work stoppages,



 

23 lockouts, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threats thereof, by or with
respect to any employees of, or consultants or independent contractors to,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 3.14 of
the Disclosure Schedule, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) to the Companys knowledge is in violation of any term of any patent
disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant
to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the
business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others, or (ii) in the case of any Key Employee (as defined below) or group
of Key Employees, has given notice as of the date of this Agreement to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that such employee or any employee in a
group of Key Employees intends to terminate his or her employment with the
Company. Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has effected (i) a
plant closing, as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification
Act of 1988, as amended ( the "WARN Act"), or (ii) a mass layoff, as defined
in the WARN Act with respect to which any liability pursuant to the WARN Act
or otherwise remains unsatisfied. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently engaged in any layoffs or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger application of the WARN Act or any similar
state, local or foreign law. As used herein, "Key Employee" means any officer
of the Company or an of its Subsidiaries that reports directly to the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company.



SECTION 3.15 _Properties; Encumbrances_ __. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all the properties and assets which it purports to own or lease
(real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible), including all the
properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet (except for
personal property sold since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). All properties
and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are free and clear of all
Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Company Balance Sheet, Liens set
forth on Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule and Permitted Liens. Section
3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list
of all real property owned, leased, subleased or licensed by the Company and
the location of such premises. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the material provisions of each lease or
sublease for the real property which is set forth in Section 3.15 of the
Disclosure Schedule.



SECTION 3.16 _Taxes_.



(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes, fees,
assessments, liabilities, levies, duties, tariffs, imposts and governmental
impositions or charges of any kind in the nature of (or similar to) taxes,
payable to any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority, or any
agency or subdivision thereof, including (i) income, franchise, profits,
gross receipts, _ad valorem,_ net worth, value added, sales, use, service,
real or personal property, special assessments, capital stock, license,
payroll, withholding, employment, social security, workers compensation,
unemployment compensation, utility, severance, production, excise, stamp,
occupation, premiums, windfall profits, transfer and gains taxes, and (ii)
interest, penalties, fines, additional taxes and additions to tax imposed
with respect thereto; and "Tax Returns" shall mean returns,



 

24 reports and information statements with respect to Taxes required to be filed
with a taxing authority, domestic or foreign, including, consolidated,
combined or unitary tax returns and any amendments to any of the foregoing.



(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed with the appropriate
taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and all such
Tax Returns were true, complete and correct in all material respects. All
Taxes due and owing by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been timely paid
except for such Taxes being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established. There are
no Tax Liens on any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof other than
liens relating to Taxes not yet due and payable. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has granted any waiver of any statute of limitations with
respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes (exclusive of any accruals for "deferred
taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between tax and
financial accounting principles) reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are
adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the date thereof (including
interest and penalties, if any, thereon and Taxes being contested) in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with the Company Balance
Sheet. All liabilities for Taxes attributable to the period commencing on the
date following the date of the Company Balance Sheet were incurred in
the ordinary course of business and are consistent in type and amount with
Taxes attributable to similar prior periods.



(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld with respect to its
employees all federal and state Taxes required to be withheld, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been delinquent in the payment of
any Tax. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of any Tax deficiency outstanding, proposed or
assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which deficiency has
not been paid, settled or adequately reserved for on the Company Balance
Sheet. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of any audit examination, deficiency, refund litigation,
proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or tax
allocation agreements with any person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except for the group of which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are now currently members, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the
meaning of Section 1504 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is liable for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.



(d) The Company has delivered to Parent (i) complete and correct copies of all
Tax Returns, examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
all taxable years for which the statutes of limitation have not expired, and
(ii) written schedules of (A) the taxable years of the Company and each
Subsidiary for which the statute of limitations with respect to income Taxes
have not expired, (B) with respect to income Taxes of the



 

25 Company and each Subsidiary, those years for which examinations have been
completed, those years for which examinations are presently being conducted,
those years for which examinations have not yet been initiated and those years
for which required Tax Returns have not yet been filed, and (C) the foreign
countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries has or has had a permanent
establishment, as defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between
the United States and such foreign country.



(e) None of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is
property that is required to be treated as being owned by any other person
pursuant to the provisions of former Section 168(f)(8) of the Code; (ii) is
"tax-exempt use of property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code;
or (iii) directly or indirectly secures any debt the interest on which is tax
exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code.



(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has undergone, or will
undergo as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, a
change in its method of accounting resulting in an adjustment to its taxable
income or loss pursuant to Section 481 of the Code.



(g) The state and federal "net operating loss" of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 is set forth on Section 3.16(g) of the
Disclosure Schedule. No state or federal "net operating loss" of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries determined as of the Closing date is subject to
limitation on its use pursuant to Section 382 of the Code or comparable
provisions of state law as a result of any "ownership change" within the
meaning of Section 382(g) of the Code or comparable provisions of any state
law occurring prior to the Closing Date.



(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger.



(i) No power of attorney granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Taxes is currently in force. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any closing agreement or offer
in compromise with any taxing authority.



(j) No claim has been made in writing by an authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to Taxes in that
jurisdiction. There is no outstanding ruling request, request to consent to
change a method of accounting, subpoena or written request for information,
with or by any taxing authority with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their income, assets or business, or any Tax.



 

26 (k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any ruling
issued by any taxing authority or any binding agreement with any taxing
authority, that would materially impact its liability for Taxes after the
Effective Time.



(l) The Company is not and has not been a "reporting corporation" subject to
the information reporting and record maintenance requirements of Section
6038A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have disclosed on their federal income Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that (i) constitute a reportable tax
shelter transaction or any other tax shelter transaction within the meaning of
Section 6011 of the Code or (ii) could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code. 



(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any taxable
income or gain as result of prior intercompany transactions that have been
deferred and that will be taxed as a result of the changes in ownership
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any excess loss accounts (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19).

Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in material compliance with
all Environmental Laws (as defined below); (ii) there has been no release or

material, substance or waste, or petroleum or any fraction thereof (each a
"Hazardous Substance") on, upon, into or from any site currently or

which could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) there have been no Hazardous Substances
generated by the Company or its Subsidiaries that have been disposed of or
come to rest at any site that has been included in any published U.S. federal,
state or local "superfund" site list or any other similar list of hazardous
or toxic waste sites published by any Governmental Entity within or outside
the United States which could reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iv) there are no underground
storage tanks located on, no polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") or PCB-
containing equipment used or stored on, and no hazardous waste as defined by
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, stored on, any site
owned or operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries, except for the storage
of hazardous waste in compliance with Environmental Laws; and (v) the Company
and its Subsidiaries have furnished to Parent true and correct copies of all
material environmental records, reports, notifications, certificates of need,
permits, pending permit applications, correspondence, engineering studies, and
environmental studies or assessments relating to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties and assets.



(b) For purposes of this Section 3.17, "Environmental Laws" means any law,
regulation, or other applicable requirement (whether domestic or foreign)
relating to (i) releases or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance;
(ii) pollution or protection of employee health or safety, public health or
the environment; or (iii) the manufacture, handling, transport, use,

27 SECTION 3.18 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and
correct list of all U.S. and foreign (i) patents and pending patent
applications owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement; (ii) trademark registrations and pending trademark
applications owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
of this Agreement; (iii) copyright registrations and pending copyright
applications owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement, and (iv) internet domain name registrations owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively the "Registered Intellectual
Property"). All of the Registered Intellectual Property is owned solely by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries.



(b) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns, or has a valid right
to use all of the Intellectual Property (as defined below) that is used in the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.



(c) The Registered Intellectual Property used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is, to the Companys knowledge, subsisting, in full force and
effect (except with respect to applications), and has not expired or been
cancelled, or abandoned.



(d) Except as listed on Section 3.18(d) of the Disclosure Schedule, there is
no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened (and at no time within
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement has there been pending any)
material suit, arbitration or other adversarial proceeding before any court,
government agency or arbitral tribunal or in any jurisdiction alleging that
the activities or the conduct of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
business infringes or will infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of any third party or
challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability or registerability of any
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company is not party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents,
decrees, stipulations, judgments, or orders resulting from suits, actions or
similar legal proceedings which (i) materially restrict the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries rights to use any Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) materially restrict the conduct of
the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order to avoid
infringement or other violation of any third partys intellectual property
rights, or (iii) permit third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(e) The conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted does not infringe upon any intellectual property rights
owned by any third party. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken
reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of the Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or such Subsidiary that is material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. To the
Companys knowledge, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting
or violating any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently



 

28 conducted, and no suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings for
misappropriation, infringement dilution or violation of Intellectual Property
have been brought before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal
against any third party by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which remain
unresolved.



(f) The Company and each of its operating Subsidiaries enforce a policy of
requiring each relevant employee to execute a confidentiality and assignment
of proprietary rights agreement substantially in the Companys standard form
as set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the Disclosure Schedule and there has been
no disclosure to any third party by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
material confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries related to any material proprietary product currently
being marketed, sold, licensed or developed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each such product, a "Proprietary Product") other than
disclosures made pursuant to nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business. All employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have made
material contributions to the development of any Proprietary Product
(including all employees who have designed, written, tested or worked on any
software code contained in any Proprietary Product) have signed
confidentiality and assignment of proprietary rights agreements substantially
in one of the forms attached to Section 3.18(f) of the Disclosure
Schedule. All consultants and independent contractors who have made material
contributions to the development of any Proprietary Product (including all
consultants and independent contractors who have designed, written, tested or
worked on any software code contained in any Proprietary Product) have
assigned to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (or a third party
that previously conducted any business currently conducted by the Company or
one or more of its Subsidiaries and that has assigned its rights in such
Proprietary Product to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries) all of
their right, title and interest (other than moral rights, if any) in and to
the portions of such Proprietary Product developed by them in the course of
their work for the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries, which
assignments are enforceable by the Company and effective for the protection of
the Companys rights to Intellectual Property under all of the laws applicable
to the contracts between the Company and such consultants and independent
contractors. Assignments of the patents and patent applications listed in
Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the Company or one or more of
its Subsidiaries have been duly executed and filed with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office.



(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted or is
obligated to grant access to any of its source code, object code or any open
license or has licensed or has the right to obtain any source code, object
code or any open license of any third party (including in any such case any
conditional right to access or under which the Company has established any
escrow arrangement for the storage and conditional release of any source code,
object code or open license). No event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or
could reasonably be expected to, result in the delivery, license, or
disclosure of the source code for any software of the Company or its
subsidiaries to any third party.



 

29 (h) Except as disclosed in Section 3.18(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Propriety Products contains any software code that is, in whole or in
part, subject to the provisions of any open source or quasi-open source
license agreement, including but not limited to open source or quasi-open
source license agreements that (i) obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make the source code for such Proprietary Product generally
available to the public or (ii) otherwise imposes any limitation, restriction,
or condition on the right or ability of the Company or its subsidiaries to
use or distribute any Proprietary Product of the Company or its Subsidiaries.



(i) Except as specified in the IP Licenses set forth on Section 3.18(j) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have any obligation to pay any
third party any royalties, honoraria or other fees for the use of Intellectual
Property.



(j) All IP Licenses are valid and binding obligations of the Company or a
Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge of the Company, all other parties thereto,
and are enforceable in accordance with their terms. "IP Licenses" means all
licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or permissions, including the right
to receive, or the obligation to pay, royalties or any other consideration,
related to Intellectual Property to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party other than shrink-wrapped software that is generally
available in the commercial markets such as word processing programs under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a licensor or licensee as of
the date of this Agreement. Section 3.18(j) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth all IP Licenses under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
licensee as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.18(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, there exists no event or condition which
would reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice of lapse of time or both) a
material default by the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party under any such IP License. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has licensed or sublicensed its rights in any
material Intellectual Property other than pursuant to the IP Licenses. The
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
(i) result in any loss or impairment of ownership by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of, or the right of any of them to use, any Intellectual
Property that is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as currently conducted, (ii) obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to pay royalties or other fees with regard to any Intellectual Property, or
(iii) require the consent of any Governmental Entity or third party with
respect to any such Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement under which a third party would be
entitled to receive a license or any other right to any intellectual property
of Parent or any of Parents affiliates as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(k) No software of the Company or its Subsidiaries contains any "back door,"
"drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as such
terms are commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code
designed or intended to have, or capable of performing, any of the following
functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise impeding in any
manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer

directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and it

39 solicit, initiate, resume, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or proposals
that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition

of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, following the advice of
outside counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, the
Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
6.2(b)) which was not solicited by it and which did not otherwise result from
a breach of this Section 6.2(a), and subject to providing prior written notice
of its decision to take such action to Parent (a "Section 6.2 Notice") and
compliance with Section 6.2(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the

Merger (any such withdrawal, amendment, modification or proposal, a "Change
of Recommendation");



(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in

with the provisions of Section 6.2(a)); or



(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

breach by the Company of this Section 6.2, effect a Change of Recommendation,
and in the case of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made
directly to the stockholders of the Company, may recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the tender or exchange offer, if (A) the
Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be
a Superior Proposal; (B) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith, following the advice of outside counsel, that its fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under applicable law require it to do so, but

Stockholders Meeting and is after the fifth business day following Parents
receipt of the written notice specified in the following clause, (C) the
Company has (i) provided to Parent five business days prior written notice
which shall state expressly (x) that it has received a Superior Proposal, (y)

Board of Directors desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation due to
the existence of a Superior Proposal, (ii) provided to Parent a copy of all
written materials delivered to the Person or group making the Superior
Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal to the extent that such
materials have not previously been provided to Parent, (iii) made available to

making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal, and

negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Acquisition
Proposal which was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a
Superior Proposal; or (D) the Company shall have complied with this Section
6.2 and shall not have breached in any material respect of any of the
provisions set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5. Nothing in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take any action described in
clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.2(b), or (B)
affect any obligation of the Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the
Companys obligation under this Agreement to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, regardless of whether the Companys
Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation.



If Parent makes a counterproposal to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf
in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide,
written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment after receiving the advice of an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this



 

41 Agreement) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger,
to have a reasonable likelihood of closing, and for which financing, to the
extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being, and likely
to be, obtained on the proposed terms by such third party.



(c) The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall, and
it shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents) to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify
Parent immediately after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity
that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in
writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror
and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis (and in any event within
24 hours) of all developments and the status of any Acquisition Proposal, any
negotiations or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person or entity that is considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all
documents received from or delivered or sent to any person or entity that is
considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal to the extent that
such documents relate to or are furnished in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal and have not previously been provided to Parent. The Company will
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company
provided to any other party making an Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to Parent.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking any action or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, following the advice of outside counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.2, neither
the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw or modify, or propose to any person outside the Company to withdraw
or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or
approve or recommend, or propose to any person outside the Company to approve
or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.



SECTION 6.3 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of execution of this Agreement, prepare and
file with the SEC the



 

42 Proxy Statement in preliminary form (provided that Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement, and each amendment or supplement thereto, prior to its
filing with the SEC), and the Company shall use its best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto. If at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company there shall occur any
event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC. Subject to
the right of the Companys Board of Directors to withdraw or modify its
recommendation pursuant to Section 6.2(b), (i) the Proxy Statement shall
include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor
of the Merger and (ii) if requested to do so by Parent at any time prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting and subject to compliance with applicable
laws, if there shall have been publicly announced an alternative Acquisition
Proposal, the Companys Board of Directors shall, within a reasonable period
of time following such request (and prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting), publicly reaffirm such recommendation and/or shall publicly announce
that it is not recommending that the stockholders of the Company accept an
alternative Acquisition Proposal, provided that such reaffirmation or
announcement does not require significant delay in the timing of the Company
Stockholders Meeting. 



SECTION 6.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 



(a) The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all
actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq to promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 6.2(b), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the Companys Board of
Directors shall recommend adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, and (ii) neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Companys
Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Unless such
recommendation shall have been modified or withdrawn in accordance with
Section 6.2(b), the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and
lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company that are required by the rules of Nasdaq or the
GCL. Provided that the Company has acted and continues to act in accordance
with the first sentence of this Section 6.4, the Company may, after written
notice to, and consultation with, Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
stockholders, or (ii) if as of the time of which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting.



 

43 (b) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4 and shall submit the
proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger to its
stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such proposal whether or not (i)
the Companys Board of Directors at any time subsequent to the date of this
Agreement determines, in the manner permitted by Section 6.2(b), that the
proposal is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the
Company reject such proposal, or (ii) any actual, potential or purported
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has been commenced, disclosed,
announced or submitted to the Company. The Company shall ensure that all
proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the GCL, the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq and all other applicable legal
requirements.



(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate of its Corporate Secretary setting forth the voting results from
the Company Stockholders Meeting.



SECTION 6.5  _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and, subject to
Section 6.2, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed with respect to the
Merger (which efforts shall include furnishing all information required under
the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with any other
Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information
to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon any of
them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the
taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall
be required to (i) sell or dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or
otherwise) any assets or businesses or interests in any assets or businesses
of Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates or make any other change
in any portion of the Companys or its business or incur any other limitation
on the conduct of the Companys or its business to obtain such consents,
authorizations, orders, approvals and exemptions or agree to do, or submit to
orders providing for, any of the foregoing, in each case whether before or
after the Effective Time, (ii) utilize its reasonable best efforts in
responding to formal requests for additional information or documentary
material pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.20 under the HSR Act, or any other
Antitrust Law (as defined below) for a period of time exceeding thirty days
from the receipt of any such initial request, or (iii) take any action under
this Section 6.5 if any governmental body that has the authority to enforce
any Antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to seek, a preliminary
injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger.



 

44 SECTION 6.6 _Public Announcements_.



(a) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or making any public statement with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ _,_
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such
press release or make such public statement as may upon the written advice of
counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or Nasdaq
if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party prior
thereto.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties (and each employee, representative
or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant
to the tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby beginning on
the earliest of (i) the date of the public announcement by the parties of
discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the date of
public announcement by the parties of the transactions contemplated hereby or
(iii) the date of the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall permit either party (or any
employee, representative or agent thereof) to disclose (A) any information
that is not necessary to understand the tax treatment and tax structure of
such transactions (including the identity of the parties and any information
that could lead another to determine the identity of the parties), or (B) any
other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a
violation of any applicable law.



SECTION 6.7  _Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee
benefit plans of Parent or its affiliates in which Company Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From
and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be
inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company) under any group
health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee
credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to
the Effective Time for which evidence of payment is provided to Parent.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect as
of the Effective Time such actions relating to the Companys 401(k) Plan (the
"401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including
terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to



 

45 the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable law
and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation
of the Company Employees in any successor plan or the rollover of the account
balances of Company Employees (including loan balances) to Parents 401(k)
plan.



(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event within thirty days thereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the outstanding Company Stock Options assumed under
Section 6.8(a) for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available. The
Company shall cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such
registration statement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain such Form S-8 registration statement in effect until all the Company
Stock Options are either exercised or expire.



SECTION 6.8 _Stock Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be adjusted in accordance with its terms into, and deemed
to constitute, an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(including as to vesting and exercisability) as were applicable under the
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (ii) the Conversion Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share equal to (i) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option times
(ii) the Conversion Ratio (with the result rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). "Conversion Ratio" shall mean the fraction having a numerator equal to
the closing price of Parents common stock on the Closing Date, as quoted on
the NYSE, and having a denominator equal to the Share Price; _provided,
however,_ that if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted. It is the intention of the parties that the Company Stock Options
which qualify as incentive stock options (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the
Effective Time.



(b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of any Company
Stock Plan or any Company Stock Option, the Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options
and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to
give effect to the provisions of Section 6.8(a).



SECTION 6.9  _Consents_. The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the
Companys material agreements,



 

46 contracts, licenses or leases in connection with the Merger, including each of
the consents listed or required to be listed in Section 6.9 of the Disclosure
Schedule or required to prevent the occurrence of an event that could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect prior to the Effective Time or after the Effective
Time.



SECTION 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of litigation expenses and
limitation of personal liability existing in favor of the directors, officers
and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the provisions
existing on the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws shall, with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), survive the Effective Time, and, as of the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all obligations of the Company in
respect thereof as to any claim or claims asserted prior to or within a six-
year period immediately after the Effective Time.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to former officers and directors
of the Company) only with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.10(b) more than an aggregate amount equal to 150% of current
aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be
$197,000 in the aggregate). If the amount of the aggregate annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, the Surviving Corporation during such three-year period shall maintain
or procure as much coverage as possible for aggregate annual premiums not to
exceed the Maximum Amount.



SECTION 6.11 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement (including without limitation Section 6.5),
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, upon any director or officer of Parent or the Company (as applicable)
becoming aware of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.12 will not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the
Merger.



 

47 SECTION 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by
the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 203 of the GCL be
withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the Company. If
any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the
Companys Board of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and take such
lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.



SECTION 6.14 _Section 16 Matters_.



(a) The Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective
Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of options to
purchase Parent Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of Company Stock
Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to
the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information,
is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Board of Directors of the Company, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by the Company Insiders of
their Company Stock Options which will be deemed to occur upon the assumption
of those options and their resulting conversion into options to purchase
Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 16 Information" means the
identification of the Company Insiders and (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be beneficially
owned by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, together
with the applicable exercise price per share, subject to each Company Stock
Option held by the Company Insider which is to be assumed and converted into
options to purchase Parent Common Stock, in each case, in connection with the
Merger, which shall be provided by the Company to Parent not less than 30
business days prior to the Effective Time.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers
and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as listed in the Section 16 Information.

prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding approval thereof by the
stockholders of the Company:



(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company;



(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by February 28, 2006 (the "Outside Date") provided, that if (x)
the Effective Time has not occurred by such date by reason of the non-
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c)
and (y) all other conditions set forth in Article VII have heretofore been
satisfied or waived or are then capable of being satisfied, then such date

"Outside Date"), (provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
willful failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has
been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur
on or before the Outside Date);

governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have
issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise

ruling or other action vacated or lifted);



(d) by either Parent or, if the Company has not willfully and materially

this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause the conditions

breach shall not have been cured within 10 business days following receipt by
Parent of written notice of such breach from the Company;



(g) by Parent, if

Directors (or any committee thereof) do so;



(iii) the Companys Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall have
approved or recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Merger);



(iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common

recommends that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such
tender or exchange offer or, within ten (10) business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, fails to recommend against
acceptance of such offer; or



 

52 (v) for any reason the Company shall have failed to hold the Company

hereof shall survive termination and (ii) following the termination of this
Agreement, nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful and material breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein.



SECTION 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ _, _ that Parent and the Company shall
share equally all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the filings by
Parent and the Company under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any
similar filing requirement of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Merger or this Agreement.



(b) The Company shall reimburse Parent for all fees and expenses of Parent
actually incurred relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including fees and expenses of Parents counsel, accountants and
financial advisors) up to a maximum amount of $3,000,000 upon the termination
of this Agreement (i) by Parent pursuant to Sections 8.1(e)(ii), if the
Companys breach or failure to perform was material to this determination,
8.1(g), unless the failure to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of clause (v) thereof was due to the actions of a Governmental Entity
or a willful and material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
preventing the Company from holding the Company Stockholders Meeting, or
8.1(h), or (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) or 7.2(c) (but
only, in the case of Section 7.2(c), if the Company terminates the employment
agreement without cause or causes a constructive termination under applicable
employment law) by the Outside Date shall have resulted in the Closing not
occurring.



(c) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $11,585,000 upon the
earliest to occur of the following events (each, a "Termination Event"):



(i) the entry by the Company into an agreement with respect to, or the
consummation of, any Acquisition Proposal or the acquisition by any person of
beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the equity or voting interests of the
Company in any such case within one year of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) (but only if the failure to satisfy the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2(b), 7.2(d) or 7.2(e) by the Outside Date shall have
resulted in the Closing not occurring), 8.1(d) or 8.1(e)(ii), in each case, if
prior to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the right of termination
such Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make such Acquisition Proposal,
provided that an acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of no more
than 50% of the equity or voting interests of the Company for which the sole
purpose is to provide additional equity capital to the Company and in which
such person does not acquire the right to elect more than 25% of the members
of the Companys board of directors will not constitute an Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this paragraph (c)(i); or



 

53 (ii) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Sections 8.1(g)
(unless the failure to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of clause (v) thereof was due to the actions of a Governmental Entity or a
willful and material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
preventing the Company from holding the Company Stockholders Meeting) or
8.1(h).



(d) The expenses and fees, if applicable, payable pursuant to Sections 8.3(b)
and 8.3(c) shall be paid promptly, but in no event later than the date of the
first to occur of the events described in Sections 8.3(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) or
8.3(c)(i) or (ii). The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Section 8.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.3(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in Section 8.3(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) actually incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

SECTION 9.8 _Assignment_. __This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation

deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."



SECTION 9.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_ _._ No

any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive

construed in accordance with, the internal laws of The Commonwealth of

Commonwealth of Massachusetts.



SECTION 9.12 _Counterparts_. __ This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



SECTION 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or in Massachusetts state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.
