Partner has caused Oiltanking MLP to purchase a "tail policy" to cover claims
during a period of six years from and after the Closing Date with respect to

prior to the Closing, and Enterprise, after the Closing, agree to cause the
General Partner, to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If any Proceeding by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice or an Attorney General of any U.S. State (if such
Attorney General is conducting an antitrust review) (collectively, an
"Antitrust Authority") is commenced that questions either the validity
or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or the ownership, control
or use of the assets by Enterprise or any Affiliate of the Oiltanking MLP
Entities following the Closing under the Competition Laws, the Contributing
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Enterprise to (i) defend against such Proceeding, and (ii) in the event an
Order is issued in any such Proceeding, to have such Order lifted. In
furtherance of the foregoing, unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable Laws
or by an Antitrust Authority, the Contributing Parties shall provide notice,
as soon as reasonably practicable, to Enterprise or its outside antitrust
counsel (including on an outside counsel only basis) of any request for
information by an Antitrust Authority and provide advance notice of each
response to any such request. The Contributing Parties shall provide
Enterprise or its outside antitrust counsel with an opportunity to review any
response to an Antitrust Authority, unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable
Laws or by an Antitrust Authority. With respect to the foregoing, the
Contributing Parties shall consider in good faith the views of Enterprise.
Enterprise shall take the lead in determining strategy for conducting any
meetings, discussions, appearances and contacts or defending any allegations
that the transactions contemplated hereby violate the Competition Laws.
Further, Enterprise shall take the lead in resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any Governmental Authority, or obtaining any necessary
approvals regarding the ownership and use of any assets of Enterprise or the
Oiltanking Entities following the Closing. The Contributing Parties shall
not, without the prior consent of Enterprise, make any offer or compromise or
otherwise offer or seek to settle any allegation transactions contemplated
hereby violate the Competition Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, each of the parties covenants and agrees that it shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, and shall not cause
any Person to, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with other Persons,
pursue, or assist any other Person to initiate or pursue, any Proceedings
against any party hereto, any person affiliated with any party hereto or any
Representative of the foregoing for breach of this Agreement on the grounds
that the execution and performance of, or the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents violate any Competition
Laws (other than any indemnity claim pursuant to ARTICLE 6 hereof for any
breach of any of the representations set forth in _Section 3.03_,  _3.10(b)_
and _4.03_ ).

Section 5.06. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
for any press releases and public announcements, the making of which may be
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation.

 



39 Section 5.07. _M andB Marks_.

 

(a) Enterprise agrees that after the Closing neither Enterprise nor its
Affiliates (including the Oiltanking Entities) shall have any rights in and
to the names "Oiltanking," "Marquard and Bahls," "MandB" or any trademarks, trade
names, service marks, trade dress, logos, corporate names, domain names and
other source identifiers, emblems, signs or insignia containing or comprising
the foregoing, including any mark confusingly similar thereto or derivative
thereof (collectively, the "MandB Marks"), and shall not at any time after the
Closing market, promote, advertise or offer for sale any products, goods or
services utilizing any of the MandB Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having
any affiliation with MandB or any of its Affiliates. If any of the assets of the
Oiltanking Entities, including any promotional materials or printed forms,
bear MandB marks, Enterprise and its Affiliates (including the Oiltanking
Entities) shall, prior to distributing, selling or otherwise making use of
such assets for the general public, remove, delete, cover or render illegible
the MandB marks as they may appear on such assets. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on
the earlier of (i) the nine-month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) 90
days after the consummation of any merger or any other transaction in which
Oiltanking MLP becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Enterprise (such applicable date, the "MandB Marks Termination Date"),
Enterprise and its Affiliates (including the Oiltanking Entities) may use any
remaining inventory of materials, including business cards, stationery,
packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials and other
similar materials that include one or more of the MandB Marks to the extent
such materials were included in the assets as of the Closing. Enterprise shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Contributing Parties and their Affiliates
against all Damages incurred as a consequence of the use of the MandB Marks by
Enterprise and its Affiliates (including the Oiltanking Entities), and cause
the Oiltanking Entities to indemnify and hold harmless the Contributing
Parties and their Affiliates against all Damages incurred with respect to
their use).

(b) Prior to the MandB Marks Termination Date, Enterprise shall cause the
Oiltanking Entities to make the initial filing required to be made with the
applicable Governmental Authority to cause each of the Oiltanking Entities
whose name includes the name "Oiltanking" to change its name such that its
name does not include the name "Oiltanking" and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to change any such name as promptly as practicable
thereafter.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the MandB Marks Termination Date,
Enterprise shall cause the Oiltanking Entities to assign or transfer to
Affiliates of MandB designated by the Contributing Parties all right, title or
interest in any Oiltanking Intellectual Property Rights containing or
comprising MandB Marks.

 



40 Section 5.08. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each party shall promptly notify
the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(c) any Proceedings commenced or threatened in writing that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or materially impair the notifying partys ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

Section 5.09. _Taxes_.

 

(a) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and
any similar Tax) shall be borne 50% by Enterprise and 50% by the Contributing
Parties. Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes
shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or
customarily responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax
Returns, and such party will use reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax
Returns to the other party at least ten days prior to the due date, including
extensions, for such Tax Returns. Upon the filing of Tax Returns in
connection with Transfer Taxes, the filing party shall provide the other party
with evidence satisfactory to the other party that such Transfer Taxes have
been filed and paid.

 

(b) The Parties agree that the portion of Oiltanking MLPs income allocable to
the Subject Interests will be reflected on the federal income Tax Return for
OTA and OTB Holdco for the period up to and including the Closing Date, and
shall be reflected on the federal income Tax Return of Enterprise for the
period after the Closing Date, by closing the books of Oiltanking MLP as of
the end of the Closing Date.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate fully, and cause their Affiliates to
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, to accomplish the apportionment of income described pursuant to this
_Section 5.09_ and to promptly respond to requests for the provision of any
information or documentation within the knowledge or possession of the other
Party as reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with financial
reporting obligations arising under FASB Statement No. 109 (including
compliance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48),
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each, a "Tax Proceeding") with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include access to, the retention and
(upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties
each agree, upon request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



41 (d) The Contributing Parties shall be liable for, shall pay and shall
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Enterprise and its Subsidiaries
from and against all Damages such parties incur arising from (i) any breach of
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.21_ as they relate
to Taxes of the General Partner (as if made as of the Closing Date and
determined without regard to any Oiltanking Material Adverse Effect,
materiality or similar qualifier), (ii) any Taxes of or with respect to the
Subject Interests attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) any liability of the General
Partner for the Tax of another Person as a result of being (A) a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group prior to the Closing Date
or (B) a party to any Tax Sharing Agreement or another contract entered into
prior to the Closing Date providing for an obligation to indemnify any other
Person for Tax (other than any customary indemnity under credit agreements or
other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that do not
relate primarily to Taxes), and (iv) any Transfer Taxes that the Contributing
Parties are obligated to pay as set forth in _Section 5.09(a)_. Enterprise
shall be liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Contributing Parties from and against all Damages such parties
incur arising from (i) any Taxes of or with respect to the Subject
Interests attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning
after the Closing Date and (ii) any Transfer Taxes that Enterprise is
obligated to pay as set forth in _Section 5.09(a)_.

 

(e) If any claim (an "Indemnified Tax Claim") is made by any Taxing Authority
that, if successful, would result in indemnification of any Party (the "Tax
Indemnified Party") by another Party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") under this
_Section 5.09(e)_, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event later than the earlier of (i) 45 days after receipt of notice from the
Taxing Authority of such claim or (ii) 15 days prior to the date required for
the filing of any protest of such claim, notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in
writing of such fact. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall control all decisions
with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim and the
Tax Indemnified Party shall take such action (including settlement with
respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax Proceeding to a
determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or appellate
jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax
Claim as the Tax Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request in writing from
time to time, including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution
of powers of attorney; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) within 30 days after
the notice required by this _Section 5.09(g)_ has been delivered (or such
earlier date that any payment of Taxes with respect to such claim is due but
in no event sooner than five days after the Tax Indemnifying Partys receipt
of such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be
contested, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax
Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the Tax Indemnified Party, on an
interest-free basis, the amount of such claim. The Tax Indemnified Party
shall not make any payment of an Indemnified Tax Claim for at least 30 days
(or such shorter period as may be required by Law) after the giving of the
notice required by this  _Section 5.09(g)_ with respect to such claim, shall
give to the Tax Indemnifying Party any information requested related to such
claim, and otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in order
to contest effectively any such claim.

 



42 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent any
other provision of this Agreement conflicts with this _Section 5.09_ with
respect to any claims relating to Taxes (including any claims relating to
representations respecting Tax matters including _Section 3.23_ and 
_Section 4.16_), this _Section 5.09_ shall govern. No claim may be made or
brought by any Party hereto after the expiration of the applicable survival
period unless such claim has been asserted by written notice specifying
the details supporting the claim on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period. The rights under this _Section 5.09_ shall
survive the Closing until 30 days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions) applicable to such Tax matter; _provided_
, _however_ , that any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
5.09(g)_ shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant
to the preceding sentences, if proper notice of such right of indemnity shall
have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior
to such time.

 

(g) The Parties intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the
contribution of the Subject Interests in exchange for the Consideration shall
be treated by the Contributing Parties and Enterprise as (i) a contribution by
OTA and OTB Holdco of a portion of the Subject Interests in exchange for the
Unit Consideration and, to the maximum extent possible, a reimbursement of
certain capital expenditures made by OTA with respect to the Subject Interests
satisfying the requirements of Treas. Reg. Section 1.707-4(d) (any such
expenditures, "Preformation Capital Expenditures"), in a transaction
consistent with the requirements of Section 721 of the Code and (ii) a sale of
a portion of the Subject Interests in exchange for the Cash Consideration
(other than Cash Consideration equal to the amount of any
Preformation Capital Expenditures). The Parties shall not take any position
for income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with such treatment, except to
the extent that such Party is bound by a final determination that is
consistent with such position.

 

Section 5.10. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) All matters related to the terms of employment to be offered to Business
Employees by Enterprise or an Affiliate of Enterprise shall be governed
solely by the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement, none of
Enterprise, any Affiliate of Enterprise, the General Partner or any Oiltanking
MLP Entity shall have or assume (i) any OTA Employee Liability, (ii) any
liability or obligation to any Business Employee or (iii) any liability or
obligation with respect to any OTA Benefit Plan.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except as set forth in _Section 5.04_, (i) no Business Employee shall have
any contractual rights (as a third party or otherwise) under the Employee
Matters Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing in the
Employee Matters Agreement or any provision of this Agreement shall be treated
as an amendment of, or undertaking or obligation to amend, establish or adopt,
any Benefit Plan of Enterprise or any Affiliate of Enterprise with respect to
any Business Employee who becomes an employee of Enterprise or an Affiliate of
Enterprise as provided in the Employee Matters Agreement.

 



43 Section 5.11. _Board Representation_.

 

(a) Effective as of Closing, the Enterprise General Partner shall appoint Dr.
Christian Flach (the "MandB Designee") as member to the Enterprise Board. MandB
shall be entitled to maintain the MandB Designee as a member of the Enterprise
Board as long as MandB and its Affiliates beneficially own at least 27,403,676
Enterprise Common Units issued by Enterprise to MandB and its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement or the Liquidity Option Agreement. In the event
that the MandB Designee becomes unable or unwilling to, or for another reason
ceases to, serve as a member of the Enterprise Board while MandB is entitled to
maintain the MandB Designee, MandB may designate another person reasonably
acceptable to the Enterprise Board as replacement of the MandB Designee, and
Enterprise General Partner shall appoint, or cause its members to appoint,
such person as a member to the Enterprise Board. The MandB Designee shall not be
entitled to compensation as a director of the Enterprise General Partner, but
the MandB Designee shall be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable travel
expenses in connection with attending meetings of the Enterprise Board.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the exercise of the "Liquidity Option"
under the Liquidity Option Agreement shall not affect MandBs rights under this
Section 5.11 if MandB and its Affiliates continue to beneficially own at least
27,403,676 Enterprise Common Units issued by Enterprise to MandB and its
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the Liquidity Option Agreement
following such exercise; and (ii) OTAs Enterprise Common Units shall not
cease to be "Registrable Securities" under the Registration Rights Agreement
in the event MandB designates another person to replace the MandB Designee.

 

(c) MandB shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.11 and shall have
the right to enforce its rights hereunder.

Section 5.12. _Ancillary Assets_.

 

(a) In connection with the continuation of services to be provided pursuant to
the Employee Matters Agreement, each of the Contributing Parties agrees that
it will assign and transfer, or cause OTNA or its other affiliates to assign
and transfer, to Oiltanking or another entity specified by Enterprise, any and
all company vehicles, laptops, desktops, printers, mobile devices and other
office assets (the "Devices") (to the extent owned by the Contributing
Parties, OTNA or other affiliates controlled by the Contributing Parties) that
are used primarily by any Eligible Employee in rendering the continuation
services who becomes an employee of EPCO in accordance with the Employee
Matters Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Devices shall not include
material office infrastructure such as networking devices and other
equipment that are used by Eligible Employees or other employees of OTNA and
its affiliates for shared services.

(b) In addition, each of the Contributing Parties agree that it will assign
and transfer to Oiltanking or another entity specified by Enterprise any other
assets owned by the Contributing Parties that (i) are located on the principal
terminal properties of the Oiltanking Entities and used in the business of
the Oiltanking Entities or (ii) are primarily used in, or necessary for, the
conduct of the business of the Oiltanking Entities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that 

 



44  assets in clause (ii) that are primarily used in, but are not necessary for,
the conduct of the business of the Oiltanking Entities shall not include
material infrastructure that is used by Eligible Employees or other employees
of OTNA and its affiliates for shared services.

Statements), and _3.12_ (No Undisclosed Material Liabilities) (solely with

shall terminate on the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date. The
representations and warranties of Enterprise contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection

_provided_ , _further_ , that the representations and warranties contained in

terminate on the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date. All
covenants and other agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement
that, by their terms, are to be performed after the Closing, shall survive
the Closing indefinitely or for such shorter period as explicitly specified
therein. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which
it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 6.01_, if notice of
the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall
have been duly given, in accordance with the procedures and requirements set
forth in this ARTICLE 6, to the party against whom such indemnity may be
sought prior to such time.

 

Section 6.02. _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this ARTICLE 6, each Contributing
Party hereby indemnifies Enterprise and its Affiliates against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from any and all damage, loss, fine, settlement
payments, awards, judgments, penalties and expense (including 

 



45  reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in connection with any Proceeding whether involving a third party
claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto) ("Damages") actually
incurred or suffered by Enterprise or any of its Affiliates arising out of (i)
any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any of the Oiltanking

breach of covenant or other agreement made or to be performed by each
Contributing Party pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this ARTICLE 6, Enterprise hereby indemnifies each Contributing Party and its
Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
Damages actually incurred or suffered by any Contributing Party or any of its
Affiliates arising out of (i) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of
any of the Enterprise Fundamental Representations or Enterprise Special
Representations, or (ii) any breach of covenant or other agreement made or to
be performed by Enterprise pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 6.03. _Third Party Claim Procedures_ _._ (a) The Person seeking
indemnification under _Section 6.02_ (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to
give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any Proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the specifics of such Third Party Claim, the
basis for indemnification and the Indemnified Partys bona fide estimate of
the amount of such Third Party Claim (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have actually adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 6.03_, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for
such defense, in each case at its own expense; _provided_ , however, that the
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized, prior to the Indemnifying Partys
delivery of a written election to the Indemnified Party of its agreement to
defend such Third-Party Claim, to file any motion, answer or other pleading
that it shall reasonably deem necessary to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, it shall within 30 days after receipt of the notice referred to
in _Section 6.03(a)_ notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to
do so. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume control of such
defense of the Third Party Claim only for so long as it conducts such defense
with reasonable diligence. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified
Party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof
on a reasonably current basis and shall consider in good faith the
recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 6.03_, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement or compromise of such 

 



46  Third Party Claim if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.
The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party.

(d) The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim, or take any corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed
judgment or consent decree with respect thereto, that subjects the Indemnified
Party to any criminal liability, requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing
on the part of the Indemnified Party or imposes any continuing obligation on
or requires any payment from the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(e) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their
respective controlled Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 6.04. _Direct Claim Procedures_ _._ In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under _Section 6.02_ against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to
give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the specifics of such claim, the
basis for indemnification and the Indemnified Partys bona fide estimate of
the amount of such claim (taking into account the information then available
to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent such failure shall have actually adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity
obligation for any Damages with respect to such claim, the parties shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation
in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 7.06.

Section 6.05.  _Limitation of Damages_.

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under _Section 6.02(a)(i)_ in respect of Oiltanking Special
Representations or under _Section 6.02(b)(i)_ in respect of Enterprise
Special Representations, as applicable, until the aggregate amount of all
Damages in respect of indemnification for Oiltanking Special Representations
or Enterprise Special Representations, as applicable, exceeds an amount equal
to 1% of the Consideration (the "Deductible"), in which event the Indemnifying
Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for Damages in excess of the
Deductible. With respect to any indemnification claim under _Section
6.02(a)(i)_ in respect of Oiltanking Special Representations or under _Section
6.02(b)(i)_ in respect of Enterprise Special Representations, as applicable,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any individual or series of
related Damages which do not exceed $50,000 (which Damages shall not be
counted toward the Deductible).

 

(b) The aggregate amount of all Damages for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to  _Section 6.02(a)(i)_ in respect of Oiltanking Special
Representations or under _Section 6.02(b)(i)_ in respect of Enterprise
Special Representations, as applicable, shall not exceed an amount equal to
10% of the Consideration. 

 



47 Section 6.06. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under _Section 6.02_ by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies,
or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent
to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of any reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under  _Section 6.02_ for any
punitive, special, indirect, consequential, remote or speculative Damages of
any kind or nature or (ii) Damages for lost profits, except with respect to
Damages for lost profits, to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction
determined that lost profits is the appropriate measure of direct damages with
respect to the matters giving rise to the claim for Damages; _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall prevent an Indemnified Party from recovering all
components of awards against them in Third Party Claims for which recovery is
provided in this _ARTICLE 6_.

 

(c) Each Indemnified Party must take commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any Damages for which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such
Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the Indemnifying Party has paid
the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in
respect of that Damage, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying
Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit
to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys
reasonable costs of mitigation) promptly after the benefit is received.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
recovery and collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from
any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under
_Section 6.02_. To the extent recovery and collection is obtained, the amount
of any Damages with respect to such indemnification claim will be reduced
accordingly.

Section 6.07. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to

have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a Third Party (a "Potential
Contributor") based on the underlying claim

 



48  asserted against the Indemnifying Party, to the extent permitted under

other rights against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment.

Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to
this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

provided by law.

respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of

 



50  its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each other party hereto. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this _Section 7.04_ shall be null and void.

Section 7.05. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such State.

Section 7.06. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court
in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
Federal court of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any such court or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in _Section 7.01_ shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

 

Section 7.07. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY

FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY

Section 7.08. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision
of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,

 



51  benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns other than as expressly provided in  _Section 5.04_ and _Section
5.11_.

Section 7.09. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to grant standing to any person other than the parties hereto.

 

Section 7.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 7.11. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Contributing Parties have set forth
information on the Disclosure Schedules in a Section thereof that corresponds
to the Section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in
one Section of a Schedule need not be set forth in any other Section so long
as its relevance to such other Section of the Schedule or Section of the
Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed
therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Disclosure Schedules may include certain
items and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience
of Enterprise and (b) the disclosure by the Contributing Parties of any matter
in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by the Contributing Parties that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

Section 7.12.  _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions (without the posting of a bond or
other security) to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 7.13. _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto and no former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of
any

 



52  party hereto or any former, current or future equity holder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a "Non-Recourse
Party") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith other than in connection with fraud; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not apply to any liability for obligations
under any of the Transaction Agreements contemplated by this Agreement by any
party to such Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the rights of any party
against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of
its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, or make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, any Non-Recourse Party other than in
connection with fraud.

 



53 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
