only, and not with a view towards any resale or distribution of such Exchange Shares; (c) has been advised and understands that
the Exchange Shares (i) are being issued in reliance upon one or more exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and any applicable state securities Laws, (ii) have not been and shall not be registered under the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities Laws and, therefore, must be held indefinitely and cannot be resold unless such Exchange Shares are registered
under the Securities Act and all applicable state securities Laws, unless exemptions from registration are available and (iii)
are subject to additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement; (d) is aware that an investment in the Purchaser
is a speculative investment and is subject to the risk of complete loss; and (e) acknowledges that the Purchaser is under no obligation
hereunder to register the Exchange Shares under the Securities Act. No Seller has any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer,
or grant participations to such Person, or to any third Person, with respect to the Exchange Shares. By reason of such Seller&rsquo;s
business or financial experience, or by reason of the business or financial experience of such Seller&rsquo;s &ldquo;purchaser
representatives&rdquo; (as that term is defined in Rule 501(h) under the Securities Act), each Seller is capable of evaluating

Seller or such Seller&rsquo;s Representatives pertaining to an investment in the Purchaser and has consulted, as such Seller has
deemed advisable, with its own attorneys, accountants or investment advisors with respect to the investment contemplated hereby
and its suitability for such Seller. Each Seller acknowledges that the Exchange Shares are subject to dilution for events not
under the control of such Seller. Each Seller has completed its independent inquiry and has relied fully upon the advice of its
own legal counsel, accountant, financial and other Representatives in determining the legal, tax, financial and other consequences
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the suitability of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby for such Seller and its particular circumstances, and, except as set forth herein, has not relied upon any representations
or advice by the Purchaser or its Representatives. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that such Seller has not been guaranteed
or represented to by any Person, (i) any specific amount or the event of the distribution of any cash, property or other interest
in the Purchaser or (ii) the profitability or value of the Exchange Shares in any manner whatsoever. Each Seller: (A) has been
represented by independent counsel (or has had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel and has declined to do so);
(B) has had the full right and opportunity to consult with such Seller&rsquo;s attorneys and other advisors and has availed itself
of this right and opportunity; (C) has carefully read and fully understands this Agreement in its entirety and has had it fully
explained to it or him by such counsel; (D) is fully aware of the contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal effect thereof;

this&nbsp;<U>Section 11.4</U>) arising out of, related to, or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (a &ldquo;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&rdquo;) shall be governed by this&nbsp;<U>Section 11.4</U>. A party must, in the first
instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably
detailed description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute
on an amicable basis within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such other parties subject
to such Dispute (the &ldquo;<B><I>Resolution Period</I></B>&rdquo;);&nbsp;<U>provided</U>, that if any Dispute would reasonably
be expected to have become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute,
then there shall be no Resolution Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during the Resolution
Period may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited Procedures of
the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;<B><I>AAA Procedures</I></B>&rdquo;) of the American Arbitration Association (the

(5) Business Days) after the submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute,
which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The
arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after his or her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be streamlined and
efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York. Time is of
the essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after
confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain
from doing, anything consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform its contractual
obligation(s); provided, that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The
arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be in writing and shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrator&rsquo;s reason(s) for
selecting one or the other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New York. The language of the
arbitration shall be English.</FONT></P>
