statements, all in accordance with (i) GAAP methodologies applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved and (ii) Regulation S-X

either case of (a) or (b) by or against the Purchaser or any Purchaser
Subsidiary, its current or former directors, officers or equity holders,

4.13  _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(a)  _Schedule 4.13(a)(i)_ sets forth: (i) all Patents, Trademarks, Internet
Assets and Copyrights owned or licensed by a Target Company or otherwise used
or held for use by a Target Company in which a Target Company is the owner,
applicant or assignee (" _Company Registered IP_ "), specifying as to each
item, as applicable: (A) the nature of the item, including the title, (B) the
owner of the item, (C) the jurisdictions in which the item is issued or
registered or in which an application for issuance or registration has been
filed and (D) the issuance, registration or application numbers and dates; and
(ii) all material unregistered Intellectual Property owned or purported to be
owned by a Target Company. _Schedule 4.13(a)(ii)_ sets forth all licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements or permissions (" _Company IP Licenses_ ")
(other than "shrink wrap," "click wrap," and "off the shelf" software
agreements and other agreements for Software commercially available on
reasonable terms to the public generally with license, maintenance, support
and other fees of less than $5,000 per year (collectively, " _Off-the-Shelf
Software Agreements_ "), which are not required to be listed, although such
licenses are "Company IP Licenses" as that term is used herein), under which a
Target Company is a licensee or otherwise is authorized to use or practice
any Intellectual Property, and describes (A) the applicable Intellectual
Property licensed, sublicensed or used and (B) any royalties, license fees or
other compensation due from a Target Company, if any. Each Target Company
owns, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), has valid and
enforceable rights in, and has the unrestricted right to use, sell, license,
transfer or assign, all Intellectual Property currently used, licensed or
held for use by such Target Company, and previously used or licensed by such
Target Company, except for the Intellectual Property that is the subject of
the Company IP Licenses. For each Patent and Patent application in the Company
Registered IP, the Target Companies have obtained valid assignments of
inventions from each inventor. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.13(a)(iii)_ , all Company Registered IP is owned exclusively by
the applicable Target Company without obligation to pay royalties, licensing
fees or other fees, or otherwise account to any third party with respect to
such Company Registered IP.

  



  

(b) Each Target Company has a valid and enforceable license to use all
Intellectual Property that is the subject of the Company IP Licenses
applicable to such Target Company. The Company IP Licenses include all of the
licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or permissions necessary to
operate the Target Companies as presently conducted. Each Target Company has
performed all obligations imposed on it in the Company IP Licenses, has made
all payments required to date, and such Target Company is not, nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, is any other party thereto, in breach or
default thereunder, nor has any event occurred that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a default thereunder, except that any breach or
default would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The continued use by the Target Companies of the Intellectual
Property that is the subject of the Company IP Licenses in the same manner
that it is currently being used is not restricted by any applicable license
of any Target Company. All registrations for Copyrights, Patents and
Trademarks that are owned by or exclusively licensed to any Target Company
are valid and in force, and all applications to register any Copyrights,
Patents and Trademarks are pending and in good standing, all without
challenge of any kind. No Target Company is party to any Contract that
requires a Target Company to assign to any Person all of its rights in any
Intellectual Property developed by a Target Company under such Contract.

(c)  _Schedule 4.13(c)_ sets forth all licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements or permissions under which a Target Company is the licensor (each,
an " _Outbound IP License_ "), and for each such Outbound IP License,
describes (i) the applicable Intellectual Property licensed, (ii) the
licensee under such Outbound IP License, and (iii) any royalties,
license fees or other compensation due to a Target Company, if any. Each
Target Company has performed all obligations imposed on it in the Outbound IP
Licenses, and such Target Company is not, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is any other party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor has
any event occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a default thereunder, except that any breach or default would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(d) No Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened that
challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or right to use, sell,
license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently licensed, used or
held for use by the Target Companies in any material respect. No Target
Company has received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral
notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use of the
Intellectual Property of any other Person is or may be occurring or has or
may have occurred, as a consequence of the business activities of any Target
Company, nor to the Knowledge of the Company is there a reasonable basis
therefor. There are no Orders to which any Target Company is a party or its
otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of a Target Company to use,
transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of a Target Company
in order to accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property, or (iii)
grant any third Person any right with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by a Target Company. No Target Company is currently infringing, or has,
in the past, infringed, misappropriated or violated any Intellectual Property
of any other Person in any material respect in connection with the ownership,
use or license of any Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by
a Target Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise in connection
with the conduct of the respective businesses of the Target Companies. To the
Company's Knowledge, no third party is infringing upon, has misappropriated
or is otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned, licensed by,
licensed to, or otherwise used or held for use by any Target Company ("
_Company IP_ ") in any material respect.

  



  

(e) All employees and independent contractors of a Target Company have
assigned to the Target Companies all Intellectual Property arising from the
services performed for a Target Company by such Persons. No current or former
officers, employees or independent contractors of a Target Company have
claimed any ownership interest in any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no violation of a
Target Company's policies or practices related to protection of Company IP or
any confidentiality or nondisclosure Contract relating to the Intellectual
Property owned by a Target Company, except for any violation that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has provided the Purchaser with true and complete copies of all
written Contracts referenced in subsections under which employees and
independent contractors assigned their Intellectual Property to a Target
Company.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has obtained unauthorized
access to third party information and data in the possession of a Target
Company, nor has there been any other compromise of the security,
confidentiality or integrity of such information or data. Each Target Company
has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to
privacy, personal data protection, and the collection, processing and use of
personal information and its own privacy policies and guidelines. The
operation of the business of the Target Companies has not and does not
materially violate any right to privacy or publicity of any third person, or
constitute unfair competition or trade practices under applicable Law.

  



  

(g) The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will neither violate nor by their terms result in the material
breach, material modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of, or
acceleration of any payments with respect to, or release of source code
because of (i) any Contract providing for the license or other use of
Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company, or (ii) any Company IP
License. Following the Closing, the Company shall be permitted to exercise,
directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries, all of the Target Companies'
rights under such Contracts or IP Licenses described in the previous sentence
to the same extent that the Target Companies would have been able to exercise
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments which the Target Companies would otherwise be required
to pay in the absence of such transactions.

withheld, or caused to be paid, collected or withheld, all Taxes required to

assessments, audits, examinations, investigations or other Actions pending
against a Target Company in respect of any Tax, and no Target Company has been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or assessments against it

(other than another Target Company) (i) under any applicable Tax Law, (ii) as
a transferee or successor, or (iii) by contract, indemnity or otherwise. No
Target Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement, Tax
sharing agreement or Tax allocation agreement or similar agreement,

Governmental Authority) that will be binding on the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to any period following the Closing Date.

distribution of such Exchange Shares; (c) has been advised and understands
that the Exchange Shares (i) are being issued in reliance upon one or more
exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws, (ii) have not been and shall not be

financial experience of such Seller's "purchaser representatives" (as that

capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the Purchaser
and of protecting its interests in connection with this investment.
Each Seller has carefully read and understands all materials provided by or
on behalf of the Purchaser or its Representatives to such Seller or such
Seller's Representatives pertaining to an investment in the Purchaser and has
consulted, as such Seller has deemed advisable, with its own attorneys,
accountants or investment advisors with respect to the investment contemplated

Exchange Shares are subject to dilution for events not under the control of
such Seller. Each Seller has completed its independent inquiry and has relied
fully upon the advice of its own legal counsel, accountant, financial and
other Representatives in determining the legal, tax, financial and other
consequences of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
the suitability of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
for such Seller and its particular circumstances, and, except as set forth
herein, has not relied upon any representations or advice by the Purchaser or
its Representatives. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that such Seller has
not been guaranteed or represented to by any Person, (i) any specific amount
or the event of the distribution of any cash, property or other interest in
the Purchaser or (ii) the profitability or value of the Exchange Shares in any
manner whatsoever. Each Seller: (A) has been represented by independent
counsel (or has had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel and
has declined to do so); (B) has had the full right and opportunity to consult
with such Seller's attorneys and other advisors and has availed itself of
this right and opportunity; (C) has carefully read and fully understands this

legal effect thereof; and (E) is competent to execute this Agreement and has
executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence.

5.9  _Independent Investigation_. Each Seller has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of
operations, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the
Purchaser, and acknowledges that it has been provided adequate access to the
personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of the Purchaser for such purpose. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it has
relied solely upon its own investigation and the express representations and
warranties of the Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries set forth in
_Article III_ (including the related portions of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules and any Supplemental Disclosure Schedules provided by the
Purchaser); and (b) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Representatives have
made any representation or warranty as to the Purchaser or this Agreement,
except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ (including the related
portions of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and Supplemental Disclosure
Schedules provided by the Purchaser).

Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Documents; (b) in the Proxy Documents; or (c) in

as practicable to the Purchaser's equity holders as and to the extent such
dissemination is required by U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and

with respect to the Proxy Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity under the
circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or material oral
responses to such comments. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to "clear" comments from the SEC and its
staff and to permit the Company and its Representatives to participate with
the Purchaser or its Representatives in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC and its staff. The Company and the Sellers shall, and shall cause each of
the Target Companies to, make their respective directors, officers and

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify each other
Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information

its directors, officers, employees or shareholders with respect to this

11.3  _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the

subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably detailed

such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis within
ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such
other parties subject to such Dispute (the " _Resolution Period_ ");
_provided_ , that if any Dispute would reasonably be expected to have become
moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days after the

ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as applicable) to comply with
only one or the other of the proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be in
writing and shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's
reason(s) for selecting one or the other proposal. The seat of arbitration

this _Section 11.5_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal

11.6  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be
inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such
Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

  



  

11.8  _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

in the representations and warranties by such other non-Affiliated
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)

condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be
bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by a Party
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

referred to herein, including any exhibits, annexes and schedules attached
hereto, which exhibits, annexes and schedules are incorporated herein by
