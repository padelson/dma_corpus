computations and workpapers used by the Seller Representative or its
representatives in connection with the review of Buyers Closing Schedule or
the preparation of Sellers Dispute Notice, subject, in the case of
accountants workpapers, to execution of a customary access agreement by
Buyers (or their representatives) if required by such accountants. Buyers and
their representatives shall be permitted to ask questions of and receive
answers from any Person necessary including, without limitation, the
Seller Representative and request such other books as are reasonably
requested by Buyers to assist it in the review of Sellers Dispute Notice.
The Seller Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items
other than the Disputed Items contained in Buyers Closing Schedule, and if
no Sellers Dispute Notice is received by Buyers within such 30-day period,
Buyers calculation of Adjusted Net Worth as set forth in Buyers Closing
Schedule shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.    

 (b) Upon receipt by Buyers of Sellers Dispute Notice, if any, the Seller Representative and Buyers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to Adjusted Net Worth set forth in Sellers Dispute Notice. To the extent Buyers and the Seller Representative are unable to agree with respect to Adjusted Net Worth within 30 days after receipt by Buyers of Sellers Dispute Notice, Buyers and the Seller Representative shall jointly engage a mutually acceptable nationally recognized public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") and promptly submit any unresolved Disputed Items (and their respective proposed calculations) to the Accounting Firm for a binding resolution (it being understood the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not an arbitrator). The reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party whose calculation of the aggregate dollar amount of all Disputed Items is the furthest from the aggregate dollar amount of such Disputed Items as finally determined by the Accounting Firm.   

 (c) The Seller Representative and Buyers shall instruct the Accounting Firm to render its decision resolving the Disputed Items within 30 days after its engagement. Buyers, Sellers and the Seller Representative agree that the determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon the parties absent manifest error and that judgment may be entered upon the    ##### 

  

 

determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party or parties against which such determination is to be enforced. The
Accounting Firm shall determine, based solely on presentations by Buyers and
the Seller Representative and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review, only those Disputed Items and shall prepare a written
report as to the dispute and the resulting calculation of Adjusted Net Worth
which shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties absent manifest error.
In resolving any Disputed Item, the Accounting Firm: (x) shall be bound by
the principles set forth in this Section 1.4 and the definition of Adjusted
Net Worth, (y) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in Buyers Closing Schedule and Sellers Dispute Notice, and (z) shall
further limit its review solely to whether the Buyers Closing Schedule is
mathematically accurate and has been prepared in accordance with GAAP and
this Section 1.4. The determination of the Accounting Firm for any Disputed
Item cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest
value, respectively, claimed for that particular item in the proposed
calculations submitted to the Accounting Firm.    

 (d) Within 15 days after the final determination of Adjusted Net Worth Buyers or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall make the following payments:    

(i) In the event that Adjusted Net Worth is equal to or greater than
Target Net Worth and the Cash of the Companies on the Closing Date is greater
than $2,500,000, Buyers shall make a cash payment to Sellers in an amount
equal to $1.00 for every $1.00 that the Cash of the Companies on the Closing
Date exceeds $2,500,000, together with simple interest thereon at the Prime
Rate as of the opening of business on the Closing Date computed from the
Closing Date until the date of payment;    

(ii) In the event that Adjusted Net Worth is equal to or greater than
Target Net Worth, Buyers shall make a cash payment to Sellers in an amount
equal to $0.50 for every $1.00 that Adjusted Net Worth is greater than Target
Net Worth, together with simple interest thereon at the Prime Rate as of the
opening of business on the Closing Date computed from the Closing Date until
the date of payment; provided, that for purposes of this paragraph, the
maximum Adjusted Net Worth to be taken into account shall be $42,000,000;
and    

(iii) In the event that Adjusted Net Worth is less than Target Net Worth,
Sellers shall make a cash payment to Buyers, within 15 days after the final
determination of Adjusted Net Worth, in an amount equal to such deficiency,
together with simple interest thereon at the Prime Rate as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date computed from the Closing Date until the date of
payment.   

 (e) For the purposes of this Section 1.4, "Target Net Worth" shall be defined as an amount equal to $32,000,000 plus $2.00 for every $1.00 that the Cash of the Companies on the Closing Date is less than $2,500,000, but in no event shall "Target Net Worth" be in excess of $37,000,000.   

 1.5 _Performance Payments_.    ##### 

  

  

 (a) The Sellers shall be entitled to receive Performance Payments in an amount up to a maximum of $17,000,000, in the aggregate, contingent upon attainment of certain performance targets as follows:

(1) $15,000,000, the Sellers shall be entitled to receive a
Performance Payment of $400,000, payable to the order of Sellers as provided
in Section 1.1(c)(i) of the Disclosure Letter.   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Sellers fail to earn the Performance Payments described in subsections 1.5(a)(i)(2) or 1.5(a)(ii)(2) above, Sellers may carry back any EBIT amounts in excess of the performance targets described in subsections 1.5(a)(ii)2 and 1.5(a)(iii)2 above and allocate such excess amounts to the EBIT at the close of the First Pay-Out Period and/or Second Pay-Out Period in order to earn the Performance Payments described in subsections 1.5(a)(i)2 or 1.5(a)(ii)2 that were not earned by Sellers at the close of the First Pay-Out Period and/or Second Pay-Out Period.   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.5(a), the Performance Payments described in subsections 1.5(a)(i)(1), 1.5(a)(ii)(1), 1.5(a)(iii)(1), 1.5(a)(iv)(1) and 1.5(a)(v)(1) above shall only be payable for those years in which Gen Fukunaga has acted as President of Productions Company.   

 (d) The following items shall be disregarded in the calculation of EBIT for purposes of determining Performance Payments for any Pay-Out Period: (i) all Transaction Expenses incurred by the Companies; (ii) acquisitions of more than 50% of the equity interests or all or substantially all of the assets of an entity by either Company following the Closing Date and any and all costs and expenses associated therewith; and (iii) borrowings of either Company following the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business and any and all principal amortization, costs and expenses associated therewith.   

 (e) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after receipt by Buyers of audited financial statements for the Pay-Out Period in question (but not later than 120 days after the end of such Pay-Out Period), Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a statement setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers calculation of EBIT for such Pay-Out Period (a "Calculation Statement"). Buyers will give the Seller Representative (or its representatives) reasonable access to any computations and workpapers used in connection with the preparation of the Calculation Statement. Buyers calculation of EBIT shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to Section 1.5(d). If Buyers employ a firm of independent accountants in connection with the preparation of EBIT, Buyers shall cause such independent accountants to give reasonable access to the Seller Representative (or its representatives) to any computations and workpapers used in the preparation of EBIT subject, in the case of accountants workpapers, to execution of a customary access agreement by the Seller Representative (or its representatives) if required by such independent accountants. On not less than 5 days prior written notice, Buyers will also give the Seller Representative (and its representatives) access, during the normal business hours of Buyers and the Companies, to all personnel, books and records of the Companies as reasonably requested by the Seller Representative to assist it, if applicable, in the preparation of a Performance Payment Dispute Notice (as defined below).

The Seller Representative will deliver to Buyers a notice ("Performance Payment Dispute Notice") within 30 days after receiving a Calculation Statement if the Seller Representative believes that Buyers    ##### 

  

 

calculation of EBIT as set forth in the Calculation Statement (i) has not been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to Section 1.5(d) or (ii) is not
mathematically correct, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all
disputed items, the basis for such disagreement, the dollar amounts involved
(the "Performance Payment Disputed Items") and the Seller
Representatives calculation of EBIT. The Seller Representative will give
Buyers (or their representatives) reasonable access to any computations and
workpapers used by the Seller Representative or its representative in
connection with the review of the Calculation Statement or the preparation of
the Performance Payment Dispute Notice, subject, in the case of accountants
workpapers, to execution of a customary access agreement by Buyers (or their
representatives) if required by such accountants. Buyers and their
representatives shall be permitted to ask questions of and receive answers
from any Person including, without limitation, the Seller Representative and
request such other books and records as are reasonably requested by Buyers to
assist it in the review of a Performance Payment Dispute Notice. The Seller
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items other than
the Performance Payment Disputed Items contained in the
Calculation Statement, and if no Performance Payment Dispute Notice is
received by Buyers within such 30-day period, Buyers calculation of EBIT as
set forth in the Calculation Statement shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto.    

 (f) Upon receipt by Buyers of a Performance Payment Dispute Notice, if any, the Seller Representative and Buyers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to the Performance Payment Disputed Items set forth in the Performance Payment Dispute Notice. To the extent Buyers and the Seller Representative are unable to agree within 30 days after receipt by Buyers of a Performance Payment Dispute Notice, Buyers and the Seller Representative shall jointly engage the Accounting Firm and promptly submit any unresolved Performance Payment Disputed Items (and their respective proposed calculations) to the Accounting Firm for a binding resolution (it being understood the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not an arbitrator). The reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party whose calculation of the aggregate dollar amount of all Performance Payment Disputed Items is the furthest from the aggregate dollar amount of such Performance Payment Disputed Items as finally determined by the Accounting Firm.   

 (g) The Seller Representative and Buyers shall instruct the Accounting Firm to render its decision resolving the Performance Payment Disputed Items within 30 days after its engagement. Buyers, Sellers and the Seller Representative agree that the determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon the parties absent manifest error and that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party or parties against which such determination is to be enforced. The Accounting Firm shall determine, based solely on presentations by Buyers and the Seller Representative and their respective representatives, and not by independent review, only those Performance Payment Disputed Items and shall prepare a written report as to the dispute and the resulting calculation of EBIT which shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties absent manifest error. In resolving any Performance Payment Disputed Item, the Accounting Firm: (x) shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section 1.5 and the definition of EBIT, (y) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the Calculation Statement and the Performance Payment Dispute Notice, and (z) shall further limit its review solely to whether the Calculation Statement is mathematically accurate and has been prepared in accordance with GAAP and Section 1.5(d). The determination of the Accounting Firm for any Performance Payment Disputed Item cannot, however, be in excess of, nor    ##### 

  

 

less than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that
particular item in the proposed calculations submitted to the Accounting
Firm.

untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, (b) the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,

Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, any state securities laws or any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Securities
Exchange Act or any state securities laws.   

 (e) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days, after Buyers, Navarre or Sellers shall receive any notice of, or otherwise become aware of, the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding or the assertion of any claim, for which indemnification is provided for by Section 8.2(a), (b) or (d) (an "Indemnification Event"), the party entitled to such indemnification (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice (an "Indemnification Claim") to the party (or in the case of any Seller who is an Indemnified Party, to the Seller Representative) from which such indemnification is (or, under such assumption, could be) sought (an "Indemnifying Party") describing in reasonable detail the Indemnification Event and the basis on which indemnification is (or, under such assumption, could be) sought; but the failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnification Claim within such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder in respect of such Indemnification Event (or the facts or circumstances giving rise thereto) except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced or harmed as a consequence of such failure.    ##### 

  

  

 (f) If any Indemnification Event involves the claim of any third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party shall (whether or not the Indemnified Party is entitled to claim indemnification under Section 8.2(a), (b) or (d), as the case may be) be entitled to, and the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with the right to, participate in, and assume sole control over, the defense and settlement of such Third-Party Claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party); provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties shall provide written notice to the Indemnified Party of its or their election to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim (and in the case of Sellers as the Indemnifying Party in accordance with their joint and several obligations under Section 8.2, shall be provided to Buyers and/or Navarre by a single written notice duly executed by the Seller Representative), (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such Third-Party Claim, provided that if there is an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, which in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party would prevent one counsel from representing both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in any matter, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for all such reasonable counsel expenses of the Indemnified Party to the extent the Indemnifying Party is found to be liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and in the case of an approval required by Sellers as the Indemnified Party, shall be communicated to Buyers and/or Navarre as the Indemnifying Party by a single notice duly executed by the Seller Representative), before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim or ceasing to defend against such Third-Party Claim if (x) as a result of such settlement or ceasing to defend, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or (y) in the case of a settlement, the Indemnified Party would not thereby receive from the claimant an unconditional release from all further Liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim. After written notice by the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnified Party of its or their election to assume control of the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, subject to the provisions of the following exceptions, the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable hereunder to indemnify any Person for any Legal Expenses subsequently incurred in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties do not assume sole control over the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim as provided in this Section 8.2(f) within a reasonable period of time, or, after assuming such control, fails to diligently defend against such Third-Party Claim in good-faith (it being agreed that settlement of such Third-Party Claim does not constitute such a failure to defend) the Indemnified Party shall have the right (as to itself) to defend and, upon obtaining the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such Indemnifying Party is liable for the Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim, settle the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with in Section 8.2(a), (b) or (d), as appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(f), the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take over and assume the control (as to itself) of the defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that in such event and if the Indemnified Party has not taken over control of such Third Party Claim under the previous sentence the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties shall cease to have any obligation under Section 8.2(a), (b) or (d), as the case may be, in respect of such Third-Party Claim. The    ##### 

  

 

Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Section 8.2(f) for any
settlement or compromise affected without its consent.    

 (g) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each cooperate fully (and shall each cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully) with the other in the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.2(f). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each such Person shall furnish the other such Person (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) with such documentary or other evidence as is then in its or any of its Affiliates possession as may reasonably be requested by the other Person for the purpose of defending against any such Third-Party Claim.   

 (h) If at any time subsequent to the receipt by an Indemnified Party of an indemnity payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) actually receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment with respect to the Loss for which it received such indemnity payment (the "Recovery"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the amount of such Recovery, less any expense incurred by such Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) in connection with such Recovery, but in no event shall any such payment exceed the amount of such indemnity payment.   

 (i) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any payment made by Buyers, Navarre or Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   

 (j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (i) this Section 8.2 shall have no application to claims for indemnification with respect to Section 3.12, which claims are governed exclusively by Section 10.1, (ii) the time limitations set forth in Section 8.1, and the Basket Amount and the aggregate indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8.2(b), shall not apply to Losses arising from representations made with the knowledge that such representations were false at the time they were made or fraudulent acts or failures to act, and (iii) the limitations set forth in Sections 8.2(b)(A), (B) and (C) shall not apply to Losses arising in respect of claims for any breach of any representation and warranty contained in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 3.1(b), 3.3, clause (i) of Section 3.4(a), Section 3.19, Section 4.2, clause (i) of Section 4.3, or Section 4.6.   

 (k) For purposes of this Article 8, any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any materiality or knowledge qualifiers set forth in such representation or warranty, and all references to materiality and knowledge qualifiers shall be ignored for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty was true and correct when made.   

 8.3 _Set-Off_. Without limiting any of the other rights Buyers and/or Navarre may have at law or in equity to recover from the Sellers in respect of claims made pursuant to this Article 8, Buyers and/or Navarre may set-off an amount equal to Buyers or Navarres reasonable estimate of such claim(s) against any payment or payments coming due to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement including without, limitation, the Performance Payments, said set-off to be made against such payments in the order in which they come due; provided, however, to the extent that Buyers and/or Navarre exercises their right of set-off, it shall promptly notify the Sellers of the basis for such set-off and, within 15 days thereafter, Buyers and/or Navarre, as the case may be, shall negotiate in good faith with the Sellers to attempt to resolve any dispute. If it is ultimately determined that Buyers    ##### 

  

 

and/or Navarre wrongfully set-off any amount (or portion thereof) against any
payment due the Sellers, such amount shall be promptly paid to the
Sellers.    

 8.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each partys rights of indemnification contained in this Article 8 shall, from and after the Closing Date, be its sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Losses in connection with Third Party Claims), except as provided in Section 10.1 and except for Losses arising from representations made with the knowledge that such representations were false at the time they were made or fraudulent acts or failures to act.   

ARTICLE 9    

 _TERMINATION_     

 9.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing:   

 (a) by the mutual consent of the Seller Representative and Buyers;   

 (b) by Buyers or the Seller Representative, if the Closing has not taken place on or prior to the Outside Date, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this Agreement or breach of a representation or warranty contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;   

 (c) by Buyers or the Seller Representative, if any court or Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any other material foreign jurisdiction shall have issued an Order, or taken any other action, permanently prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order, or other action, shall have become final and non-appealable; or   

 (d) by either Buyers or the Seller Representative if there has been a material breach by (i) any of Sellers, the Seller Representative or the Companies, in the case of termination by Buyers, or (ii) Buyers or Navarre, in the case of termination by the Seller Representative, of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such person in this Agreement, which would permit such other person or persons not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, following written notice from the terminating party and the failure to cure any such material breach by the breaching party within 30 days of receipt of such notice.   

 (e) In the event that Buyers and/or Navarre fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby by the Outside Date due to Buyers and/or Navarres failure to secure financing necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyers or Navarre shall pay to Sellers, as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for the Buyers or Navarres failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, a termination fee in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000.   

 (f) In the event that Sellers fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby by the Outside Date in order to pursue a competing offer for the sale of the Partnership    ##### 

  

 

Interests of all or substantially all of the assets of the Companies, Sellers
shall pay to Buyers and/or Navarre, as Buyers and Navarres sole and
exclusive remedy for the Sellers failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, a termination fee in the aggregate amount
of $2,500,000.    

 (g) In the event of termination of the Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of this Section 9.1 and of Section 11.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   

ARTICLE 10    

 _CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_     

 10.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.   

 (a) Buyers and Sellers acknowledge that for U.S. Federal income tax purposes the Companies shall be deemed to have terminated as of the Closing Date and both Companies taxable years shall close on the Closing Date (the "Final Year"). Sellers shall prepare and file or cause to be filed by the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries (to the extent of the Companies aggregate direct and indirect ownership of a Company Subsidiary) any Income Tax Returns required to be filed by the Companies for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), including, without limitation, any partnership Tax Return for the Final Year and all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If requested by Buyers, the partnership Tax Returns for the Final Year shall include an election under Section 754 of the Code. Buyers shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all other Tax Returns of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due after the Closing; provided, however, that (i) drafts of any such Tax Returns shall be provided to Seller Representative for his review prior to filing, and (ii) such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and in accordance with the then applicable Tax law.   

 (b) Each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify Buyers Indemnitees and hold them harmless from and against, on a Net After Tax Basis, (i) any and all Taxes imposed on either of the Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) any and all Taxes imposed on either of the Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (as defined in Section 10.1(d) below); (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than either Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) imposed on any of the Companies or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before, or as a result of, the Closing, or as a result of being a member of an affiliated group, or being included in a combined, consolidated, or unitary income or similar Tax Return, prior to the Closing, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6; (iv) any and all Taxes imposed or other Losses (including, without limitation, any reasonable Legal Expenses) as a result of the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.12 or this Article 10 and (v) any and all Taxes imposed upon any Seller for any period.    ##### 

  

  

 (c) Buyers shall prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries for any period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period" ) and will notify Seller Representative of Buyers calculation of the Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined in accordance with Section 10.1(d)); provided, however, that drafts of any such Tax Returns and calculations shall be provided to Seller Representative at least 60 days prior to filing. Buyers and Seller Representative shall attempt to resolve in good faith any disagreement arising out of any Straddle Period Tax Return and/or any calculation of Sellers share of the related Tax liability; if any such dispute is not resolved within 30 days prior to the deadline for filing the Tax Return in question, the matter shall be submitted for binding resolution to a mutually acceptable nationally recognized accounting firm in the relevant jurisdiction with no material relationship to Buyers or Sellers. The accounting firm will have 10 days within which to resolve the disagreement. Buyers and Sellers will share the fees and expenses of the accounting firm jointly.   

 (d) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of any Company or Company Subsidiary attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (such portion, a "Pre-Closing Straddle Period" ) with respect to (x) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied on a per diem basis ("Per Diem Taxes"), shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period, and (y) the Taxes of any Company or Company Subsidiary (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary as of the close of business on the Closing Date; provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual or periodic basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.   

 (e) After the Closing Date, each of Buyers and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other (subject to reimbursement by the requesting party for any out-of-pocket expenses), upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books, records and personnel) and assistance as is reasonably requested for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or related document, for the preparation for any Tax audit or for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to Liability for Taxes of Sellers, Buyers, the Companies or any Company Subsidiary. Buyers further agree to retain and provide Sellers with access to all books and records relevant to the Liability of Sellers for Taxes for any periods prior to Closing for at least five years after the Closing and to give Sellers notice and an opportunity to receive such books or records prior to destroying or discarding any such books or records.   

 (f) Buyers shall, in the event that Buyers or, following the Closing Date, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries receive notice (in writing) of any audit, examination or claim by any taxing authority with respect to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Buyers Indemnitees may be indemnified hereunder (a "Tax Claim"), promptly notify Seller Representative thereof. Buyers shall have the sole right to contest any Tax Claim through    ##### 

  

 

appropriate administrative and judicial procedures, and shall be entitled to
control any such contest. Buyers (i) shall keep Seller Representative
reasonably informed of the status of any such Tax Claim and (ii) shall not
pay or compromise any Tax liability asserted in such Tax Claim for which the
Sellers have an indemnification obligation hereunder without the Seller
Representatives prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.    

 (g) Sellers will be entitled to retain, or to receive prompt payment from Buyers or the Companies of, any refund or credit for overpayment of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Section 10.1, plus any interest received or credited with respect thereto, from the relevant taxing authorities, except to the extent any such refund or credit is taken into account in determining the Adjusted Net Worth. Buyers will be entitled to retain, or to receive prompt payment from Sellers of, any refund or credit for overpayment of Taxes of the Companies that Sellers are not entitled to retain or receive pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, plus any interest received or credited with respect thereto, from the relevant taxing authorities. Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate with respect to claiming any refund or credit with respect to Taxes referred to in this Section 10.1(g). For purposes of this Section 10.1(g), a party will be deemed to have made prompt payment of a refund or credit if such payment is made within 10 Business Days of the receipt by such party of such refund or of the use by such party of such credit.   

 (h) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges, real property gains, and similar fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the sale of the Partnership Interests (or any deemed sale of assets as the result of the sale of the Partnership Interests or as a result of the deemed sale of any ownership interests in the Company Subsidiaries) shall be paid timely by the Sellers. Buyers will be responsible for preparing and timely filing (and Sellers shall timely cooperate with Buyers in preparing and filing) any forms required with respect to any such Taxes. Buyers will provide to Sellers a true copy of each such return as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof, and Sellers will provide to Buyers evidence of timely payment thereof.   

 (i) Any indemnification payment for Taxes required by this Section 10.1 shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable law, and shall be paid within 15 Business Days after written notice of payment of, or the obligation to pay, such Taxes by the party, or any of such partys Affiliates, who must be indemnified hereunder.   

 10.2 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving any of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries and a Person (other than another Company) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no Company shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.   

 10.3 _Coordination of Provisions_. The indemnification provided for in Section 10.1 shall be the sole remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising out of or relating to a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article 10, on the one hand, and the provisions of Article 8, on the other, the provisions of this Article 10 shall control with respect to any claim relating to Taxes. For avoidance of doubt, any indemnification claim with respect to Taxes shall not be subject to the Basket Amount or the Cap.    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 11

Edwards, Inc. incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) Buyers shall reimburse Sellers for all reasonable audit and legal costs up to a maximum of $100,000, associated with the audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and (iv) if the Closing is consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all Transaction Expenses of the Companies attributable to the period prior to and ending at the Closing, other than those out-of-pocket expenses actually paid prior to the Closing, shall be deemed liabilities of the Companies as of the Closing and shall be taken into account for purposes of calculating Adjusted Net Worth.   

 11.2 _Further Assurances_. Subject to Section 9.1 hereof, from time to time prior to, at and after the Closing Date, without the payment of any additional consideration and at Buyers expense, each party hereto will execute all such instruments and take all such actions as the other parties shall reasonably request in connection with carrying out and effectuating the intent and purpose hereof and all transactions and things contemplated by this Agreement.

 11.13 _Severability_. To the fullest extent that they may effectively do so under applicable law, the parties hereto hereby waive any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect. Such parties further agree that any provision of this Agreement which, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, is rendered or held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective, but such ineffectiveness shall be limited as follows: (i) if such provision is rendered or held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in such jurisdiction only as to a particular Person or Persons or under any particular circumstance or circumstances, such provision shall be ineffective, but only in such jurisdiction and only with respect to such particular Person or Persons or under such particular circumstance or circumstances, as the case may be; (ii) without limitation of clause (i), such provision shall in any event be ineffective only as to such jurisdiction and only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not render invalid, illegal or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction; and (iii) without limitation of clause (i) or (ii), such ineffectiveness shall not render invalid, illegal or unenforceable this Agreement or any of the remaining provisions hereof. Without limitation of the preceding sentence, (A) it is the intent of the parties hereto that, in the event that in any court proceeding, such court determines that any provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction to any extent, such court shall have the power to, and shall, (1) modify such provision (including by limiting the Persons against whom, or the circumstances under which, such provision shall be effective in such jurisdiction) for purposes of such proceeding to the minimum extent necessary so that such provision, as so modified, may then be enforced in such proceeding and (2) enforce such provision, as so modified pursuant to clause (1), in such proceeding and (B) upon any determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of such parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 11.14 _Seller Representative_.   

 (a) Sellers hereby authorize and direct the Seller Representative to take such action, and to exercise such rights, power and authority, as are authorized, delegated and granted to the Seller Representative hereunder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental thereto. Execution of this Agreement by Sellers shall constitute ratification by Sellers of the appointment of the Seller Representative in accordance herewith and agreement to be bound by the actions of the Seller Representative taken hereunder.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 11.14(b), the Seller Representative shall serve as such from the date hereof until the earlier of his removal or the completion of his obligations hereunder. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, as to all matters arising under this Agreement, the Seller Representative shall act for and on behalf of Sellers.

The Sellers shall severally indemnify the Seller Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of such Seller Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.   

 (e) The Seller Representative shall act without any compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Representative shall be promptly reimbursed by the Sellers for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in his capacity of Seller Representatives.    #####
