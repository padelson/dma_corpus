against any fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan, and the Sellers do not have Knowledge of any
facts that could give rise to any such actions, claims, lawsuits or arbitrations. There has not
occurred any circumstances by reason of which either Company or any Company Subsidiary may be
liable for an act, or a failure to act, by a fiduciary with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

any provision of this Agreement which, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, is rendered or held

provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of such
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

exercise such rights, power and authority, as are authorized, delegated and granted to the Seller
Representative hereunder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to exercise

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;11.14(b), the Seller Representative shall serve
as such from the date hereof until the earlier of his removal or the completion of his obligations
hereunder. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, as to all matters arising under this
Agreement, the Seller Representative shall act for and on behalf of Sellers. When this Agreement
provides that a determination or any other action or event is conclusive and binding upon Sellers,
such determination, action or event of the Seller Representative shall be conclusive and binding
upon Sellers. In addition, the Seller Representative shall have all such incidental powers as may
be necessary or desirable to carry into effect the provisions of this Section&nbsp;11.14, including, at
the expense of Sellers, to retain attorneys, accountants and other advisors to assist him in the
performance of his duties hereunder. In the event that the Person who is acting as the Seller
Representative is terminated by Sellers, his successor shall be appointed by Seller in accordance
with this Section&nbsp;11.14. Upon the resignation of any Seller Representative, a successor Seller
Representative (and, if necessary, further successor Seller Representatives), shall be appointed by
the Seller Representative or in the event of his death, or his failure to so appoint a successor by
the other Sellers. Any successor to a Seller Representative shall for purposes of this Agreement
be deemed to be, for the time of the appointment thereof, a Seller Representative and from and
after such time, the term &#147;Seller Representative&#148; as used herein shall be deemed to refer to any
successor. No appointment of a successor shall be effective unless such successor agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sellers agree that the provisions set forth in this Section&nbsp;11.14 shall in no way impose
any obligations on Buyers and/or Navarre other than those explicitly set forth in this Agreement.
In particular, notwithstanding in any case any notice received by Buyers and/or Navarre to the
contrary, Buyers and Navarre shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled (i)&nbsp;to
rely upon actions, decisions and determinations of the Seller Representative and (ii)&nbsp;to assume
that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Seller Representative are fully authorized
and binding upon the Seller Representative and Sellers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Seller further agrees that Seller Representative (A)&nbsp;shall not incur any personal
liability for acting in such capacity if in doing so he acts upon advice of counsel or otherwise
acts in good faith, (B)&nbsp;shall not incur any personal liability for acting in such capacity in the
absence of his gross negligence or willful misconduct, (C)&nbsp;may act upon any instrument or signature
believed by him to be genuine and may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice or
instruction under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or document believed by him to be
authorized has been authorized to do so. The Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Seller Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted by pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Sellers shall severally indemnify the Seller
Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of such Seller Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seller Representative shall act without any compensation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller Representative shall be promptly reimbursed by the Sellers for all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in his capacity of Seller Representatives.
