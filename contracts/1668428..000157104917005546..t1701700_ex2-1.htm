the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.04(a)_ , without

Section 3.01 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company) with the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to
this _Article III_ , in the case of certificated Shares, and automatically, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount
required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares (such cash
amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article III _ and shall not be used to satisfy any
other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Pending
distribution of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article III_ ,
Parent may direct the Paying Agent to invest such cash; _provided_ , that (a)
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the Company Stockholders and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company Stockholders in the amount of any
such losses and (b) such investments (i) shall be obligations of or guaranteed
by the United States of America, commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard
and Poor's Corporation, or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of domestic commercial banks with capital exceeding
$500,000,000 (collectively " _Permitted Investments_ ") or money market funds
that are invested solely in Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have
maturities that will not prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this _Article III_. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be
payable solely to Parent. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares subsequently converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section
2.04_ (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that (A)
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any
bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by _Section 3.06_ ) and (B)
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may specify, subject to the Company's reasonable approval (to be
sought prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
executed, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.04_ and (ii) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each such Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the
Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall
be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable and in any event within
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed
or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable Taxes have been paid.

  



  

Section 3.03 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article III_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of
Appraisal Shares.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the
date twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received
any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is
entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of
claims with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 3.05 _No Liability_. None of CF Corp, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
Shares two years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.06 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the
execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.07 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to

  



    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any holder of Shares, Appraisal Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
Performance RSUs, Company Restricted Stock Rights or cash-settled awards
described in _Section 2.07(d)_ , such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof,
or the Paying Agent are paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law or Order, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be.

other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, the Equity Commitment
Letters, and to the Knowledge of CF Corp, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be likely to (i) constitute or result in a breach or
default on the part of any Person under the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii)
constitute or result in a failure by CF Corp or the Equity Providers to
satisfy a condition precedent to or other contingency to be satisfied by CF

make any of the statements by CF Corp or the Equity Providers set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect or (iv)

subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub) of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ , CF Corp,
Parent and Merger Sub (A) have no reason to believe CF Corp will not be able
to satisfy on a timely basis each term and condition to be satisfied by CF

of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be
likely to (1) cause the Equity Commitment Letters to terminate, to be

to the closing or funding of any portion of the Equity Financing not to be

Equity Commitment Letters to fund or invest, as applicable, the full amount
(or any portion) of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (the "
_Disclosed Conditions_ "). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, neither the
Equity Providers nor any other Person has any right to impose, and none of the
Equity Providers, CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary
obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to any funding
of the Equity Financing nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available

have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Equity
Commitment Letters). There are no side letters and (except for the Equity
Commitment Letters) there are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with the Equity Providers or any
other Person relating to the Equity Financing or the Equity Commitment
Letters that, in each case, could permit the Equity Providers to reduce their
commitments with respect to the Equity Financing. Other than as set forth in

to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing that would
reasonably be likely to, (i) impair the validity of the Equity Commitment
Letters, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing, (iii)
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iv) cause the Equity Commitment Letters to be ineffective, or (v) otherwise

Forward Purchasers set forth in the Forward Purchase Agreements or (iii) any
intention of the Forward Purchasers to terminate the Forward Purchase
Agreements or to not provide all or any portion of the FP Financing. As
of the date hereof, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by CF Corp, Parent
and Merger Sub) of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section
7.02_ of this Agreement and the FP Disclosed Conditions, CF Corp, Parent and
Merger Sub (A) have no reason to believe CF Corp will not be able to satisfy
on a timely basis each term and condition to be satisfied by CF Corp relating
to the closing or funding of the FP Financing, (B) know of no fact,
occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be likely to (1)
cause the Forward Purchase Agreements to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified,
repudiated or rescinded or to be or become ineffective, (2) cause any of the
terms or conditions to be satisfied by CF Corp relating to the closing or
funding of any portion of the FP Financing not to be met or complied with, or

contemplated to be available under the Forward Purchase Agreements to not be

Disclosed Conditions_ "). Other than the FP Disclosed Conditions, neither the
Forward Purchasers nor any other Person has any right to impose, and none of
the Forward Purchasers, CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to

are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written
or oral, with the Forward Purchasers or any other Person relating to the FP

the Forward Purchasers to reduce their commitments with respect to the FP
Financing. Other than as set forth in the Forward Purchase Agreements, there
are no conditions precedent relating to the funding of the full amount of the
FP Financing that would reasonably be likely to, (i) impair the validity of
the Forward Purchase Agreements, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the FP
Financing, (iii) prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) cause the Forward Purchase Agreements to be
ineffective, or (v) otherwise result in the FP Financing not being

breach or default on the part of any Person under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent to or
other contingency to be satisfied set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) make any of the statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect or (iv) subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver by CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub) of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01 _ and _Section 7.02_ , otherwise result in any portion of the
Debt Financing not being available.

  



  

(d) As of the date hereof, none of CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub has
received any notice or other communication from any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to (i) any actual or threatened breach or
default on the part of CF Corp or any other party to the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) any actual or threatened failure to satisfy any condition
precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letter or (iii) any intention of such party to terminate
the Debt Commitment Letter or to not provide all or any portion of amount

and _Section 7.02_ , CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub (both before and after

Commitment Letter): (A) have no reason to believe CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates will not be able to satisfy on a timely
basis each term and condition to be satisfied by any of them relating to the
closing or funding of the Debt Financing, (B) know of no fact,
occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be likely to (1)
cause the Debt Commitment Letter to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified,
repudiated or rescinded or to be or become ineffective, (2) cause any of the
terms or conditions to be satisfied by CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates relating to the closing or funding of any portion
of the Debt Financing not to be met or complied with, or (3) otherwise cause
the full

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated to be available under the
Debt Commitment Letter to not be available to CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub
on a timely basis (and in any event as of the Closing) and (C) know of no
potential impediment to the funding of any of the payment obligations of CF
Corp, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement. CF Corp, Parent and/or

date hereof, and CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub will pay when due all other
commitment or other fees arising under the Debt Commitment Letter as and when

(e) There are no, and there will not be any, conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the Debt Financing as contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment

the Debt Disclosed Conditions, no Debt Financing Source nor any other Person
has any right to impose, and none of the Equity Providers, CF Corp, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to
accept, any condition precedent to any funding of the Debt Financing nor any
reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letter
(nor any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the
aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letter). Other than the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, neither CF Corp nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other contractual
arrangement (in each case, whether oral or written), relating to the Debt
Financing, other than (i) as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the
Fee Letter, (ii) customary administrative agent engagement letters or non-
disclosure agreements which do not impact the conditionality of the Debt
Financing or (iii) those that would not be reasonably expected to adversely
affect the availability of any portion of the Debt Financing and which do not
impact the conditionality of the Debt Financing. Other than as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, there are no conditions
precedent relating to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
that would reasonably be likely to, (i) impair the validity of the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing,
(iii) prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iv) cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective, or (v)
otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being available on a timely basis
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

of the financing required to (i) repay, redeem and/or refinance all

Financing (clauses (i) and (ii) are collectively referred to herein as the "

(g) CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly (and

consent, approval, authorization, waiver or exemption is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic
communications, and shall promptly advise each other when any such
communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization, waiver or
exemption will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent,
approval, authorization, waiver or exemption will be materially delayed or
conditioned.

  



  

(h) None of CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, permit any of

no event shall the Company or its Affiliates be required to agree to take or
enter into any action which would be required to be taken in the event that
the Closing does not occur.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the normal business and operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) take any action that would cause
any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to incur any personal liability or (iii) provide access to or

acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall take all actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the
Company By-laws and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to duly call,
give notice of, convene and promptly hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for

the Company Board of Directors shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders and include such
recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to CF
Corp, the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that the Company

under circumstances as specified in _Section 6.06_ , take all lawful action
to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
Company Stockholders that are required by the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange and the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with CF Corp, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Company Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

to provide the holders of CF Corp Class A Shares with the opportunity to
redeem such CF Corp Class A Shares in accordance with CF Corp's Amended and
Restated Articles of Association (the " _CF Corp Shareholder Redemption_

Directors shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of CF Corp
Shareholder Proposals and include such recommendation in the CF Corp Proxy
Statement, and (ii) neither CF Corp's Board of Directors nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to

Proposals and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the CF Corp Shareholders that are

Revision). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, CF Corp, after consultation the Company, may adjourn or postpone
the CF Corp Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
legally required supplement or amendment to the CF Corp Proxy Statement is
provided to the CF Corp Shareholders or, if as of the time for which the CF
Corp Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the CF
Corp Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of CF Corp Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the CF Corp Shareholders Meeting. CF Corp hereby
acknowledges that, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, each of the shareholders
of CF Corp party thereto has irrevocably granted to and appointed the Company
and any designee of the Company as such shareholder's proxy to vote all of
the CF Corp Shares held by such shareholder at the CF Corp Shareholders
Meeting, solely on the matters and in the manner specified in the Voting
Agreement. CF Corp further hereby acknowledges and agrees that during
the term of the Voting Agreement, it shall recognize the grant of any such
proxy and the exercise thereof by the Company or one of its designees in
accordance with the terms thereof at the CF Corp Shareholders Meeting. CF Corp
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause CF Shareholders that
hold CF Corp Shares as of the record date for the CF Corp Shareholders Meeting
and are not a party to the Voting Agreement to deliver to the Company a duly
authorized and executed joinder to the Voting Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.06 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its directors and officers
shall not, (ii) its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' directors and officers
shall not and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

respect to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote, in response to a  _bona fide_ written Takeover
Proposal received after the date hereof that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 6.06_ , if the Company Board of Directors determines
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to), subject to compliance with _Section
6.06(c)_ , (1) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing
provisions (including standstill provisions) not less restrictive with respect
to the Person making such Takeover Proposal than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement are to CF Corp, provided that all such information
has previously been provided to CF Corp or is provided to CF Corp prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and
(2) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal,
if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (1)
and (2) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law.

  



  

(b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to CF Corp), or publicly
propose to withdraw or withhold (or modify in a manner adverse to CF Corp),
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or
(B) recommend or endorse the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or
publicly propose to recommend, endorse, approve or adopt, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "; it being understood that any "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change) or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any Takeover Proposal Documentation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of Directors
may, if, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
it determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, (1) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (2) cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order
to enter into an agreement regarding a Superior Proposal if and only if (I)
the Company has complied in all material respects with this _Section 6.06_
and shall have given CF Corp written notice at least four (4) Business Days
prior to taking such action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), that the
Company Board of Directors intends to take such action in response to a
Superior Proposal and specifying the reasons therefor, including the most
current version of any proposed agreement or, if there is no such
proposed written agreement, a reasonably detailed summary of the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal and (II) during such four (4) Business
Day period, if requested by CF Corp, the Company and its Representatives
shall engage in good faith negotiations with CF Corp and its Representatives
to amend this Agreement in such a manner

  



    

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

that any Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal taking into account any changes to
the financial terms and other material terms of this Agreement proposed by CF
Corp in writing to the Company following the Notice of Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with this
_Section 6.06(b)_ , except that reference to the four (4) Business Day period
shall be deemed a reference to a new two (2) Business Day period).

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Section 6.06(a)_ and _Section 6.06(b)_ , the Company shall as promptly as
practicable advise CF Corp of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal after the
date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board of Directors under applicable Law, keep CF Corp reasonably informed of
any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes thereto).

  



  

(d) Prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board
of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Change in Circumstance, if and only if (i) the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company shall have given CF Corp
written notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such
Adverse Recommendation Change, (iii) during such four (4) Business Day
period, if requested by CF Corp, the Company and its Representatives shall
engage in good faith negotiations with CF Corp and its Representatives to
amend this Agreement and (iv) after considering any proposed revisions to
this Agreement made by CF Corp in writing during such four (4) Business Day
period, if any, after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company
Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to
make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Change in
Circumstance would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.06_ or elsewhere in this

Contribution (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) in no less than the
amount set forth in paragraph (b)(1) or Exhibit A to the Debt Commitment

that become due and payable under or with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter), (iii) negotiate and enter into the Debt Documents (and maintain in
effect and comply in all material respects with the terms thereof) on
terms and conditions no less favorable to CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub than
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related
"market flex" provisions), which agreements shall be in effect as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, in no

other contingencies to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing beyond
those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, amend or modify any

Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates (including by making any such
conditions or other contingencies less likely to be satisfied) or impose any
new or additional condition or other contingency to the receipt or funding of
the Debt Financing; (C) contain terms (other than those terms expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter) that would reasonably be expected to (1)
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the date on which the Debt Financing would be obtained, or (2) make the
funding of Debt Financing less likely to occur; (D) adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub or their

termination thereto, (II) if and when CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware that any portion of the Debt Financing may not be available to

at any time for any reason CF Corp or Parent believes that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or Debt Documents or will be unable to
obtain Alternative Financing. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or
could reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any related "market flex" terms) contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than as a result of the Company's breach of any
provision of this Agreement, or the Company's failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ ) or the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Documents shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any
reason, CF Corp shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, without limiting the obligations of CF Corp set
forth in the second succeeding sentence, use all commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange or obtain alternative financing for any such portion from
the same or alternative sources, which may include one or more of a senior
secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any

other financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any
combination thereof (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient
to consummate the Refinancing (or replace any unavailable portion of the Debt
Financing) and to obtain a new financing commitment letter (including any
associated engagement letter and related fee letter) with respect to such
Alternative Financing (collectively, the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "),
copies of which shall be promptly provided to the Company but in any event no
later than three Business Days prior to the execution thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no New Debt Commitment Letter may expand the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in effect on the
date hereof or otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that
would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that such Debt Financing
would be funded less likely. In the event CF Corp, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates enters into any Alternative Financing, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed
to include the New Debt Commitment Letter, (B) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing
and (C) all references to the Committed Lenders and the Lead Arrangers shall
include the persons providing or arranging such Alternative Financing. CF
Corp, Parent and Merger Sub shall (1) enforce their rights (and the rights of
any of their Affiliates) under the Debt Commitment Letter and (2) other than
as set forth in the third preceding sentence, not permit or agree to permit,
without the prior written consent of the Company, any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any material waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that the exercise of
any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall be deemed not
to be an amendment, modification or waiver), in any such case if such
amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (w) impose
new or additional conditions, or otherwise modify or expand any of
the conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount) thereunder, (y) make it less
likely that the Debt Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur) or otherwise
prevent or delay or impair in any material respect the ability or likelihood
of CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Refinancing and (z)
adversely impact the ability of CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ ,
that CF Corp may amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (which
additional lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities may also become Committed Lenders). Each of CF Corp, Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to the
consummation of the transactions to be consummated at the Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, subject to fulfillment of the
conditions set forth in  _Article VII_.

(B) provide and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
respective Representatives to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
CF Corp in connection with the Consent Solicitation including appointing
a solicitation agent reasonably selected by CF Corp; (C) waive any of the
conditions to the Consent Solicitation as may be reasonably requested by CF
Corp (other than the condition that any proposed amendments set forth therein
shall not become operative unless and until the Closing has occurred), so
long as such waivers would not cause the Consent Solicitation to violate
applicable Law, and shall not, without the prior written consent of CF Corp,
waive any condition to the Consent Solicitation or make any change, amendment
or modification to the terms and conditions of any Consent Solicitation other
than as directed by CF Corp or as required by applicable Law; and (D)
promptly following the expiration of a Consent Solicitation, assuming the
requisite consent from the holders of the Company Existing Notes (including
from persons holding proxies from such holders) has been received, cause an
appropriate supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") to
become effective providing for the amendments of the Company Existing
Indenture contemplated in the Consent Solicitation Documents; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding the fact that a Supplemental Indenture may become
effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth therein shall not become
operative unless and until the Effective Time has occurred. The form and
substance of the Supplemental Indenture shall be reasonably satisfactory to
CF Corp;

  



  

(ii) (A) commence an offer to purchase, as specified by CF Corp, with

opportunity to review the Debt Tender Offer Documents and the material terms
and conditions of the Debt Tender Offer. The terms and conditions specified
by CF Corp for the Debt Tender Offer shall be in compliance in all material
respects with the Company Existing Indenture, the Company Existing Credit
Documents or any applicable Law. The closing of a Debt Tender Offer, if any,
shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the Company shall accept
for purchase and purchase the Company Existing Notes properly tendered
and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer ( _provided_ that such
purchase price shall be paid by CF Corp; _provided_ ,  _further_ that the
proposed amendments set forth in any Debt Tender Offer Document may not become
effective unless and until the Closing has occurred); (B) provide and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective Representatives
to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by CF Corp in connection with
the Debt Tender Offer, including appointing a dealer manager reasonably
selected by CF Corp. The Debt Tender Offer shall comply with the requirements

 _14e-1_ "), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the " _TIA_ "), if
applicable, and any other applicable Law, it being understood that the Company
shall not be required to take any action that, in the good faith judgment of
the Company and after consultation with Company counsel, does not comply with
Rule 14e-1, the TIA, if applicable, or other applicable Law; and (C) waive any
of the conditions to a Debt Tender Offer as may be reasonably requested by CF
Corp (other than the conditions that a Debt Tender Offer is conditioned on the
Effective Time occurring), so long as such waivers would not cause a Debt
Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA or other applicable Law,
and shall not, without the prior written consent of CF Corp, waive any
condition to a Debt Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or
modification to the terms and conditions of a Debt Tender Offer (including any
extension thereof) other than as directed by CF Corp or as required by
applicable Law;

  



  

(iii) deliver a notice to each holder of the Company Existing Notes,
in accordance with Section 3.9(b) of the Company Existing Indenture,

the Company Existing Notes Payoff Amount (it being understood that (x) any
such redemption, satisfaction and discharge shall not occur prior to the
Effective Time, (y) the Company's or CF Corp's counsel will provide customary

discharge and (z) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no
funding obligations in connection with such redemption, satisfaction and
discharge);

that (x) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, managers, consultants, accountants
or other agents or representatives, in their capacity as such, shall be

Redemption (except that the Company and its Subsidiaries may incur such
liabilities only to the extent such liabilities become effective after the

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will CF Corp or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), which Maximum Premium
is set forth in Section 6.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the annual premiums for such insurance
coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, CF Corp and the Surviving Corporation
will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that at the Company's option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage,
the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, six (6) year "tail"

by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Further, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-laws, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as amendments may be
required by the DGCL during such period.

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in _Section 6.13_ and this _Section
6.14_. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 6.14_.

  



  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.14_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such
Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|---

with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder and any
amounts payable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period
prior to the Closing Date shall be paid to the Company or any of its
applicable Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the

following conditions:

  



  

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Article V_ shall
be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as if
made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of

failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a CF

determining the satisfaction of this condition, no effect shall be given to
any exception or qualification in such representations and warranties relating
to "material," "materiality" or "CF Corp Material Adverse Effect" (other than

, this _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ shall survive termination and (b)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement (it being acknowledged and agreed by the
parties hereto that the failure to close the Merger by any party that was
otherwise obligated to do so under the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed

_provided_ , that the provisions of _Section 8.02(b)_  providing for the
Company Termination Fee shall constitute an exclusive remedy with respect to
the circumstances set forth therein.

parties in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time before or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to

 | 83| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

other terms or conditions of this Agreement if such change would materially
and adversely affect the Company or the Company Stockholders. This Agreement

an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered

parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

contrary contained herein, (i) no Company Related Party shall have any rights
or claims against any Debt Financing Source with respect to this Agreement or
the Debt Financing, and no Debt Financing Source shall have any rights or
claims against any Company Related Party with respect to this Agreement or the
Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
provided that, following consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not

shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in the Delaware Courts, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any
such action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement,
no party hereto will allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense
or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto
further agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for in this _Section
9.09_ , a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to such party hereto under this
Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 9.09_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any action for (or limit such party's right to
institute any action for) specific performance under this _Section 9.09_
before exercising any other right under this Agreement. If, prior to the
Outside Termination Date, any party hereto brings any Action in accordance
with this Agreement to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof against any other party, the Outside Termination Date shall
be automatically extended (i) for the period during which such Action is
pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (ii) by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action on good cause
shown, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Exclusions from Representations and Warranties_.
Except as expressly set forth in _Section 4.11(b)_ , notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith, each of CF
Corp, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its
Subsidiaries make no representations or warranties with respect to, and
nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement, document or
instrument to be delivered in connection herewith is intended or shall be
construed to be a representation or warranty, express or implied, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for any purposes of this Agreement or any
other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection
herewith or therewith, in respect of (a) the adequacy or sufficiency of
reserves, (b) the effect of the adequacy or

sufficiency of reserves on any line item, asset, liability or equity amount
on any financial or other document, (c) whether or not reserves were
determined in accordance with any actuarial, statutory, regulatory or other
standard or (d) the collectability of any amounts under any Reinsurance
Contract. Furthermore, each of CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges,
understands and agrees that no fact, condition, development or issue
relating to the adequacy or sufficiency of reserves may be used, directly or
indirectly, to demonstrate or support the breach or violation of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of or by the Company or its
Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Severability. _ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by the Delaware Courts or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company acknowledges that
CF Corp is a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect
a Business Combination (as defined in CF Corp's Amended and Restated Articles
of Association). The Company further acknowledges that, as described in the
prospectus dated May 19, 2016 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov,
substantially all of CF Corp's assets consist of the cash proceeds of CF
Corp's initial public offering and private placements of its securities and
substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account
for the benefit of CF Corp, certain of its public shareholders and the
underwriters of CF Corp's initial public offering. The Company acknowledges
that it has been advised by CF Corp that, except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to CF Corp
to pay its income taxes, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust
Account may be disbursed only (i) if CF Corp completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts
as described in the Prospectus; and (ii) if CF Corp fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to CF Corp in limited amounts to permit
CF Corp to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and
then to CF Corp's public shareholders. For and in consideration of CF Corp
entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any
monies in the Trust Account and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust
Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of,
this Agreement and any negotiations, contracts or agreements with CF Corp;
_provided_ that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the
Company's right to pursue a claim against CF Corp for legal relief against
monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for CF Corp to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance
of the cash remaining in the Trust Account to the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of

this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not
affect CF Corp's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the CF Corp
Shareholder Redemption, or for fraud to the extent such a claim for fraud
cannot be waived under applicable Law, and (y) nothing herein shall serve to
limit or prohibit any claims that the Company may have in the future against
CF Corp's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account upon completion of a
Business Combination (except such amounts that are payable to shareholders of
CF Corp holding CF Corp Shares sold in CF Corp's initial public offering who
shall have previously elected to redeem their CF Corp Shares pursuant to CF
Corp's Amended and Restated Articles of Association) and any assets that have
been purchased or acquired with any such funds).

  



  

Section 9.13 _CF Corp Undertaking_. CF Corp hereby fully,
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full, complete and timely
performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of its Subsidiaries,
when performance of the same shall be required in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.
