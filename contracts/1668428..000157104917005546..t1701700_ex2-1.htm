In the event that any such action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto will allege,
and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto further
agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for in this <U>Section 9.09</U>, a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its
