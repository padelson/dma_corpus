number of Preferred Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Preferred Merger
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified in Section&nbsp;2.03(e)), and such

Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares or Preferred
Shares formerly represented thereby.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>No Liability</U>. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation

Preferred Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Shares such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or
Preferred Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, as

basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent. If
for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully
satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the
amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

with Section&nbsp;2.02 prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, without
any interest thereon. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become
subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law unclaimed funds payable with respect to
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the D&#038;O Insurance or the &#147;tail&#148; policy referred

Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Section&nbsp;7.02(a) or 7.02(b), which has not
been cured (or is not capable of being cured) within 30&nbsp;days following receipt by the Company from
Parent of written notice of such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with a breach
of the representation contained in Section&nbsp;3.02 (Capitalization) that would give rise to a failure
of the condition set forth in Section&nbsp;7.02(b), an offer by the Company to amend this Agreement to
provide for a corresponding decrease in the aggregate Merger Consideration and Preferred Merger
Consideration to offset the amount of Parent&#146;s losses resulting from such breach would satisfy as
cure for such breach (unless such losses exceed $5,000,000) and, if made, would not give Parent the
right to terminate this Agreement or abandon the Merger (unless such losses exceed $5,000,000, in
which case Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger pursuant

shall pay Parent the Termination Expenses. If in addition to the foregoing, within 12&nbsp;months after
such termination, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">whatsoever Parent shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay any
Obligation, Guarantor shall unconditionally pay the Obligation. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy
the liability of Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section&nbsp;9.12 except the full
payment of the Obligations. The guarantee contained in this Section&nbsp;9.12 constitutes a guarantee
of payment when due and not of collection.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to Section&nbsp;9.12(d), the obligations of Guarantor under this Section&nbsp;9.12 shall not
be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any Obligation. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the obligations of Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section&nbsp;9.12
shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by, (i)&nbsp;the failure of any holder of a
Share or Preferred Share or any Indemnified Person to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy under this Section&nbsp;9.12; (ii)&nbsp;any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise,
in the payment of all or any part of any Obligation; or (iii)&nbsp;any other act or omission or delay to
do any other act which might in any manner or to the extent vary the risk of Guarantor or which
would otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law, and Guarantor hereby
waives (x)&nbsp;all presentments, demands for payment to Parent, notices of protest for non-payment,
notices of default, any other notice, any proof of reliance by any holder of a Share or Preferred
Share or any Indemnified Person upon the guarantee contained in this Section&nbsp;9.12 or acceptance of
the guarantee contained herein and all other formalities; (y)&nbsp;any rights to set-off, recoupments,
claims, or counterclaims; and (z)&nbsp;any right to revoke or terminate this guarantee.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any holder
of a Share or Preferred Share or any Indemnified Person may have at law or in equity against
Guarantor by virtue of the guarantee contained in this Section&nbsp;9.12, upon failure of Parent to make
any payment pursuant to any Obligations, when and as the same shall become due whether at Closing,
under any provision contained in this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise,
Guarantor shall pay such Obligation.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section&nbsp;9.12, Guarantor shall
have the right to assert as a defense to any of its obligations hereunder any defense or exercise
of rights that would be available to it had it entered into the Obligations directly in the place
of Parent.
