 (a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share and Preferred Share that is held by the Company as treasury stock or that is owned by Parent or any of its or the Companys respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.    

 (c) _Conversion of Shares and Preferred Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all such Shares and Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares or Preferred Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, respectively, with respect to each such Share or Preferred Share, subject to any applicable withholding tax specified in Section 2.03(e).      ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 2.02. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares and Preferred Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL.

If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares and Preferred Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration with respect to each such Share or Preferred Share, subject to any applicable withholding tax specified in Section 2.03(e). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares or Preferred Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

 SECTION 2.03. _Exchange of Certificates_.    

 (a) _Paying Agent_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than 20 days before the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, no later than the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.    

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than 15 days before the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make available upon request a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender upon or after the Effective Time of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration with respect to each Share or Preferred Share formerly represented by such Certificate. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate, who has not previously submitted a duly executed letter of transmittal, such form of letter of transmittal and instructions. If a holder surrenders to the     ##### 

  

     

Paying Agent a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed, at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date and such
holder is the record holder, as of the Closing Date, then the holder of such
Certificate shall be paid on the Closing Date in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to: (i) in the case of Certificates for Shares, the product of
the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified
in Section 2.03(e)), or (ii) in the case of Certificates for Preferred
Shares, the product of the number of Preferred Shares represented by such
Certificate multiplied by the Preferred Merger Consideration (subject to any
applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.03(e)), and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. If a holder surrenders to the
Paying Agent a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed, any time after two Business Days prior the Closing Date, and such
holder is the record holder, as of the Closing Date, then the holder of
such Certificate shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and such Certificate
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.    

 (c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares or Preferred Shares formerly represented thereby.    

 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.    

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and Preferred Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Preferred Shares such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Preferred Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.    

 (f) _No Further Ownership Rights; Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II     ##### 

  

     

shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares or Preferred Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and no further registration of transfers of Shares or
Preferred Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.    

 (g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent in direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.    

 (h) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with Section 2.02 prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, without any interest thereon. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.    

 SECTION 2.04. _Company Stock Options_.    

 (a) Parent and the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under the Companys 1999 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1999 Incentive Plan"), and the Companys 1993 Option Plan, as amended (the "1993 Option Plan," and together with the 1999 Incentive Plan, the "Stock Option Plans") that is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (each, a "Company Stock Option"), will be cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to promptly receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each Share then subject to such Company Stock Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price for such Share under such Company Stock Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration"), subject to applicable income and employment tax withholding amounts required to be withheld by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any applicable Law.    

 (b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Stock Option Plans or pursuant to the terms of any Company Stock Option granted thereunder, the Company     ##### 

  

     

shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of
outstanding Company Stock Options to the foregoing treatment of such Company
Stock Options.    

 SECTION 2.05. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions with respect to the Companys 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the "Employee Stock Purchase Plan"), as may be necessary or appropriate (i) to preclude the commencement of any new accumulation period as defined or described thereunder, from or after the Effective Time, and (ii) to terminate any current accumulation period no later than the last payroll date immediately preceding the Effective Time and shall cause all funds then accumulated in participants accounts as of the date the options have been terminated to be returned to participants as soon as administratively feasible. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as may be necessary or appropriate so that the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and any and all rights under any provisions thereof shall terminate as of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the Company or any other Person.

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary proxy statement and any amendments or supplements thereto relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement"). The Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company at the earliest practicable date. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent, as promptly as practicable, shall furnish all information concerning such party to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Company agrees that none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the information supplied by it in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

The notice of such Company Stockholder Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall submit such resolution to a vote of the stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or not the Board of Directors shall determine after the execution of this Agreement that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are no longer advisable and effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to Section 6.02, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend adoption by the Companys stockholders of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 6.02. _Acquisition Proposals_.   

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any of its and their officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, representatives and agents (collectively, "Company Representatives") to, immediately cease    ##### 

  

 

and cause to be terminated immediately all existing activities, discussions
and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company with respect thereto be returned to
the Company or destroyed. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
termination hereof and except as permitted by the following provisions, the
Company shall not, and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not to (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6.02(a)) or (iii) other than informing Persons of the existence
of the provisions contained in this Section 6.02, participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person
(other than a party to this Agreement) any non-public information with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or furnish any Person with
access to the properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote,
in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
standing (including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC), constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition
Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.02, the Company may, (i) furnish information with respect to
the Company and Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such information
has previously been, or is, in substance, provided to Parent
contemporaneously as it is provided to such Person, and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
and its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, representatives and agents regarding such Acquisition
Proposal.    

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal from any Person to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company then outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing (including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; and (ii) "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal or offer from any Person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of    ##### 

  

 

beneficial ownership of equity securities of the Company representing 20% or
more of the combined voting power of the Company, (C) any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning equity securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the
combined voting power of the Company, or (D) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.    

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement (the "Company Recommendation"), the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than one or more of the confidentiality agreements referred to in Section 6.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, before obtaining the Required Company Vote, (x) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, (y) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing (including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC), that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) the Company provides written notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has made the determination described in clause (y) above, then the Board of Directors of the Company may take either or both of the following actions: (A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.03(b), approve and enter into an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal. No Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or other state Law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (d) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two Business Days) advise Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Any such notice shall be made in writing, shall indicate the terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved, and shall include a copy of any such written inquiry, request, proposal or offer. The Company shall inform Parent and Merger Sub promptly and on an ongoing basis of the status and terms of any discussions regarding, or relating to, any such Acquisition Proposal,    ##### 

  

 

inquiry or request and, as promptly as practicable, of any change in the
price, structure of form of the consideration or material terms of and
conditions regarding any such Acquisition Proposal.    

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any successor or comparable Law) or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing (including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC), failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties or any other obligations under applicable Law.   

 SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 SECTION 6.04. _Certain Filings_. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly make any required submissions under the HSR Act which the Company or Parent determines should be made, in each case, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other Laws or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the Companys business in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers. Parent and the Company shall take or undertake all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or jurisdiction (each, a "Government Antitrust Entity") may assert under relevant antitrust, or competition Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, either Parent or the Company to proffer to, or agree to, sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or any interest in any assets or businesses, of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any offer, sale, disposition, holding or agreement to sell or dispose). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other informed of any material communication and provide to the other copies of all correspondence, between it (or its advisors) and any Government Antitrust Entity relating to this Agreement or any of the matters described in this Section 6.04, and each of the Company and Parent shall permit the other to review any material communication to be given by it to, and shall consult with each other in advance of any telephonic calls, meetings or conferences with, any Government Antitrust Entity and, to the    ##### 

  

 

extent permitted, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such telephonic calls, meetings or conferences with, any
Government Antitrust Entity.    

 SECTION 6.05. _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time each of Parent and the Company shall consult with one another before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the other partys prior approval, except as may be required by applicable Law or by the applicable regulations of any relevant stock exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.   

 SECTION 6.06. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.   

 (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification for liabilities, and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six years from the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, all such rights, liabilities and limitations in respect of any such Claim shall continue until disposition thereof; provided further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any such agreement, as the case may be, for purposes of the allowance of indemnification or advancement of expenses, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to Parent.   

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee or agent (an "Indemnified Person") of the Company or any Company Subsidiary against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") to the extent that any such Claim is based on, or arises out of: (i) the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof which is set forth in Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including provisions relating to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such Claim. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the    ##### 

  

 

event that any Claim is asserted against any Indemnified Person after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
periodically advance to such Indemnified Person its legal and other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred
in connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person
of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the case of a final
nonappealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified therefor.    

 (c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy ("DandO Insurance") for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage (including pursuant to Parents own policy) and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further that, subject to the preceding proviso, if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is canceled during such period, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance; and provided further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an annual premium for DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof, but in such case, shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.06(c) to the contrary, Parent may fulfill its (and Surviving Corporations) obligations under this Section 6.06(c) by purchasing a DandO Insurance "tail" policy under the Companys existing DandO Insurance, in either case which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently covered by the Companys DandO Insurance in effect as of the date hereof and only for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those terms in the Companys DandO Insurance on the date hereof.   

 (d) The obligations under this Section 6.06 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (c) above (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.06(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each Indemnified Person or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (c) above (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.06, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.06(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 6.06 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).   

 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its     ##### 

 

    

properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this Section
6.06.    

 SECTION 6.07. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall, upon obtaining knowledge of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall, upon obtaining knowledge of the following, give prompt notice to the Company, of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person of which the Company has knowledge alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any notice or communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) any action, suit, charge, complaint, grievance or proceeding commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.08 or which relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.    

 SECTION 6.08. _Employee Matters_.    

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with their terms all collective bargaining agreements as set forth in Section 3.07(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any existing supplemental pension arrangements, deferred compensation plans, agreements and arrangements, existing severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements and existing employment, incentive, retention, severance and change of control agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries specified in Section 3.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume expressly and agree to perform each agreement with an individual specified in Section 3.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if the Merger had not taken place.    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time and until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide to each individual who is employed by any such entity at the Effective Time with (i) an annual salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable to such individual than the salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunities provided to such individual by the Company or Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) continuation of coverage under the Companys tax qualified and welfare benefit plans or arrangements, or alternatively, comparable benefits under a different plan or plans;  _provided_ , in either case, that the individual be provided with benefits that are no less favorable to the individual in the aggregate than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) all other compensation and benefit plans no less favorable, in the     ##### 

  

     

aggregate, than those currently provided by the Company and Company
Subsidiaries or, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, excluding any equity-based
plans, programs or arrangements.    

 (c) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for all purposes, including vesting, participation, eligibility, benefit accrual and benefit determination purposes under employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plan for those purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be credited for benefit accrual purposes to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits, and shall not be required to be credited for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan of Parent or for purposes of providing post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits under any plan of Parent. Employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation and waiting periods under any health plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, give such employees credit under such plans for co-payments made, and deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements satisfied prior to the Effective Time.    

 (d) To the extent practicable, the Company and Company Subsidiaries will consult with Parent with respect to any communication intended to be broadly circulated to any of their respective employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and, in any event, shall promptly provide Parent with a copy of any such written or electronic communication.    

 (e) The parties agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a change in control for all purposes of all Company Plans. The parties further agree that for purposes of this Section 6.08(e), the term "change in control" shall include all equivalent terms as required by context (by way of illustration and not limitation, "Change of Control").    

 SECTION 6.09. _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger, each of Parent and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any takeover statute on the Merger.    

 SECTION 6.10. _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate and consult with one another in connection with any stockholder litigation against any of them or any of their respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner contemplated by the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that it will not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors     ##### 

  

     

and officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) without Parents prior written consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 (b) Parent shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements contained herein required to be performed or complied with by it prior to or at the time of the Closing, except where the failure to so perform or comply, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VIII    

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER    

 SECTION 8.01. _Termination by Mutual Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the Required Company Vote, by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.    

 SECTION 8.02. _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the Required Company Vote, by written notice of either Parent or the Company if:    

 (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by December 31, 2005 (the "Outside Date");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.01(b) or 7.01(c) shall not have been fulfilled (and Section 8.02(c) is not applicable), but all of the other conditions to the Closing have been fulfilled or are capable of being fulfilled, and either Parent or the Company determines that additional time is necessary in connection with obtaining any consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity, the Outside Date may be extended by Parent or the Company from time to time by written notice to the other party to a date not beyond March 31, 2006 if it in good faith believes such consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization can be obtained by such date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.02(a) until five (5) Business Days after the Company Stockholder Meeting occurs if the condition to the Closing set forth in Section 7.01(a) shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date due to the Companys delay of the Company Stockholder Meeting beyond the Outside Date pursuant to Section 6.01(c), but all of the other conditions to the Closing have been fulfilled or are capable of being fulfilled (and Sections 8.02(b), 8.02(c) and 8.02(d) are not applicable);     ##### 

  

     

 (b) upon a vote duly taken at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) the Required Company Vote shall not have been obtained;    

 (c) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.02(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest and remove such order, decree, ruling or action and shall not be in violation of Section 6.03 or 6.04; or    

 (d) any Governmental Entity shall have failed to issue an order, decree or ruling or to take any other action that is necessary to fulfill the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b), as applicable, and such denial of a request to issue such order, decree, ruling or take such other action shall have become final and non-appealable;    

 _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.02 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated.    

 SECTION 8.03. _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors of the Company if:    

 (a) there is a breach by Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b), which has not been cured (or is not capable of being cured) within 30 days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach; or    

 (b) prior to the approval of the Merger by the Required Company Vote, the Board of Directors of the Company has provided written notice to Parent that the Company intends to enter into a binding written agreement for a Superior Proposal (with such termination becoming effective upon the Company entering into such binding written agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not have materially breached Section 6.02; (ii) the Company shall have (A) notified Parent in writing of its receipt of such Superior Proposal, (B) further notified Parent in writing that the Company intends to enter into a binding agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and (C) attached the most current written version of such Superior Proposal (or a summary containing all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal) to such notice referred to in clause (B); (iii) provided Parent with an opportunity for a period of five (5) Business Days following delivery of the notice referred to in clause (B) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby will be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal set forth in such notice, and provided Parent with access to Company personnel for the purpose of discussing such adjustments; (iv) Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys written notice pursuant to clause (ii)(B) above, an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have reasonably concluded in good        ##### 

  

     

faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized standing (including Wachovia Capital Markets,
LLC), is as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal; and (v) the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.06(c).    

 SECTION 8.04. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent if there is a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), which has not been cured (or is not capable of being cured) within 30 days following receipt by the Company from Parent of written notice of such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with a breach of the representation contained in Section 3.02 (Capitalization) that would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.02(b), an offer by the Company to amend this Agreement to provide for a corresponding decrease in the aggregate Merger Consideration and Preferred Merger Consideration to offset the amount of Parents losses resulting from such breach would satisfy as cure for such breach (unless such losses exceed $5,000,000) and, if made, would not give Parent the right to terminate this Agreement or abandon the Merger (unless such losses exceed $5,000,000, in which case Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger pursuant to this Section 8.04).    

 SECTION 8.05. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement, except for the provisions of this Section 8.05 and 5.02(c), 8.06 and Article IX (each of which shall survive any such termination), shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or stockholders. Nothing in this Section 8.05 shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.    

 SECTION 8.06. _Fees and Expenses_.    

 (a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein (including the last sentence of Section 8.05), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.    

 (b) If (i) an Acquisition Proposal, or any intention (whether or not conditional) on the part of any Person with respect to any potential or future Acquisition Proposal, shall have been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and not withdrawn, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.02(b), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Expenses. If in addition to the foregoing, within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (with references in the definition thereof to "20%" deemed to be references to "50.1%"), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee _minus_ the amount of any Termination Expenses paid. Payment under this Section 8.06(b) shall be made in immediately available funds by wire-transfer to an account designated by Parent, (i) with respect to Termination Expenses, within two Business Days after such termination, and (ii) with respect to the Termination Fee, on or prior to the     ##### 

  

     

earlier of the date on which the agreement with respect to the Acquisition
Proposal is executed and the date on which the Acquisition Proposal is
consummated.    

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(b), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee in immediately available funds by wire-transfer to an account designated by Parent, on or prior to the earlier of the date on which the agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal is executed and the date on which the Acquisition Proposal is consummated.    

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.04 (solely for a material breach of Section 6.02), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee in immediately available funds by wire-transfer to an account designated by Parent, within two Business Days after such termination.    

 (e) If (i) an Acquisition Proposal, or any intention (whether or not conditional) on the part of any Person with respect to any potential or future Acquisition Proposal, shall have been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and not withdrawn, (ii) the breach by the Company of any covenant that is the basis for termination under 8.04 was willful on the part of the Company, and (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.04 for willful breach by the Company of any covenant (other than as a result of a breach of Section 6.02), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Expenses. If in addition to the foregoing, within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (with references in the definition thereof to "20%" deemed to be references to "50.1%"), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee  _minus_ the amount of any Termination Expenses paid. Payment under this Section 8.06(e) shall be made in immediately available funds by wire-transfer to an account designated by Parent, (i) with respect to Termination Expenses, within two Business Days after such termination and (ii) with respect to the Termination Fee, on or prior to the earlier of the date on which the agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal is executed and the date on which the Acquisition Proposal is consummated.    

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Termination Fee" means an amount equal to $14,350,000, and (ii) "Termination Expenses" means an amount, not to exceed $3,000,000, equal to the documented, out-of-pocket expenses of Parent and Merger Sub, including fees and expenses of financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts and consultants, incurred in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

 SECTION 8.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the Required Company Vote but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of the Companys stockholders under applicable Law without such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.     ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 8.08. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto (for these purposes, Parent and Merger Sub shall together be deemed one party and the Company shall be deemed the other party) may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.    

ARTICLE IX

whatsoever Parent shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay
any Obligation, Guarantor shall unconditionally pay the Obligation. Nothing
shall discharge or satisfy the liability of Guarantor under the guarantee
contained in this Section 9.12 except the full payment of the Obligations.
The guarantee contained in this Section 9.12 constitutes a guarantee of
payment when due and not of collection.    

 (b) Subject to Section 9.12(d), the obligations of Guarantor under this Section 9.12 shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 9.12 shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by, (i) the failure of any holder of a Share or Preferred Share or any Indemnified Person to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under this Section 9.12; (ii) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment of all or any part of any Obligation; or (iii) any other act or omission or delay to do any other act which might in any manner or to the extent vary the risk of Guarantor or which would otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law, and Guarantor hereby waives (x) all presentments, demands for payment to Parent, notices of protest for non-payment, notices of default, any other notice, any proof of reliance by any holder of a Share or Preferred Share or any Indemnified Person upon the guarantee contained in this Section 9.12 or acceptance of the guarantee contained herein and all other formalities; (y) any rights to set-off, recoupments, claims, or counterclaims; and (z) any right to revoke or terminate this guarantee.    

 (c) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any holder of a Share or Preferred Share or any Indemnified Person may have at law or in equity against Guarantor by virtue of the guarantee contained in this Section 9.12, upon failure of Parent to make any payment pursuant to any Obligations, when and as the same shall become due whether at Closing, under any provision contained in this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise, Guarantor shall pay such Obligation.    

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 9.12, Guarantor shall have the right to assert as a defense to any of its obligations hereunder any defense or exercise of rights that would be available to it had it entered into the Obligations directly in the place of Parent.     #####
