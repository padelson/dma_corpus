2018 pursuant to the terms of the agreements in which such shares were
granted. For purposes of the foregoing clause (c), the number of such shares
that will vest by June 22, 2018 shall be calculated on the assumption that any
holder of such shares as of the Closing Date will continue to be employed by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or serve as a director of Buyer, as
applicable, on June 22, 2018. Further, for purposes of the foregoing clause
(c), shares that vest based on the performance of Buyer for the three-year
period ended December 31, 2017, will be derived from Buyers
audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and
2017 (or, if the calculation is made prior to the finalization of Buyers 2017
audited financial statements, based on Buyers good faith estimate of its
fiscal year 2017 performance). For the avoidance of doubt, no shares granted
under Buyers performance stock plan for the three-year periods ending each of
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 or any later periods will be taken
into consideration in such determination. An illustrative example calculation
of Buyers outstanding shares of Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis as
determined based on the assumptions set forth above is set forth as _Exhibit
A_ hereto.

10 (ii) The Seller shall have a period of 30 days after the date it

of the Sellers disagreement with any item contained in the Closing Statement,
which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, including each line item and amount for which there is a
disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If a Dispute Notice is not delivered by
the Seller to Buyer within such 30-day period, then the Closing
Statement delivered by Buyer to the Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.04(b)(i)_ and the amounts set forth therein shall be final and binding and
the Closing Statement shall be deemed the " _Final Closing Statement_ ".
Any amount(s) not in dispute on the date such Dispute Notice is given shall
be treated as final and binding. During the 30 days following Buyers receipt
of a Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the Dispute Notice, and upon such resolution, the Final Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of Buyer and the Seller.

 

(iii) If Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve the disputed items set
forth in the Dispute Notice within 30 days following Buyers receipt of such
Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Buyer and the Seller may mutually
agree in writing), subject to this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(iii)_, such
disputed items shall be submitted to, and shall be resolved by, an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Buyer and the Seller. The accounting firm so agreed to by Buyer and the Seller
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Independent Accountant_ ". Buyer and the
Seller shall submit to the Independent Accountant for review and resolution
all matters (but only such matters) that are set forth in the Dispute Notice
which remain in dispute. Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the
Independent Accountant to select one of its partners experienced in purchase
price adjustment disputes (including the items in dispute) to make a final
determination of the Adjustment Items, each calculated with reference to the
items that are in dispute as set forth in the Dispute Notice. Buyer and the
Seller shall instruct the Independent Accountant that, in resolving the items
in the Dispute Notice that are still in dispute and in determining the
Adjustment Items, the Independent Accountant shall (i) not assign to any item
in dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Buyer in the Closing Statement, on the one hand, or the Seller in
the Dispute Notice, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value
for such item assigned by Buyer in the Closing Statement, on the one hand, or
the Seller, on the other hand in the Dispute Notice, (ii) make its
determination based on an independent review but only as an arbiter
(which will be in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement) and, at the Independent Accountants discretion, a one-day
conference concerning the dispute, at which conference each of Buyer and the
Seller shall have the right to present their respective positions with respect
to the dispute and have present their respective advisors, counsel and
accountants, (iii) render a final resolution in writing to Buyer and
the Seller (which final resolution shall not be based on any purchase account
or other adjustments arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall be requested by Buyer and the Seller
to be delivered not more than 45 days following submission of such disputed
matters to the Independent Accountant), which, absent manifest error, shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties with respect to the Adjustment
Items and (iv) provide a written report to Buyer and the Seller, if requested
by either of them, which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
Independent Accountants final determination. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of
the disputes not awarded to each of Buyer and

 



11  the Seller bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For
example, if the Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000
greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Independent Accountant
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Seller $300 of the $1,000
contested, then the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be
allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to the
Seller.

(iv) The Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the Parties or
at the direction of the Independent Accountant, as applicable) shall be
deemed the Final Closing Statement for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _
3.04_ upon the earliest of the (i) failure of the Seller to notify Buyer of a
dispute within 30 days after the Seller receives the Closing Statement, (ii)
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(ii)_, by Buyer
and the Seller, and (iii) resolution of all disputes, pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 3.04(b)(iii)_, by the Independent Accountant.

(v) Within five Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(iv)_:

 

(1) if the Estimated Closing Cash Payment is greater than the final Closing
Cash Payment as determined based on the final determination of the Adjustment
Items pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(iv)_ (the " _Final Closing Cash
Payment_ "), then (A) Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to,
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, pay to Buyer out of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund an amount equal to such excess and (B) (i) if such
excess is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Seller shall pay to
Buyer such difference and (ii) if such excess is not greater than the
Adjustment Escrow Fund, Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, release any funds remaining
in the Adjustment Escrow Fund following the payment to Buyer described in
clause (A) (if applicable) in accordance herewith and in the Escrow Agreement
to the Seller; and

 

(2) if the Final Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing
Cash Payment, (A) Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount equal to the difference
between the Final Closing Cash Payment and the Estimated Closing Cash Payment
to the Seller and (B) thereafter, Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, release all
funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Seller.

(vi) Upon the making of all applicable payments in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(v)_, none of the Parties may make or assert any claim
under this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ (except in the case of fraud) in connection
with the matters contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_).

(vii) All payments required under this  _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ shall be
made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
account(s) as shall be designated in writing by the recipient(s) at least two
Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

(viii) The Company, the Seller and Buyer agree to treat any payment made
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ as an adjustment to the Cash
Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



12 (ix) During the period of time from and after the Sellers receipt of the
Closing Statement through the final determination of the Final Closing Cash
Payment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Group Companies to, (i) permit the Seller and its Representatives
to consult with the Group Companies and the Companys accountants and (ii)
provide to the Seller and its Representatives reasonable access during
reasonable hours and under reasonable circumstances to all the
properties, books, contracts and records of the Group Companies and such
personnel and representatives relevant to the review of the Closing Statement
and Buyers determination of the Final Closing Cash Payment or any component
thereof in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ (including those of
Buyer Surviving LLCs accountants subject to the execution of appropriate
agreements with Buyer Survivor LLCs accountants and at the Sellers sole
expense), in each case as reasonably requested by the Seller.

3.05 _Preparation of Statements delivered by the Company pursuant
to Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)(i) and the Closing Statement_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, statements delivered by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)(i)_ and the Closing Statement (and all
calculations of Working Capital, Company Funded Debt, Company Cash and the
Transaction Expenses, other than the Tax Deficit) shall be prepared and
calculated (i) in accordance with the accounting methodologies, principles,

(b) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ shall be deemed to

or provide them any rights or remedies, (ii) confer upon any employee of the

to, (i) cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person
that would be prohibited by this _ Section_ __ _ 7.08(b)_; and (ii) not,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the

through one or more of their Representatives, (A) participate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making the

efforts (i) to

 



50  negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, including, as
necessary, the "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters (or
on terms no less favorable to Buyer (in the reasonable judgment of Buyer) than
the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter), so that such
agreements are in effect no later than the Closing Date, (ii) to satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in such definitive agreements
within its control, (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter, (iv) upon satisfaction of all conditions set forth in

modification, waiver or remedy could reasonably be expected to impact, delay
or otherwise adversely affect the ability of Buyer, Merger Sub and Buyer
Survivor LLC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger), (B) if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy adversely

Seller). In addition, Buyer shall not consent to the termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter in any respect, except for replacements of a
Debt Commitment Letter with an Alternative Financing as contemplated by

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall
promptly (but, in any event, within two (2) days of such occurrence) notify
the Seller and use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain
(x) alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") from the
same or alternative debt sources on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no
less favorable (in the reasonable judgment of Buyer) to Buyer than those in
the Debt Financing Letter and in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and with funding conditions no less favorable
to Buyer than the original Debt Commitment Letter and (y) one or more new
financing commitment letters and related fee letters.

Commitment Letter and Debt Fee Letters, or (ii) agree to any material term
that is outside of, or materially less favorable than, any applicable economic

flex provisions included therein). Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Seller
true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Buyer with any portion
of the Debt Financing, together with the related alternative debt fee letter
(which fee letter may be redacted solely to redact fee amounts and other

related to any of the circumstances as set forth in such written notice as

preparation of customary confidential information or placement
memoranda, ratings agency presentations, other lender presentations or other
offering materials related to the syndication of Debt Financing (including
assistance with pro forma financial information), in each case as customary
for a financing of a type similar to the Debt Financing and to the extent

shall be required to give representations, warranties or indemnities in such
letter); (ii) to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause senior
management of the Company to, upon reasonable advance notice by Buyer,
participate in a reasonable number meetings and presentations with ratings

ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. The Company hereby consents to the
use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Group Companies or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Seller, its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall be required to (1) pay any commitment or other similar

indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing (other than indemnities from
the Group Companies that are not effective prior to the Closing), (3) provide
any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted (but
only 

 



52  to the extent of such restrictions) under applicable Law or any written
agreements or memoranda that are subject to legal privilege, (4) take any
action that will conflict with or violate any applicable Laws or (5) take any
action to the extent that it would, in the Sellers reasonable, good faith
judgment, (x) unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Seller or its Affiliates, (y) violate any applicable Law or (z) be reasonably
likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, the
unauthorized disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or the breach of
any applicable confidentiality obligations; provided, further, (A) no
director, officer, employee or other Representative of the Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver any certificate or opinion or take
any other action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.09_ other than directors,

directors (or other applicable authorizing bodies) of the Group Companies
prior to the Closing shall not be required to approve any Debt Financing or
definitive documents related thereto prior to the Closing.

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by it and the other Subsidiaries
of the Seller in complying with their respective covenants pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.09_. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the

incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing (including providing the support and cooperation
contemplated by this Agreement) or any information provided in connection
therewith, in each case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the common law fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of, or breach of this Agreement by, any of the Seller and its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives (as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction).

53 7.13 _Proxy_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event more

the approval of the holders of shares of Buyer Common Stock (the " _Buyer
Stockholders_ ") of the Required Approval Matters (as defined below), all in
accordance with and as required by Buyers applicable Organizational

Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement without first providing the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such written communication, and each
Party will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.
Each of the Company, Buyer and the Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Prior to filing with the SEC or mailing to the Buyer Stockholders,
Buyer will make available to the Company and the Seller drafts of the Proxy

(d) If at any time following the filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement
and prior to the Buyer Stockholder Meeting there shall be discovered any
information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Buyer shall promptly transmit to its stockholders an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement containing such information. If, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the Seller discover any
information, event or circumstance relating to the Company, the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors or employees that should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
the Company and the Seller, as applicable, shall promptly inform Buyer of such
information, event or circumstance.

efforts to promptly provide Buyer with all information concerning the Company

Statement and any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement (if any) and
in any other filing required to be made by Buyer with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
applicable "blue sky" laws and any rules and regulations thereunder. The
Company and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the officers and employees of the Company to be reasonably available to Buyer
and its counsel in connection with the drafting of the Proxy Statement and
such other filings and responding in a timely manner to comments relating to
the Proxy Statement from the SEC.

7.14 _Buyer Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, establish a record date (which
date shall be mutually agreed with the Company) for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, which meeting shall be
held not more than 45 days after the date on which Buyer mails the Proxy
Statement to the Buyer Stockholders. Without limiting Buyers rights set
forth in, and subject to, _Section_ __ _ 7.14(b)_, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the Required
Approval Matters, including by soliciting proxies as promptly as practicable
in accordance with applicable Law and Buyers Organizational Documents for the
purpose of approving the Required Approval Matters.

 



55 (b) Subject to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14(b)_, (i) Buyer shall, through the
Buyer Board, recommend to the Buyer Stockholders that they vote in favor of
the Required Approval Matters (the " _Buyer Board Recommendation_ ") and Buyer
shall include the Buyer Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii)
the Buyer Board shall not (A) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify,
or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the
Buyer Board Recommendation; (B) adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Buyer Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after
the Seller so requests in writing, which request is transmitted after
any public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal (provided that Buyer will
have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two occasions); (D)
take any Buyer Board action or make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation
against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Buyer
Board to the Buyer Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Buyer Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from
taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of
business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of a tender
or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such
action being considered a violation of this _Section 7.14_ ); or (E) fail to
include the Buyer Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action
described in clauses (A) through (E), a " _Change in Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.14_, at any time prior to the receipt of approval of the Required Approval
Matters, the Buyer Board may effect, or cause the Buyer to effect, as
applicable, a Change in Recommendation if: 

(i) a material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises
after the date hereof that was not known by Buyer as of the execution of this
Agreement and was not reasonably foreseeable to Buyer as of the execution of
this Agreement (such development or change in circumstance, an " _Intervening
Event_ ") and the Buyer Board determines in good faith, following
consultation with outside legal counsel that, as a result of such Intervening
Event, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Buyer Boards exercise of its fiduciary
obligations to the Buyer Stockholders under applicable Law; or

(ii) after the date of this Agreement, Buyer receives an Acquisition
Proposal and the Buyer Board determines in good faith, following consultation
with outside legal counsel that, in connection with receipt of such offer to
effect an Acquisition Transaction, that a failure to effect a Change in
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Buyer
Boards exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the Buyer Stockholders under
applicable Law;

 

 _provided_ , that the Buyer Board shall not effect a Change in Recommendation
unless the Buyer Board shall have (i) provided the Seller with five (5)
Business Days notice of its intent to make such Change in Recommendation,
(ii) during such five (5) Business Day period, the Buyer Board has considered
and, at the reasonable request of the Seller, engaged in good faith 

 



56  discussions with the Seller regarding, any adjustment or modification to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Seller, and (iii) the Buyer Board,
following such five (5) Business Day period, again reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and taking into
account any adjustment or modification to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by the Seller, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Buyer Boards exercise of its fiduciary duties to the
Buyer Stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Buyer Stockholder Meeting
to the extent reasonably necessary (i) to ensure that any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Buyer Board has determined in good
faith is required by applicable Law is disclosed to the Buyer Stockholders
and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to the Buyer
Stockholders prior to the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, (ii) if, as of the time
for which the Buyer Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business to be conducted at the Buyer Stockholder Meeting,
or (iii) by up to ten Business Days in the aggregate in order to solicit
additional proxies from stockholders in favor of the adoption of the Required
Approval Matters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Buyer
shall not be obligated to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene or hold the Buyer Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of voting on
the Required Approval Matters in the event the Buyer Board issues a Change in
Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement.

7.15 _R andW Insurance Cooperation_. The Seller and the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) in obtaining the RandW
Insurance, including by providing reasonable access to the records,
properties, personnel of the Group Companies, and by furnishing Buyer and the
RandW Insurance provider as promptly as reasonably practicable with information
and documentation customarily required for such transaction representations
and warranties insurance policy (including by providing access to the
documents or other material contained in the, or copies of portions of or the
entire, virtual data room established by or on behalf of the Company by
Merrill Corporation in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to execution of customary confidentiality agreements). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Seller and the Company shall not be required to provide
such assistance to the extent it reasonably determines in good faith that
such assistance may unreasonably disrupt or impair the business or operations
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall
require the Seller or the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
disclose information to the extent such disclosure (A) would result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege, or (B) would violate any applicable Law or any contractual
confidentiality obligation of such party.

 

7.16 _Taylor GP_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Taylor GP shall
withdraw as the manager of each Group Company to which it is a manager, and,
effective upon the Effective Time, Buyer or its designee shall be designated
as manager pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements of
such Group Companies.

 



57 7.17 _Takeover Laws_. The Parties shall (a) use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law, including, but not
limited to, Section 203 of the DGCL, is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)
if any state takeover Law, including, but not limited to, Section 203 of the
DGCL, becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.18 _Appointments_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
each of Michael Schnabel and Bruce Pollack to be appointed to the Buyer
Board, in each case, effective as of the Closing Date.

7.19 _Seller Efforts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (a) the Seller shall cause the Group Companies to do all things
required to be done or to deliver all items required to be delivered by any of
the Group Companies pursuant to this Agreement and (b) the Seller (i) shall
not permit, and shall cause not to be permitted any equity securities of the
Seller to be directly transferred during the period from the date of the
execution of this Agreement through the Closing Date other than to Affiliates
of the Seller or (ii) provide written notice to Buyer promptly upon becoming
aware of any indirect transfer of any equity securities of the Seller during
the period from the date of the execution of this Agreement through the
Closing Date.

7.20 _Intellectual Property_. Prior to the Closing Date, each of the
Seller and the Group Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) make all filings necessary to permit the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or
agency (" _Applicable IP Office_ ") in any relevant jurisdiction to update
its official records to reflect that the correct Group Company is accurately
listed as the record title owner of each trademark application and
registration, copyright application and registration, and patent application
and patent included in the Company Owned IP (collectively, the " _Registered
IP_ "), including all filings necessary to update the record title for any
Registered IP in the name of Springfield Acquisition Co., LLC as of the date
hereof and all filings necessary to correct the owner name for any Registered
IP registered in the name of "Chefn Corporation" rather than "The Chefn
Corporation"; and (b) make all filings necessary to permit the Applicable IP
Office in any relevant jurisdiction to update its official records to reflect
that all outstanding Liens on any Registered IP have been paid and released,
in each case ((a) and (b)) with evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

7.21 _Payoff Letters_. The Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Payoff Letters to be executed at the Closing, including the names
of each Person to which Company Funded Debt listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 10.04_
is owed, the amounts owed to such Person and the bank account or bank
accounts to which such amounts are to be paid. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Payoff Letters, at least seven
Business Days prior to the Closing.

releases, acquits and discharges each of the Group Companies and Buyer and
their respective past and present managers, officers, directors, equity
holders, partners, Affiliates, employees, agents and attorneys and the
respective successors, assigns, heirs, legal representatives, executors,
administrators and Affiliates of the foregoing, and each of them (each, a "
_Released Party_ "), from any and all claims, suits, charges, demands,
complaints, causes of action, debts, damages, obligations, promises,
judgments, agreements and liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including claims for damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys, brokers
and accountants fees and expenses), whether known or unknown and whether at
law or in equity, in each case, solely to the extent arising out of such
Releasing Partys direct or indirect ownership of equity interests of the
Company or any other Group Company (" _Releasing Party Claims_ ") arising
from or related to events, facts, conditions or circumstances existing or
arising on or prior to the Closing Date, including, any Releasing Party Claims
that the Releasing Party has or may in the future have against the Released
Parties or commencing (or causing to be commenced or assisting with) any suit,
action or proceeding of any kind, in any court, against the Released Parties
based upon any Releasing Party Claim and hereby agrees, effective upon and
conditioned upon the completion of the Closing, not to bring, assert or
threaten to bring or otherwise join, in each case directly or indirectly, in
any claim or demand against any of the Released Parties or any of them or
commence (or cause to be commenced or assist with) any suit, action or
proceeding of any kind, in any court, against the Released Parties based upon

suit, claim or proceeding released pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_

Releasing Party agrees and acknowledges that the release of any asserted or

Party understands that this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ includes a full and final
release covering all 

 



59  known and known, suspected or unsuspected injuries, debts, claims or damages

that there is a risk that, after signing this Agreement, the Releasing Party

risk and understands that this release shall apply to any such liabilities.

Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

termination or discretion applicable to any Company Benefit Plan that

ARTICLE IX

TAX COVENANTS

 

9.01 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or which include the Closing
Date, and in each case are filed after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return
with respect to any Income Tax shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, unless otherwise
required by Law. Buyer shall provide the Seller with a copy of such proposed
Tax Return with respect to any Income Tax (and such additional
information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by the
Seller) at least 45 days prior to the filing of such Tax Return (except that
in the case of a Tax Return related to Taxes due within 90 days following the
Closing Date, the copy shall be provided to the Seller within 20 days prior
to the filing), and the Seller shall provide any comments to Buyer in writing
within 10 days following the receipt of such Tax Return from Buyer. In the
event that, taking into account any reasonable comments from the Seller, a
Tax Return governed by this _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ shows that a refund would be
due, Buyer and the Seller shall use good faith efforts to resolve their
dispute, if any, regarding the appropriate treatment of the disputed item or
items. If Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the
preparation of such Tax Returns, they shall refer such dispute to the
Independent Accountant, whose determination shall be final and conclusive
on the parties, with the cost of the Independent Accountant to be borne by
Buyer and Seller in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
3.04(b)(iii)_.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement (including in the calculation of Working
Capital and the Tax Deficit), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion
of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income, gains or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Group Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any deduction attributable to Transaction
Expenses of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries shall be allocated to the
taxable period or the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



61 9.02 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements with respect to
or involving the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be terminated no
later than the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, other than with
respect to such agreements that are solely between the Group Companies, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

9.03 _Certain Post-Closing Payments and Post-Closing Actions_. If Buyer,
the Company, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries (a) receives (i) any
refund of an Income Tax for a Relevant Tax Period, or (ii) any refund
attributable to a net operating loss carryback from a Relevant Tax Period
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, not a net operating loss carryforward from a

_Section_ __ _ 13.01(c)_, by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.01(d)_ or
by Buyer or the Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.01(e)_ (unless, with
respect to _Section_ __ _ 13.01(e)_, at the time of the Buyer Stockholder
Meeting, Buyer was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 13.01(b)_), and, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, (i)
at the time of such termination, a Buyer Alternative Transaction proposal was
received by the Buyer Board or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and (ii)

Agreement is validly terminated by Buyer or the Seller pursuant to _Section_

termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount equal to the out
of pocket Transaction Expenses (if such fees are reasonably documented and
provided in detailed form in writing to Buyer) incurred up to and including
the date of termination (the " _Transaction Expense Fee_ "); _provided_ that
in no event shall Buyer be required to pay such Transaction Expense Fee in an
amount greater than $3,000,000 in the aggregate.

(h) The Parties acknowledge that (1) the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 13.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (2) Buyer,

 



68  the Company and Seller have expressly negotiated the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ XIII,_ (3) that, without these agreements, the Parties would
not enter into this Agreement, (4) in light of the circumstances existing at
the time of the execution of this Agreement (including the inability of the
Parties to quantify the damages that may be suffered by the Company), the
provisions of this _Article XIII_ are reasonable and (5) the Termination Fee
represents a good faith, fair estimate of the damages that the Seller would
suffer as a result of the termination of this Agreement and the failure of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers receipt and
acceptance of the Termination Fee and the Transaction Expense Fee (if payable)
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 13.02_, when payable, shall be (i) deemed
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
the Company or the Seller or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and (ii) the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and any other Member against Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Financing Sources for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the
Mergers to be consummated, in each case (with respect to both clause (i) and
clause (ii)) in any circumstance in which the Seller is permitted to
terminate this Agreement and cause the Seller to receive the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Sections 13.02(e)_ and _(f)_ , and upon the Companys receipt of
such amounts, none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Buyer Survivor LLC or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ that (i) for purposes of clarity, in no event
shall any Financing Source have any liability to any of the Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person for all or any portion of the
Termination Fee and (ii) each of the Company, the Seller and Buyer
shall remain liable under the Confidentiality Agreement. While the Company
may pursue both a grant of specific performance, injunction or other equitable
remedies under _Section_ __ _ 15.10_ and the payment of the Termination Fee
under this _Section_ __ _ 13.02_, under no circumstances shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
the obligation to consummate the Closing and monetary damages in connection
with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including all or
any portion of the Termination Fee. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement in any circumstance in which the Seller is not entitled to receive
the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Sections 13.02(e)_ or _(f)_ , the Seller
and the Company shall be able to pursue all rights and remedies available at
law or in equity for any loss suffered as a result of any willful and material
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the
Mergers to be consummated; _provided_ , that in no event will Buyer and its
Affiliates have any liability with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby in excess of $9,000,000 in the aggregate.
Notwithstanding anything in to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 13.02(a)_, Buyer shall be able to pursue all rights and
remedies available at law or in equity for any loss suffered as a result of
the termination of this Agreement and the failure of the Parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , that, if this Agreement is
terminated, in no event will the Seller and its Affiliates have any liability
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
in excess of $9,000,000 in the aggregate.

representatives) shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Mergers or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the foregoing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The Financing
Sources (in their capacities as such) shall not have any liability (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
Party under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection

public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

15.15 _Facsimile Signatures_. A signature page to this Agreement, the
agreements referred to herein, and each other agreement or instrument entered
into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, that contains a copy of a Partys
signature and that is sent by such Party or its agent with the apparent
intention (as reasonably evidenced by the actions of such Party or its agent)
that it constitute such Partys execution and delivery of this Agreement or
any such other document, including a document sent by means of a facsimile
machine or electronic transmission in portable document format ("pdf"), will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument
and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. Minor variations in
the form of the signature page, including

 



76  footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document,
will be disregarded in determining the Partys intent or the effectiveness of
such signature. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such agreement
or instrument, each other Party hereto or thereto will re execute original
forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No Party hereto or to any
such agreement or instrument will raise the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in pdf as a defense
to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each such Party forever
waives any such defense.
