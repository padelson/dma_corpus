Dear Sirs,

  



  

 **Recommended Cash Offer for Lastminute.com Plc**

  



  

We are writing in connection with the recommended cash offer (the " **Offer**
") for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Lastminute.com plc
(" **Lastminute.com** ") to be made by Travelocity Europe Limited (" **TEL**
"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Sabre, Inc. (" **Sabre** "). It
is currently intended that the Offer be effected by means of a scheme
of arrangement of Lastminute.com under section 425 of the _Companies Act_
1985 (the " **Scheme** "), upon the terms set out in the announcement to
be made on or about 12 May 2005 under Rule 2.5 of the UK City Code
on Takeovers and Mergers (the " **Code** ") substantially in the form set
out in Annexure A to this letter (the " **Announcement** "). We refer to your
role as TELs financial adviser in relation to the Offer for the purposes of
the Code.

  



  

 **Acknowledgements**

  



  

1. We acknowledge that:

  



  

(a) Rule 2.5(a) of the Code requires that an announcement of the Offer should
be made only when TEL has every reason to believe that it can and will
continue to be able to implement the Offer;

  



  

(b) Rule 24.7 of the Code requires that the formal document containing the
terms and conditions of the Offer (the " **Offer Document** ", which, if the
Offer is effected by means of a scheme of arrangement of Lastminute.com will
comprise a circular to Lastminute.com shareholders containing, _inter alia,_
the information required under section 426 of the _Companies Act_ 1985 and
the terms of the scheme of arrangement) must include confirmation by an
appropriate third party (e.g. Morgan Stanley and Co. Limited (" **Morgan
Stanley** ") in its capacity as TELs financial adviser) that resources are
available to TEL sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer (the "
**Cash Confirmation** ");

  

   

     
   

  



  

(c) the Offer cannot and will not be subject to a financing condition; and

  



  

(d) TEL is solely responsible for producing or procuring cash to satisfy
payment in full of the consideration due under the Offer (however effected),
including any amounts due under any proposals made under Rule 15 of the Code
and, if the Offer is effected by means of a takeover offer, any amounts due
after the implementation of the compulsory acquisition provisions of sections
428 to 430F of the Companies Act 1985 (the " **Consideration** ").

  



  

 **Purpose, reliance and disclosure**

  



  

2. We understand that, before agreeing to provide the Cash Confirmation in the Offer Document, Morgan Stanley, in its capacity as TELs financial adviser, must satisfy itself that, at the time that the Announcement is released and published, TEL can and will continue to be able to implement the Offer. The purpose of this letter is to provide Morgan Stanley with certain assurances, confirmations and undertakings in support of, and so as to enable it to give, the Cash Confirmation. In consideration of Morgan Stanley agreeing to give the Cash Confirmation (including, subject to Sabre and TEL complying with the terms of this letter, in the offer document to be issued in connection with any recommended offer effected by means of a takeover offer in accordance with clause 3.7 or clause 3.8 of the Implementation Agreement between Sabre, TEL and Lastminute.com dated on or about the date of this letter (the " **Implementation Agreement** ")), Sabre and TEL have agreed to give the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and undertakings contained in this letter.

  



  

3. We confirm that you are entitled to rely upon this letter. Other than Clifford Chance LLP, who may rely upon this letter solely in order to provide you with advice in connection with the giving of the Cash Confirmation, no other person may rely upon this letter. You may deliver a copy of this letter to your professional advisers and to any relevant regulatory authority. This letter may be disclosed in connection with any dispute or proceedings in relation to the Offer.

  



  

 **Sources of funds**

  



  

4. If the Offer is effected by means of the Scheme and if the Scheme becomes effective, the aggregate cash consideration payable to Lastminute.com shareholders under the terms of the Scheme will be the amount £585,100,000 and 103,000,000.  This amount is to be funded from Sabres existing cash resources and from the proceeds of Borrowings under the Credit Agreement referred to in sub-paragraph 5(b) below, which are to be made available (directly or indirectly) to TEL. To the extent such funds are denominated in US dollars, Sabre has entered into the Currency Option Agreements referred to in sub-paragraph 5(c) below to appropriately limit its foreign currency exposure.

  



  

5. We refer to:

  



  

(a) the amount of $450 million in cash and marketable securities (the "
**Agreed Amount** ") which, in accordance with sub-paragraph 9(g), will be
deposited in a separate account (the " **Account** ") maintained with
American Beacon Advisors on behalf of Sabre or TEL. Evidence of such deposit
or of the arrangements

  

   

     
   

  



  

made for such deposits to be made on the date of the Announcement is
contained in Annexure B;

  



  

(b) the $800,000,000 million credit agreement dated on or about the date of
this letter between Sabre (as Borrower), Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc
(as Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent) and others, a copy of which
is set out in Annexure C to this letter (the " **Credit Agreement** ").
 Unless defined in this letter or unless the context requires
otherwise, terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same meaning when
used in this letter and a reference to a " **Section** " is to a Section of
the Credit Agreement; and

  



  

(c) the currency option agreements which, pursuant to sub-paragraph 9(g), are
to be entered into on the date of this letter between Sabre (as Buyer) and
one of the Lenders or one of their respective Affiliates (as Seller) pursuant
to which Sabre has purchased an option to purchase Sterling and an option to
purchase Euros on the terms described in the term sheets set out in Annexure
D (the " **Currency Option Agreements** ").

below and (ii) as otherwise disclosed in writing to Morgan Stanley prior to
the date of this letter, neither the execution of, nor the performance of
their respective obligations under, this letter nor the making and

the requirements of the Code;

  



  

(g) so far as Sabre is aware, having made all reasonable inquiry, nothing has

undertakings given in this letter do not conflict with such terms;

funds comprising the Agreed Amounts and the Relevant Cash Deposits to TEL in

(i) so far as Sabre is aware, having made all reasonable inquiry, nothing has

(ii) in the absence of a waiver from Bank of America N.A. in the terms
described in sub-paragraph 1l(k) below, the borrowing of the Acquisition Loan
under the Credit Agreement and the implementation of the Transactions may

8. Immediately prior to the despatch of the Offer Document (the " **Relevant Time** "), Sabre will notify Morgan Stanley in writing of any fact, matter or circumstance of which it has become aware (having made reasonable inquiry) which, if the representations and warranties contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 were to be given at the Relevant Time by reference to the facts and circumstances at the Relevant Time, would render any of those

  

   

     
   

  



  

representations and warranties incorrect, inaccurate or misleading (or
provide an appropriate written negative confirmation).

  



  

 **Primary undertakings**

  



  

9. Sabre undertakes to Morgan Stanley that:

  



  

(a) at all times prior to the expiry or discharge of TELs obligations to pay
the Consideration to Lastminute.com shareholders, Sabre will maintain cash
deposits and deposits of marketable securities within the Consolidated Group
at an aggregate level (when added to the amounts standing to the credit of
the Account) equal to not less than the Agreed Amount (such cash deposits and
deposits of marketable securities together with the Agreed Amount the "
**Relevant Cash** **Deposits** ") and it will procure that no mortgage,
pledge, lien, assignment, right of set-off (other than any right of set-off
in favour of the American Beacon Advisors in the ordinary course or arising
under the terms of business applicable to the Account), or other encumbrance
or security interest exists or is granted or created over or in respect of
any of the funds or securities constituting the Relevant Cash Deposits;

  



  

(b) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will do all things required
of it under the Credit Agreement to secure the advance of the Acquisition
Loan in an amount which, when taken together with the Relevant Cash Deposits
and after taking into account the Currency Option Agreements, is sufficient
to pay the Consideration;

  



  

(c) it will (and that it will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will)
carry out such intra group transactions as are necessary to achieve transfer
of the Relevant Cash Deposits and the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit
Agreement to TEL to the extent necessary to enable it to comply with its
obligations to pay the Consideration in accordance with the terms of the
Offer and the requirements of the Code;

  



  

(d) it will notify Morgan Stanley in writing (i) prior to withdrawing any
funds from the Account and (ii) immediately on becoming aware that it has
failed to comply with any of the undertakings given in this paragraph 9;

  



  

(e) without limitation to sub-paragraph 9(a), it will procure that it and its
Subsidiaries maintain cash deposits (less any amounts then outstanding under
the Existing Facility) and deposits of marketable securities and headroom
under the Credit Agreement, in each case taking into account the Currency
Option Agreements, which are in aggregate at least equal to the amount which
is required to fund the Consideration at all times before the potential
breaches of the Existing Facility referred to in sub-paragraph 6(o) are
waived or otherwise cured (so that, until the potential breaches of the
Existing Facility referred to in sub-paragraph 6(o) are waived or otherwise
cured, the amount of the cash deposits and deposits of marketable securities
as described in sub-paragraph 9(a) above and headroom under the Credit
Agreement

  

   

     
   

  



  

maintained by Sabre and its Subsidiaries will be increased by the amount
corresponding to any amounts then outstanding under the Existing Facility);
and

  



  

(f) if at the time the Currency Option Agreements expire (i) the Offer has
not lapsed or been withdrawn and (ii) TEL has not paid all of the
Consideration due to Lastminute.com shareholders, then Sabre will, if
requested to do so by Morgan Stanley (acting reasonably), promptly put in
place arrangements satisfactory to Morgan Stanley (acting reasonably) so as
to appropriately limit its foreign currency exposure in respect of the
outstanding Consideration; and

  



  

(g) it will deposit the Agreed Amount in the Account in accordance with the
arrangements described in Annexure B and enter into the Currency Option
Agreements, in each case no later than 17.00 (London time) on the date of
this letter and promptly thereafter provide Morgan Stanley with evidence in
writing of its compliance with this sub-paragraph 9(g).

  



  

10. TEL undertakes to Morgan Stanley that:

  



  

(a) without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley (which, if
alternative source(s) of finance satisfactory to Morgan Stanley (acting
reasonably) to pay the Consideration are available, shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), all of the funds provided to it by Sabre in accordance
with paragraph 9 to pay the Consideration will be used by it solely to pay
the Consideration until such time as the Consideration is paid in full; and

  



  

(b) such payment will be made within the relevant time period for payment
prescribed in Rule 31.8 of the Code,

  



  

in each case in accordance with the terms of the Offer and the requirements
of the Code.

  



  

 **Further undertakings**

  



  

11. Sabre undertakes to Morgan Stanley that:

terms on which Relevant Cash Deposits are held in a manner which would
prevent or restrict compliance with any of its obligations under paragraph 9
of this letter;

  



  

(b) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that no event
occurs which constitutes or which will or which would reasonably be expected
to constitute a Major Default;

  



  

(c) without limitation to sub-paragraph 9(b), it will procure, so far as it
is within its power to do so, that the Conditions Precedent contained in

(i) it will procure that the certificate referred to it Section 4.02(b) is
given to the Administrative Agent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
after the conditions referred to in that section have been satisfied;

  

   

     
   

  



  

(ii) if the Offer is effected by means of the Scheme, it will procure that
(i) the Court Order in respect of the Scheme is registered with the Registrar
of Companies pursuant to subsection 425(3) of the _Companies Act 1985_ and
(ii) the certificate referred to in Section 4.02(c) is delivered to the
Administrative Agent, in each case promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) after the Court Order is made;

  



  

(iii) if the Offer is not effected by means of the Scheme, it will procure
that the certificate referred to in Section 4.02(c) is delivered to the
Administrative Agent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after the
Unconditional Date occurs;

  



  

(iv) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.06,

Acquisition Loan in relation to itself and, to the extent applicable, TEL;

  



  

(v) so long as the matters deemed to be confirmed or represented and
warranted by the Loan Notice can then be confirmed or represented and
warranted (as the case may be), Sabre will procure that the Administrative
Agent shall have received a Loan Notice specifying a Borrowing in the amount
which, when taken together with the Relevant Cash Deposits and after taking
into account the Currency Option Agreements, is sufficient to pay all of the
Consideration in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement and
that such Loan Notice identifies the location and account number of the
Settlement Account; and

  



  

(vi) it will provide copies of any notice or certificate delivered or
received by it under the Credit Agreement (including the certificates
referred to in sub-paragraphs 11(c)(i), (ii) and (iii) above) to Morgan
Stanley promptly (and in any event within 3 Business Days) after giving or
receiving (as the case may be) such notice or certificate;

  



  

(d) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that no event
occurs which will or which would reasonably be expected to (i) entitle any
person to rescind, cancel, terminate or repudiate the Credit Agreement or the
Currency Option Agreements or (ii) otherwise entitle the Lenders to refuse
the use or availability of an Acquisition Loan or prevent an Acquisition Loan
being used to pay the Consideration;

  



  

(e) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that nothing
occurs which would prevent Sabre making the funds and the securities (or
their cash equivalent) constituting the Relevant Cash Deposits available to
TEL in accordance with the undertakings given in this letter to enable it to
pay the Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Offer and the
requirements of the Code;

  



  

(f) without Morgan Stanleys prior written consent, it will not enter into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding which conflicts with any of the

  

   

     
   

  



  

undertakings given in this letter provided that if such agreement,
arrangement or understanding would not result in a breach of the undertaking
in sub-paragraph 11(i) below, then Morgan Stanley shall not reasonably
withhold or delay such consent;

  



  

(g) it will not terminate or waive, vary or amend the terms of the Credit
Agreement or the Currency Option Agreements or agree to do any of the
foregoing provided that if such waiver, variation or amendment would not
result in a breach of the undertaking given in sub-paragraph 11(i)
below, then Morgan Stanley shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such
consent;

  



  

(h) without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley (which, if
alternative source(s) of finance satisfactory to Morgan Stanley to pay the
Consideration are available, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
it will not do anything and will not enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding which would prevent or restrict the funds made available under
the Finance Documents from being applied to pay the Consideration in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and the requirements of the Code;

  



  

(i) it will not do anything which will or which might reasonably be expected
to (i) prejudice or adversely affect TELs ability to satisfy its obligations
under the Offer and to pay the Consideration; (ii) prevent or delay TEL
paying the Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Offer and the
requirements of the Code; (iii) prevent Morgan Stanley providing the Cash
Confirmation; or (iv) render Morgan Stanley liable to pay some or all of the
Consideration;

  



  

(j) it will procure that TEL complies with its obligations under this letter;
and

  



  

(k) in relation to the Existing Facility:

  



  

(i) Sabre will seek a waiver from Bank of America, N.A. in respect of the
breach of the Existing Facility described in sub-paragraph 6(o) above
promptly after the Announcement is made; and

  



  

(ii) so far as it is within its power to do so, Sabre will procure that, for
so long as any amounts are drawn under the Existing Facility, no Event of
Default (as that term is defined in the Existing Facility) occurs as a result
of the borrowing of the Acquisition Loan under the Credit Agreement and the
implementation of the Transactions.

  



  

12. TEL undertakes to Morgan Stanley that:

  



  

(a) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that no event
occurs which constitutes or which will or which would reasonably be expected
to constitute a Major Default;

  



  

(b) in each case in so far as it is within its power to do so, it will

5.06, 5.07 and 5.12 shall (to the

  

   

     
   

  



  

extent applicable) be true and correct in relation to itself on and as of the
date of the Acquisition Loan;

  



  

(c) so far as it is within its power to do so, it will procure that no event
occurs which will or which would reasonably be expected (i) entitle any
person to rescind, cancel, terminate or repudiate the Credit Agreement or
(ii) otherwise entitle the Lenders to refuse the use or availability of an
Acquisition Loan or prevent an Acquisition Loan being used to pay the
Consideration;

  



  

(d) without Morgan Stanleys prior written consent, it will not enter into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding which conflicts with any of the
undertakings given in this letter provided that if such agreement,
arrangement or understanding would not result in a breach of the undertaking
given in sub-paragraph 12(e) below, then Morgan Stanley shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent; and

  



  

(e) it will not do anything which will or which might reasonably be expected
to (i) prejudice or adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations

 **The Offer Document and the Offer**

  



  

14. Other than an amendment required by the Code or the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the " **Panel** "), neither TEL nor Sabre shall make, consent to or agree any amendment to the Offer Document or the terms of the Offer without Morgan Stanleys prior written consent provided that if the amendment:

  



  

(a) would not result in a breach of any of the undertakings contained in this
letter; or

  



  

(b) would not increase the consideration payable under the Offer,

  



  

then Morgan Stanley shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to
such amendment.

  



  

15. Subject to the requirements of the Code and the Panel, nothing in this letter will prevent TEL from waiving, or require TEL to waive, or require that Sabre or TEL obtain Morgan Stanleys consent to any waiver of any condition to the Offer, provided that TEL may not waive those conditions to the Offer which are also conditions precedent to the Borrowing of Acquisition Loans under Section 4.02 without Morgan Stanleys prior written consent unless those conditions precedent have been waived by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement.
