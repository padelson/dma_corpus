iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 20,
2011, is entered into between Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Parent"), and Tower Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company"). Parent and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations."

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein in which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into Parent;

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Susquehanna Bank, a bank and trust company organized under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the
"Parent Bank"), and Graystone Tower Bank, a bank organized under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Company Bank"), will enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Bank Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company Bank shall merge
with and into the Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger), with the Parent Bank
constituting the surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank"), and it is intended
that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately following the consummation of
the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL"), at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge
with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease.

 



1 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of
merger complying with the PBCL (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
prepared, executed and delivered for filing with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Department"), in each case on the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 10.1 hereof). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are filed by the Department
or at such later time as may be specified in the Articles of Merger (such time
being the "Effective Time").

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I,
and Sections 2.2(e) and Section 9.1(g) hereof, each share of the common
stock, no par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except for
Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section
1.4(d) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and
subject to the provisions of Section 1.5, either (i) the Per Share Stock
Consideration (as defined below) or (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as
defined below). The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."

 

For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the
Exchange Ratio.

"Per Share Cash Consideration" shall mean $28.00. 

"Exchange Ratio" shall mean 3.4696.

"Total Cash Amount" shall equal Eighty Eight Million Dollars ($88,000,000).

"Determination Date" shall mean the third calendar day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a trading day on the NASDAQ
Stock Market, then the trading day immediately preceding such calendar day.

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock or owner designated by a book entry
previously representing a

 



2  non-certificated share of Company Common Stock (a "Book-Entry Share") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b) hereof, and (iii) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock Consideration. In the event
that Parent enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of Parent Common
Stock would be converted, prior to the Effective Time, into shares or
other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision
shall be made in such agreement, so that each Company shareholder shall be
entitled to receive at the Effective Time such number of shares or other
securities or amount of obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred
immediately prior to the consummation of such conversion.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock (x) held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties, including
all shares of Company Common Stock held in connection with the Companys
employee stock ownership plan (such plan and the trust related thereto, the
"ESOP") (any such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are
similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or (y)
held by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of Company Common
Stock, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly held, whether
held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, being referred to herein
as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock
of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares)
shall become treasury stock of Parent.

(e) The calculations required by Section 1.4(a) shall be prepared jointly by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing Date.

1.5 _Election Procedures_.

 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing shares
of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (as defined below)) in
such form as Parent and

 



3  the Company shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed 35
days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as the
Company and Parent shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder
of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth
business day prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").

 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock
Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common
Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration ("Cash Election Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no
election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock ("No Election
Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent
has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m., on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline")
shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."

 

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates or evidence of Book-
Entry Shares (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in
the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline and no new
Election Form is subsequently submitted prior to the Election Deadline, the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become
No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such
Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the person
submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the
holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion
to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent as to such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



4 (e) Within ten business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the
holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or
cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

(1) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash
amount that would be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash
Election Shares (such amount hereinafter, the "Section 1.5(e) Cash Amount") is
greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

 

(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, 

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(2) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process (excluding, to the extent possible, shares of Company
Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any incentive stock option at
any time within twelve months prior to the Effective Date), a sufficient
number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash
amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the
Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

 

(C) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

 



5 (3) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to
the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above shall not apply
and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined
by Parent and the Company.

 

1.6 _Option Plans; Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each unexercised stock option outstanding to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Companys 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan"), 1995 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the
"1995 Option Plan"), 2007 Stock Incentive Plan ("2007 Plan"), the Companys
Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the "Director Plan")"), the American
Home Bank, National Association 2001 Stock Option Plan (the "AHB Plan") or
the First Chester 1995 Stock Option Plan (the "FC Plan," and together with the
2010 Plan, the 1995 Option Plan, the 2007 Plan, the Director Plan and the AHB
Plan, the "Company Option Plans," and each such option being a "Company
Option"), and each Company Option Plan, shall be assumed by Parent in a
transaction described in Sections 409A or 424(a), as applicable of the Code.
Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company
Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deliver to the holders of Company Options, notices describing the conversion
of such Company Options (as modified by this Section 1.6(a)), and the
agreements evidencing the Company Options shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (as modified by this Section 1.6(a)). Parent shall
comply with the terms of all such Company Options. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock necessary to satisfy Parents obligations under this Section 1.6(a). As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement or statements on Form S-8 or Form S-3 (or any successor form) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options
assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

 



6 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to any Parent equity
securities) and dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities with respect to any Company equity securities)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), with respect to Parent or who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) Following the earlier to occur of (i) the end of the Offering Period (as
defined in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")) in effect
as of the date hereof and (ii) the Election Form Record Date, no additional
payroll deductions (or other contributions) shall be made pursuant to the
ESPP. After the date hereof, no participant (as defined in the ESPP) shall be
permitted to increase the rate of his or her payroll deduction relating to the
ESPP above the rate in effect as of the date hereof (or such lesser rate as
may be reduced by the participant following the date hereof). The rights of
participants in the ESPP with respect to any Offering Period currently
underway under the ESPP shall be determined by treating the earlier of (i) the
last business day of the current Offering Period or (ii) the last business day
prior to the Election Form Record Date, as the last day of such offering
period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to
reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall be
terminated

 

1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. Except for shares of Parent Common Stock owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and
DPC Shares), which shall be converted into treasury stock of Parent as

Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(b) The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement shall constitute

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, (i) certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) such cash as
shall be necessary to pay the Per Share Cash Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.4 and 2.2(a) hereof, and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares
to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof. Such cash and
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
theretofore has not submitted such holders Certificate or evidence of Book-
Entry Shares with a properly completed Election Form, a form letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The Company shall have
the right to review both the letter of transmittal and the instructions prior
to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments thereon. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.5 and upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate or evidence of
Book-Entry Share representing that

 



8  number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder of Company
Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article
I hereof and/or (y) a check representing the aggregate Per Share Cash
Consideration and/or the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration, the
cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid dividends and distributions,
if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
or both, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company

 



9  who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of
the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market as
reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately
preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional
shares and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

or as an exception to one or more of such partys representations or

10 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Article III, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below) on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a
financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHC Act"). The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, copies of which have previously been made available to Parent, are
true and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect"
means, with respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, any event,
change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts that is or
would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (i) the business,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any such effect attributable to or
resulting from (t) the announcement or pendency of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (u) any legal claims asserted or other actions
initiated by any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock arising out of or related to this Agreement, (v) any change in banking
or similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (w) any change
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") or
regulatory accounting principles applicable to banks, thrifts or their holding
companies generally, (x) changes attributable to or resulting from changes in
general economic conditions, including changes in the prevailing level of
interest rates, (y) any action or omission of the Company or Parent or any
Subsidiary of either of them taken in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or with the prior written consent of the other party hereto, or (z)
any expenses incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) the ability of such party and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) The Company Bank is a bank duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The deposit accounts
of the Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the "FDIC") to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due. Each of the Companys other Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has the
corporate (or equivalent) power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or the location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except

 



11  where the failure to be licensed or qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on such Subsidiary. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and
similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of
which have previously been made available to Parent, are true and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As
used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any
party means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes.

 

(c) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries contain true
and correct records of all meetings and other corporate (or equivalent)
actions held or taken since December 31, 2007 by their respective
shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be, and Boards of Directors
or similar governing authority (including committees thereof).

 

4.2 _Capitalization_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, of the
Company (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date of this Agreement,
there were 12,005,547 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. As of the

Company Option Plans, (ii) 241,367 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to the ESPP, and (iii) 920,866 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Companys Dividend Reinvestment
and Stock Purchase Plan (the "DRIP"). All of the issued and outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except as referred to above or
reflected in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity
security of the Company or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity
security of the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, the names of the
optionees, the date of each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted,
the number of shares subject to each such option, the expiration date and the
price at which each such option may be exercised under the Company Option
Plans are set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Each Company Option has been granted with an exercise price of not
less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the
date such Company Option was granted.

 

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except as set forth
in Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns,
directly or

 



12  indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock or
other equity interests of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of
such shares or equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of the Company
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary.

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_. (a) The Company has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The
Board of Directors of the Company has directed that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Companys
shareholders for approval and adoption at a meeting of such shareholders and,
except for the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite vote
of the Companys shareholders, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent) this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general
principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity
and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally.

 

(b) Except as may be set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions
hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of the Company or the articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar
governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) assuming that the
consents and approvals referred to in Section 4.4 hereof are duly
obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,

under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or

the Companys Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which executed
confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to Parent for informational
purposes), and (z) at least 72 hours prior to providing any information or
data to any person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
person, the Company notifies Parent in writing promptly of such 

 



36  inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information requested
from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such person and the material terms and conditions of
any inquiries, proposals or offers, and (iii) to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its shareholders referred to
in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior Proposal. The Company will
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of the
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any information related thereto, which
notification shall describe the Acquisition Proposal and identify the third
party making the same.

(c) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.3:

 

(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any proposal for a merger, acquisition of all of the stock or assets of,
or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the acquisition of a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial
portion of the assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to the Company, any
bona-fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other
than Parent which is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith concludes (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal, (A) is more favorable to its shareholders (in their capacities
as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B)
is reasonably capable of being completed.

(e) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay
to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2)
business days following such Payment Event, a fee of Thirteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000) (the "Break-up Fee").

"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) as a result of a breach by the Company of any of its
covenants under Section 7.3(a) or (c), Section 7.4 or Section 7.5 or pursuant
to Section 9.1(h), or (y) the occurrence of any of the following
events within twelve (12) months of the

 



37  termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c), provided that an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made by a Third Party after the date
hereof and prior to such termination (which shall not have been withdrawn in
good faith prior to such termination): (i) the Company merges with or into, or
is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, such Third
Party; (ii) such Third Party, directly or indirectly acquires more than 50%
of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(iii) such Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock; or (iv) the Company adopts or implements a
plan of liquidation, recapitalization or share repurchase relating to more
than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or an extraordinary dividend
relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 50% of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any such
case in which such Third Party is a participant. As used herein, "Third Party"
means any person as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (other than
Parent or its affiliates).

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.3(e)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Company fails to pay to Parent the Break-up Fee,
promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment was
due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.

 

7.4 _Shareholder Meetings_. The Company and Parent each shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective shareholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after
the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject, in the case of the Company, to the right of the Company and
its Board of Directors to take action permitted by Section 7.3(b) with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Parent each will, through
its respective Board of Directors, recommend to its respective shareholders
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its shareholders in
connection with this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the foregoing matters, with a view towards, among
other things, holding the respective meetings of each partys shareholders on
the same day.

 

7.5 _Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (a) to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption 

 



38  by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to
be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval.

7.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, subject to official notice
of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

7.7 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who become employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries
("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate, effective as soon
as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each of the
Parent Plans in which similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent that similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Parents severance plan; provided, however, that, in
the case of all benefits then provided to the Continuing Employees, until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent may instead provide such
employees with participation in the employee benefit plans of the Company in
which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
the result is the provision of benefits to Continuing Employees that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally (it being understood that
inclusion of Continuing Employees in Parents employee benefit plans may
occur at different times with respect to different plans). From and after the
Effective Time, Parent may elect not to provide to the Continuing Employees
any benefits which are not then provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to
their employees notwithstanding that such benefits were provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to their employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken into
account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service
credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including
for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of
defined benefit pension benefits); provided, however, that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations, if permitted by the
Parent Plan. If permitted by the Parent Plan and subject to the requirements
of applicable law, each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable
Company Plan, and Continuing Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid
under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plan. In the

 



39  event of a termination or consolidation of any health plan of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, terminated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
qualified beneficiaries shall have the right to continued coverage under
group health plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in accordance with COBRA.

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all the Plans, to the extent the Plans are in effect as of
the Effective Time. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will
constitute a "change in control" of the Company for all purposes to the extent
applicable under the Plans.

7.8 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company,
any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their
respective predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the bylaws of the
Company, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation incurred by each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in
the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that (1) Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Parent
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2)
Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for
only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (4) Parent shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such 

 



40  determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law, and (5) Parent shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party in respect of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, cost, expense, judgment or amount paid in settlements which arose
out of or resulted from the gross negligence, criminal activity, willful
misconduct or recklessness of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.8 except to the extent such failure
to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parents obligations under this
Section 7.8 shall continue in full force and effect without time limit from
and after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to vary, limit or otherwise restrict any rights or
indemnification protections afforded to any Indemnified Party by the bylaws
of the Company or by any other agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party, in each case as in effect prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such.

 

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

 

7.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

 

7.10 _Coordination of Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement each of
Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any

 



41  dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock
and the record dates and payments dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that the holders of Company Common Stock shall not
receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any
single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock
and any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common Stock
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

7.11 _Appointment of Directors; Advisory Board_. Effective as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Andrew S. Samuel and two other
current members of the Companys Board of Directors (collectively, the
"Appointed Directors"), who shall be designated prior to the Effective Time by
the Companys Board of Directors after consultation with Parent, to fill the
three open vacancies on Parents Board of Directors. If any such person does
not become a director of Parent because of death, disability or otherwise,
Parent agrees, after consultation with the members of the Companys Board of
Directors, to cause a different member of the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date hereof who is mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Company to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent as the
new Parent director. Nothing in this Section 7.11 shall require the election
or appointment of any individual whose election or appointment is prohibited
or advised against by any Regulatory Agency. Effective as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Appointed Director who is designated prior to the
Effective Time by the Companys Board of Directors after consultation with
Parent to be appointed to the Executive Committee of Parents Board of
Directors.

7.12 _Execution and Authorization of Bank Merger Agreement_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a)
Parent shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of the Parent Bank to approve
and adopt the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause the Parent Bank to execute and
deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and (iii) approve and adopt the Bank Merger
Agreement as the sole shareholder of the Parent Bank, and (b) the Company
shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of the Company Bank to approve and
adopt the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause the Company Bank to execute and
deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and (iii) approve and adopt the Bank
Merger Agreement as the sole shareholder of the Company Bank.

(b) The Bank Merger Agreement shall provide that effective as of the
effective time of the Bank Merger, the Surviving Bank and its Board of
Directors shall appoint each of the Appointed Directors as a director of the
Parent Bank, to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Bank (and Parent hereby covenants
to vote in favor of such appointment to the extent necessary). If any such
person does not become a director of the Surviving Bank because of death,
disability or otherwise, Parent agrees, after consultation with the members
of the Companys Board of Directors, to cause a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company as of the date hereof who is mutually agreeable to
Parent and the Company to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors
of the Surviving Bank as the replacement director.

 



42 (c) The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain other terms that are normal and
customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby and such
additional terms as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

7.13 _Outplacement Services for Company Employees_. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall permit all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries whose employment is terminated as of the Effective Time, as well
as all Continuing Employees whose employment is terminated in the six (6)
month period following the Effective Time, to participate in Parents
outplacement services plan for employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
which outplacement services shall be provided for a period of not less than
six months following the termination of employment by an outplacement agency
selected by Parent.

 

7.14 _Dividend Reinvestment_. The Company shall take all such necessary action
to suspend the acceptance of dividends and other contributions of
participants in the DRIP effective promptly after the date of this Agreement
(taking into account any Company dividends that have been declared but not yet
paid as of the date hereof). In addition, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take such action as is necessary to terminate the DRIP and
shall distribute all shares of Company Common Stock and the value of all cash
held in participants plan accounts in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.

 

7.15 _New Employment Agreements_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall enter into employment agreements with Andrew Samuel,
Janak Amin and Jeffrey Renninger (collectively, the "New Employees") which
will be effective as of the Effective Time and will be substantially in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit A, Exhibit B and Exhibit C, respectively
(the "New Employment Agreements").

7.16 _ESOP Matters_. The Company Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
"ESOP") shall be terminated by the Company Bank in accordance with its terms
effective as of the Effective Time unless the Parent notifies the Company Bank
of its intention to continue the ESOP after the Effective Time as set forth
in Section 7.7. The accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP
as of the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time.
Any shares of Company Common Stock held in the ESOP shall be converted into
the Merger Consideration and shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts
of ESOP participants who have account balances in the ESOP in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the ESOP. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the ESOP.
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time or the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of
the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall be
either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct. Parent agrees to permit Continuing
Employees to rollover the cash portion of their account balances in the ESOP
to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 



43 7.17 _401(k) Plan Matters_. The Company Bank shall take all actions necessary
to terminate its 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") effective as of or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless the Parent notifies the
Company Bank of its intention to continue the 401(k) Plan after the Effective
Time as set forth in Section 7.7. The accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time shall become fully
vested upon termination of the 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable following
the Effective Time or the receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS regarding the qualified status of the 401(k) Plan upon its
termination, the account balances in the 401(k) Plan shall be either
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct. Parent agrees to permit Continuing
Employees to rollover their account balances in the 401(k) Plan to the Parent
401(k) Plan.

 

7.18 _Retention Bonuses_. The Company desires to pay retention bonuses to
selected employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed by
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Parent and its Subsidiaries through
certain dates following the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, in
consultation with the Parent, the Company will select which employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be eligible to receive a retention bonus
and the amount of each such retention bonus. Prior to the Closing, the Company
and the Parent will mutually determine the date through which each such
employee must remain employed to be eligible for the bonus. The aggregate
amount of such retention bonuses will not exceed $750,000, unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Parent.

7.19 _Payouts under the Company s Incentive Plans and Deferred Compensation
Agreements_. The Parent agrees that (i) participants in any incentive plan of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to receive from the
Company or a Company Subsidiary incentive bonuses at no less than the "Target"
levels set forth in the applicable incentive plan regardless of actual
achievement of such Targets; provided, however, that no incentive bonuses
shall be paid unless a "Threshold" level of performance is achieved pursuant
to the terms of such incentive plans; and (ii) employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who are parties to deferred compensation agreements with
the Company or a Company Subsidiary shall be entitled to receive from the
Company or a Company Subsidiary the guaranteed grant of 3% of Base Salary and
an additional Grant or bonus at no less than the minimum performance payout
level set forth in the applicable deferred compensation agreement regardless
of actual achievement of the performance target. The foregoing amounts shall
be paid by the Company or a Company Subsidiary or, following the Closing, the
Parent or a Parent Subsidiary, on the scheduled payment date provided by the
applicable plan or agreement.

7.20  _Compliance with Section 409A_. Prior to the Effective Time, and to
the extent any such Plans are eligible for correction or amendment, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary shall take any and all actions necessary,
pursuant to the IRS guidance under Notice 2008-113, Notice 2010-6 or Notice
2010-80, to ensure that each Plan that is deemed to constitute a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan subject to section 409A of the Code is in
operational and documentary compliance with section 409A of the Code as of
the Effective Time. To the extent that the Company or a

 



44  Company Subsidiary has identified any potential failure of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the
Company will provide to the Parent: (a) notice regarding any such potential
failure, (b) documentation regarding any such required correction prior to
such correction, and (c) evidence such correction has been completed,
including evidence that the Company or Company Subsidiary and any affected
individual has satisfied or will satisfy the reporting requirements, as
applicable.

this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

(c) _No Pending Governmental Actions_. No proceeding initiated by any
Governmental Entity seeking an Injunction shall be pending.

 

(d) _Federal Tax Opinion_. The Company shall have received an opinion from
Rhoads and Sinon LLP (the "Companys Counsel"), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, dated the Effective Time,
substantially to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent with the state of
facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
such opinion, the Companys Counsel may require and rely upon representations
and covenants, including those contained in certificates of officers of
Parent, the Company and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to such counsel. For the purpose of determining whether the payment of the
Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to this Agreement
satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e), the opinion shall assume that at least forty percent (40%) of such
amounts must be payable in Parent Common Stock (as compared to cash or other
consideration) in order for the Merger to be treated as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



47 ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of both the Company and Parent:

 

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other
party (i) 30 days after the date on which any request or application for a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the
request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such
Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such
denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has
been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided, however, that no
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein) or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before April 30, 2012, unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, provided that such party is not then in
material breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.4, if any approval
of the shareholders of either of the Company or Parent required for the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain, after the use of all
reasonable efforts, the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing (as hereinafter defined);
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation
or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party

 



48  receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a breach of
representation or warranty by the Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of
a breach of representation or warranty by Parent);

(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from
the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Closing; or

(g) by the Company at any time during the three-day period following the
Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof), if both of the
following conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied:

(1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than the
product of 0.800 and the Starting Price; and

(2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below)
and subtracting 0.200 from such quotient (such number being referred to herein
as the "Index Ratio");

subject to the following. If the Company elects to exercise its termination
right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written notice to Parent; provided that such notice of election to terminate
may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned three-day period.
During the three-business-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio
and/or the Total Cash Amount in a manner such, and to the extent required, so
that the condition set forth in either clause (1) or (2) above shall be deemed
not to exist; provided, however, that the Total Cash Amount shall not be
increased in a manner that would cause the failure of the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.2(d) or 8.3(d) hereof.

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

the Exchange Ratio and/or the Total Cash Amount is increased so that the Per
Share Consideration (calculated by using the Average Closing Price, as
provided in the definition of "Per Share Consideration") after such increase
is not less than 80% of the Per Share Consideration calculated by using
the Starting Price in lieu of the Average Closing Price.

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

the Exchange Ratio and/or the Total Cash Amount is increased so that the
Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less than the Index Ratio.

 



49 If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio
and/or Total Cash Amount, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio and/or Total Cash
Amount, and derivatively the Per Share Stock Consideration, shall have been so
modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio," and/or
"Total Cash Amount" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio
and/or Total Cash Amount after giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant
to this Section 9.1(g). For purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:

 

"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by dividing (x) the sum of
(A) the Average Closing Price multiplied by the initial Exchange Ratio, plus
(B) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate increase in transaction
value resulting from an increase in the Exchange Ratio and/or the Total Cash
Amount by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, by
(y) (A) the Starting Price multiplied by (B) the initial Exchange Ratio. For
purposes of calculating the increase in transaction value, the price per share
of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to be the Average Closing Price.

"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices per
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
mutually agreed upon authoritative source) for the twenty consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4
hereof).

"Determination Date" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section
1.4(a).

"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index. 

"Per Share Consideration" means the sum of (i) the product of the Per Share
Stock Consideration times the Average Closing Price times the percentage of
the total value of the aggregate Merger Consideration that is composed of
Parent common stock plus (ii) the product of the Per Share Cash Consideration
times the percentage of the total value of the aggregate Merger Consideration
that is composed of cash.

"Starting Date" means the trading day on the NASDAQ Stock Market preceding
the day on which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.

"Starting Price" means $8.07.

If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices
for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).

 



50 (h) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, or (ii) prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys shareholders, any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) shall have become
the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of at least 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock, and the Company
Board of Directors shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the recommendation
for approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby required by Section 7.4 within five business days after Parent
requests that the Company Board of Directors publicly reaffirm such
recommendation.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b), 7.3(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval and
adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby, by the shareholders of either the Company or Parent; provided,
however, that after any approval and adoption of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Companys shareholders,
there may not be, without further approval and adoption of such shareholders,
any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form
of the consideration to be delivered to the Company shareholders hereunder
other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 

9.4 _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of

applicable law, rule or regulation.

 

10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not

10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and

were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of Section
7.2(b) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

 



53 10.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

10.11 _Publicity_. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or
otherwise required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press

unreasonably withheld.

Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
Merger and/or the Bank Merger subject to the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided
that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common
Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such
modification, (ii) there are no adverse tax consequences to the shareholders
of the Company as a result of such modification, (iii) there are no adverse
tax consequences to Parent or the Company as a result of such modification and
(iv) such modification will not jeopardize or materially delay receipt of any
