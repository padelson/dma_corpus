Stock equal to the number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time.

(ii) At the First Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares and
any Shares held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive one (1) share of Initial Surviving
Company Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ and, upon
the automatic exchange in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, (A) the

outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or payable in
respect thereof and each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share,

Section 2.3  _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_ _; Contribution in Kind_. Prior to the First Effective
Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company located in New York City
selected by Parent and acceptable to the Company (which acceptance shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_ and enter into an
agreement acceptable to the Company (which acceptance shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) with the Exchange Agent
relating to the services to be performed by the Exchange Agent. Immediately
following the First Effective Time and prior to the Second Effective Time, and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code (
_Burgerlijk_ ___Wetboek_ ), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent, acting
solely in its capacity as exchange agent hereunder, to contribute, for the
account and benefit of the former holders of Shares, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Initial Surviving Company Stock that were issued to the
Exchange Agent for the account and benefit of the former holders of Shares
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ to Parent as a contribution in
kind ( _inbreng_ _op_ _aandelen_ ___anders_ ___dan_ _in geld_ ). In
consideration of this contribution in kind, at the First Effective Time and
prior to the Second Effective Time, Parent shall, subject to _Section_ __ _
2.6_ _,_ (i) issue ( _uitgeven_ ) and deliver ( _leveren_ ) to the Exchange
Agent for immediate delivery to the Depositary Bank or its nominee, solely in
its capacity as such, a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Parent ADSs issuable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ and (ii) cause to be issued and
delivered, upon delivery of the foregoing Parent Ordinary Shares by the
Exchange Agent to the Depositary Bank or its nominee, to the Exchange Agent
for the account and benefit of the former holders of Shares (A) receipts
representing the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ (or
make appropriate alternative arrangements if uncertificated Parent ADSs
represented by a book-entry will be issued), (B) cash in an amount sufficient
to make all requisite payments of (x) cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (y) dividends or other distributions
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, in
each case without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) (such
Parent ADSs and cash amounts so made available to the Exchange Agent are
referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations
of the United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other income from
such investments shall become part of the funds held by the Exchange Agent
for purposes of paying amounts payable in accordance with this _Article_ __ _
II_. No investment by the Exchange Agent of the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall relieve Parent, the Initial Surviving Company, the Final Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article_ __ _ II_ and Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with
the Exchange Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_. No investment by the Exchange Agent of the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments being made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the First Effective
Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, additional cash in an amount sufficient to pay (A) cash in lieu of
any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (B) any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, in each case
without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the First Effective
Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the First
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares which were converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ into the Merger Consideration:

 



6

    

 (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which, in the case of Shares
represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ to the Exchange Agent), such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.3(f)_) or receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the terms of the letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of a
Share which was converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ into
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger Consideration, together
with (x) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (y) any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.3(c)_, in each case without interest (subject to any applicable
withholding Tax), for each Share surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. Unless requested otherwise by the Company, the
Parent ADSs to be delivered as Merger Consideration shall be eligible for
settlement through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") and issued in
uncertificated book-entry form through the procedures of DTC to such account
as specified in the preceding sentence, unless a physical Parent ADS is
requested or otherwise required by applicable Law, in which case Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to promptly send such receipt representing such
Parent ADSs to such holder. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting such exchange present
proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Parent _ _ADSs_. All
Parent ADSs (and the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) to be issued as the
Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the First
Effective Time; _provided_ that no dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the First Effective Time with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares
or Parent ADSs with a record date after the First Effective Time will be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with
respect to the Parent ADSs to be issued in exchange therefor, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares will be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, until the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the holder of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing whole Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor
will be paid, without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax),
(i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the First Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Parent ADS and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the First Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,
payable with respect to such whole Parent ADS.

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. At
the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Initial Surviving Company or Final Surviving
Company, as applicable, of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time. From and after the
First Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the (i)
Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (iii)
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled

 



7

    

 pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, in each case without interest (subject
to any applicable withholding Tax), except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_,
if, at any time after the First Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Initial Surviving Company or Final Surviving Company, as applicable, for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article_ __ _ II_.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent ADSs will be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and any holder of
record of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
Parent ADS shall, in lieu thereof, be entitled to receive an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent, without interest and subject to any withholding
Tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional Parent
ADS interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded to
three decimal places after applying the Exchange Ratio and after aggregating
all fractional Parent ADS interests that would otherwise be received by such
holder) by (ii) an amount equal to the Closing VWAP. Any amounts to which a
holder of Shares is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ shall
be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable following surrender of such
holders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or, in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit of loss thereof in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_.

(f)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Initial Surviving Company or Final Surviving
Company, as applicable, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, (i) the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article_ __ _ II_, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (iii) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, in each case without interest (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax).

 

(g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Final Surviving Company shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds or other property (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this 
_Article_ __ _ II_, and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be entitled to look only to the
Initial Surviving Company or Final Surviving Company, as applicable, (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, in each case
without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax), that may be
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Initial Surviving
Company or the Final Surviving Company will be liable to any Person for any
Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent ADSs) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by any Person as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Initial Surviving Company, the
Final Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any applicable provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Law related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the

 



8

    

 withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

Section 2.4 _Company Stock Options and_ _RSUs_.

 

(a) Each option that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock and that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(whether or not then vested or exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") shall at
the First Effective Time be converted into an option (each, an " _Assumed
Option_ ") to purchase a number of Parent ADSs (or Parent Ordinary Shares, as
determined by Parent acting reasonably) (rounded down to the nearest number of
whole Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares, as the case may be) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Option immediately prior
to the First Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Any
restrictions on the exercise of any Assumed Option shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule (including any
double-trigger vesting) and other provisions of such Assumed Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Assumed
Option.

(b) Each restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") shall at the First Effective Time be
converted into a restricted stock unit of Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ ")
with respect to a number of Parent ADSs (or Parent Ordinary Shares, as
determined by Parent acting reasonably) (rounded to the nearest number of
whole Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares, as the case may be) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. The vesting schedule (including any double-trigger vesting)
and other provisions of such Assumed RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a
result of the assumption of such Assumed RSU.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Assumed Option and each Assumed RSU in
respect of Parent Ordinary Shares shall provide that upon exercise or
settlement, as applicable, the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares may, at the
election of Parent, be deposited in Stichting Administratiekantoor
Takeaway.com (" _STAK_ "), which shall hold such Parent Ordinary Shares
on behalf of the former holder of the Assumed Option or Assumed RSU, as
applicable, and exercise all voting rights with respect to such Parent
Ordinary Shares, and such former holder shall receive one depository receipt
of the STAK with respect to each such Parent Ordinary Share so deposited
(each, a " _STAK DR_ "). Each STAK DR shall entitle the holder thereof to all
economic benefits of the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares and, subject to any
blackout or restrictions under applicable Law, entitle the holder thereof to
direct the STAK to sell the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares and transfer the
proceeds to the holder thereof.

 

(d) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Company Stock Plans, the Options and the
Company RSUs) will take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to
give effect to this _Section 2.4_.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination, exchange or readjustment of outstanding shares, any stock
dividend or stock distribution in respect of outstanding shares (including any
dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company or the Company or of securities convertible into Parent Ordinary
Shares, Parent ADSs or Company Common Stock to holders of outstanding
shares), reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification with a record
date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize
any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized
or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _P_ _arent Ordinary Shares_. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) upon
Parents reasonable determination, Parent may, or (ii) upon the Companys
reasonable request to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall, permit
(but not obligate) holders of Shares to elect to receive a number of Parent
Ordinary Shares (or CREST depositary interests eligible for trading through
CREST representing beneficial ownership interests in a number of Parent
Ordinary Shares (" _CDIs_ ")) equal to the Exchange Ratio for each outstanding
Share in lieu of the Parent ADSs issuable as the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, in which event the Exchange Agent
shall not deliver such number of Parent Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Bank
or its nominee under _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ and (a) any and all Parent
Ordinary Shares (or CDIs) delivered to such holders of Shares who have elected
to receive Parent Ordinary Shares (or CDIs) shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, be deemed to be the Merger Consideration and (b) with respect to
any holders of Shares who have elected to receive Parent Ordinary Shares,
Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Agreement
with respect to Parent ADSs through the registration, issuance, delivery and
listing of Parent Ordinary Shares (or CDIs).

(b) In the event that, prior to the date of the initial filing of the Form
F-4, Parent, acting in good faith (after consulting with and considering in
good faith the views of the Company), reasonably determines that it is
desirable to issue Parent Ordinary Shares as the Merger Consideration in lieu
of Parent ADSs to the holders of Shares, the parties hereto agree to negotiate
and cooperate in good faith to enter into an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement to reflect such change in the form of the Merger Consideration and
provide for other changes necessitated thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure of the parties hereto to agree to such an amendment shall not cause
any condition to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or otherwise
cause any breach of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that (i) any actions
taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ shall not, without the prior
written consent of each of Parent and the Company, (A) alter or change the
Exchange Ratio or the amount, nature or mix of the Merger Consideration (or
the consideration payable to holders of Options and Company RSUs pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_), other than the substitution of Parent Ordinary Shares
for Parent ADSs, (B) impose any material economic or other cost on Parent or
its shareholders or the Company or its stockholders, (C) adversely affect the
Intended Tax Treatment or otherwise result in any material adverse Tax impact
to the stockholders of the Company or the parties hereto, (D) prevent or
materially delay or impair the receipt of any consents or approvals of, or the
completion of any notices to or filings, declarations or registrations with,
any Governmental Authority that are necessary for the consummation of the
Transactions, or (E) prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation of
the Transactions, (ii) any such Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued as the
Merger Consideration shall, as of the First Effective Time, have been
approved for listing on the NYSE or the NASDAQ, subject only to official
notice of issuance and (iii) such amendment would not be expected to have any
of the effects or consequences in _clauses (i)(A)_ through _(i)(E)_ above.

The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties

any such agreements relating to any Parent Securities, including any

been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares issuable in
connection with the Transactions for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or

the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form F-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form

meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon adoption of this
Agreement and such other matters as may be then legally required (including
any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) with the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (ii) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the stockholders of the Company
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (iii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by
proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum or to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, to allow additional time for solicitation of proxies for
purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval, as
applicable, (iv) as may be required by applicable Law or (v) if the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof), after consultation with
outside counsel, reasonably believes in good faith that failure to postpone,
recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting would be inconsistent with
the Company directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that,
except as required by applicable Law, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall
not be postponed, recessed or adjourned to a date that is more than 43 days
after the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled or less than five Business Days prior to the End Date, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval, including by actively
soliciting proxies. Unless the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (A) the Company Board shall recommend to its
stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given and (B) the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 

(d) Parent shall prior to the First Effective Time (x) prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form 8-A relating to the registration
under the Exchange Act of the Parent ADSs to be issued in the Transactions and
the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares (the " _Form  8-A_") and (y) cause the
Depositary Bank to prepare and file with the SEC, no later than the date
prescribed by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act, a
registration statement on Form F-6 relating to the registration under the
Securities Act of the issuance of the Parent ADSs (the " _Form F-6_"). Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form 8-A declared effective
under the Exchange Act and the Form F-6 declared effective under the
Securities Act, in each case, as promptly as practicable after such filing
and to keep the Form 8-A and the Form F-6 effective as long as necessary to
consummate the Transactions. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be
filed, (i) with the FCA for its approval a draft copy of the Parent Circular,
(ii) with, in each case if then applicable, (A) the AFM for its approval
(and, following its approval, notification of its approval in accordance with
the Prospectus Regulation to the FCA, to the extent then permitted by
applicable Law) and (B) the FCA for its approval, a draft of a listing
prospectus (the " _Parent Prospectus_ ") under (x) in the case of the AFM,
the European Union Prospectus Regulation and any rules and regulations
relating thereto (the " _Prospectus Regulation_ ") and applicable Dutch
securities Laws with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the
Parent ADSs to be issued pursuant to this Agreement and (y) in the case of the
FCA, the Prospectus Regulation Rules and any applicable UK securities Laws
with respect to the 

 



42

    

 Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Parent ADSs to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) if then applicable, an application to the AFM to notify
its approval of the Parent Prospectus to the FCA in accordance with the
Prospectus Regulation and applicable Law, (iv) an application with either the
NYSE or the NASDAQ for the listing of Parent ADSs on such exchange and (v) in

be issued pursuant to this Agreement to trading on the Premium Segment of the
LSEs Main Market for listed securities. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) make available to Parent all information (including
financial statements and reports or consents of third parties), (y) cause its
auditors and other relevant professional advisors to cooperate in providing
financial and other information (including consents) and (z) provide such
other assistance, in the case of each of _clauses (x)_ , _(y)_ and _(z)_ , as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Parent Circulars and the Parent Prospectus and any
amendments or supplements thereto. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain formal approval of the Parent Circular from the FCA and
approval of the Parent Prospectus from the AFM and the FCA (in each case, to
the extent then applicable) and, to the extent notification of approval is
then permitted, notification of approval of the Parent Prospectus to the FCA
as promptly as reasonably practicable, including using its reasonable best
efforts to respond to any comments of the FCA or the AFM with respect to
the Parent Circular or the Parent Prospectus, as applicable, and to maintain
the current status of the Parent Prospectus as long as necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other Transactions. No filing or publication of, or
substantive correspondence with the FCA, the AFM or their respective staffs
with respect to, the Parent Circulars or the Parent Prospectus will be made by
Parent without providing the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon and considering in good faith all comments reasonably
proposed by the Company. Parent shall, in any event, ensure that all
information contained in the Parent Circulars (including any Supplementary
Parent Circulars) or the Parent Prospectus which relates solely to the
Company or its Affiliates or their respective officers and directors is
consistent with the information provided to Parent by the Company or its
Representatives. Parent will advise the Company promptly after it receives
oral or written notice of the time when the Parent Circular or the Parent
Prospectus has been approved or any supplement or amendment has been filed or
published, or any oral or written request by the FCA or the AFM for amendment
of the Parent Circulars or the Parent Prospectus or comments thereon and
written responses thereto or requests by the FCA or the AFM for additional
information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
communication from the FCA or the AFM. If, at any time prior to obtaining the
Parent Shareholder Approval (in the case of the Parent Circulars) or the First
Effective Time (in the case of the Parent Prospectus), any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which
would reasonably be expected to require disclosure in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Parent Circulars or the Parent Prospectus so that the
relevant Parent Circular and/or the Parent Prospectus (as applicable) shall
contain every significant new factor and shall not contain any material
mistake or material inaccuracy relating to the information therein which may
affect the assessment of the Parent Ordinary Shares or so that the Parent
Circular may be updated for any material change or material new matter which
Parent would have been required to disclose, in the Parent Circular, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and Parent shall procure that an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information is promptly filed or published in
accordance with the requirements of applicable Law and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of Parent.

(e) Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Parent
Circular has been approved by the FCA, duly give notice of, convene and hold
an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon
the Transaction Proposals, the Board Nominations and the Pre-Emptive Rights
Authorization (such meeting, including any reconvention thereof, the "
_Parent S_ _hare_ _holders Meeting_ "), including publishing the Parent
Circular and making available at Parents registered office in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, the Parent Circular, in each case in accordance with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may cancel and

 



43

    

 reconvene the Parent Shareholders Meeting (i) with the prior written consent
of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (ii)
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Parent Circulars
is provided to the shareholders of Parent within a reasonable amount of time
in advance of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, (iii) if there are not
sufficient affirmative votes present or represented at such meeting or to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, to allow additional time for
solicitation of additional votes for purposes of obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, (iv) as may be required by applicable Law or (v) if the
Parent Boards (or a duly authorized committee thereof), after consultation
with outside counsel, reasonably believes in good faith that failure to cancel
and reconvene the Parent Shareholders Meeting would be inconsistent with
the Parent directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that,
except as required by applicable Law, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall
not be cancelled and reconvened to a date that is more than 43 days after the
date on which the Parent Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled or
less than five Business Days prior to the End Date, in each case without the
prior written consent of the Company.

 

(f) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the holders of
Parent Ordinary Shares the Parent Shareholder Approval and the Pre-Emptive
Rights Authorization, including by actively engaging with and seeking the
support of the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares. Unless the Parent Boards (or
any duly authorized committee thereof) have made a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, (A) the Parent
Boards shall recommend to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares that the
Parent Shareholder Approval and the Pre-Emptive Rights Authorization be given
(the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ") and (B) Parent shall include the
Parent Board Recommendation in the Parent Circulars.

permit any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Representatives to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, (A) initiate, seek, solicit or knowingly

regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), or knowingly induce or
knowingly facilitate or take any other action which would reasonably
be expected to lead to the making, submission or announcement of any Company
Takeover Proposal, (B) engage or participate in negotiations or discussions
with, or provide any non-public information or non-public data to, any Person
(other than Parent or any Parent Representatives) relating to any Company
Takeover Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other
agreement (except that if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to grant any waiver or release would be inconsistent
with the Company directors fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision in order to permit a third
party to make a Company Takeover Proposal) or (C) resolve to do any of the
foregoing; (iii) the Company shall not provide and shall, within twenty-four
(24) hours of the date hereof, terminate access of any third party to any data
room (virtual or actual) containing any of the Companys confidential
information; and (iv) within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof,
the Company shall request the return or destruction of all confidential, non-
public information provided to third parties that have entered into
confidentiality agreements relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ or
any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) from taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders its position with respect to any

in accordance with this sentence that constitutes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall result in all of the consequences of a Company

the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this

 



44

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ by any Subsidiaries of the Company or any Company
Representatives shall constitute a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_
by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a written Company Takeover
Proposal from a third party and the receipt of such Company Takeover Proposal
was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly
induced or knowingly facilitated in material violation of  _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_, then the Company may (i) contact the Person who has made such Company
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives in order to clarify the terms of
such Company Takeover Proposal so that the Company Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) may inform itself about such Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) furnish information concerning its business, properties or

any case within one (1) Business Day) provide Parent notice (1) of the receipt

reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after
receiving a written request to do so from Parent if any Company Takeover
Proposal or any material modification thereto shall have been publicly made,
sent or given to the Companys stockholders (or, if sooner, prior to the then-
scheduled Company Stockholders Meeting) (provided that Parent may only make
such request once with respect to any particular Company Takeover Proposal or
any modification thereto) (any action described in this _clause (_ _i_ _)_
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
cause or permit the Company to enter into any agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or other Contract with

(d) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) receives a Company

Proposal, the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may
(i) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(iii)_
in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Company
Superior Proposal (any such agreement, a " _Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), in the case of each of _clauses (_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ if (A)

directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company has
notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement (which notice shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), including if applicable
a copy of the proposed Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement between the

of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to _clause
(_ _B_ _)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, the Company shall have made
Company Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in
each case, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company Takeover Proposal that is the subject of the
notice described in _clause (B)_ above no longer constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term
or condition of any Company Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a
new negotiation period (except that such new negotiation period shall be for
two (2) Business Days)); and (D) no earlier than the end of such negotiation
period, the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor), after considering the terms of any proposed amendment
or modification to this Agreement, that (x) the Company Takeover Proposal
that is the subject of the notice described in _clause (_ _B_ _)_ above would
still constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such
action would still be inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(e)_), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval

committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change due to the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event (which notice shall specify and
describe the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail and which notice
shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change); (iii) for a
period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, the Company shall have made
Company Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in
each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), with Parent
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to the Company Intervening Event shall require a new
notice and a new negotiation period (except that such new negotiation period
shall be for two (2) Business Days)); and (iv) no earlier than the end of the
negotiation period, the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor), after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to
take such action would still be inconsistent with the Companys directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean a
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent) providing for any (i)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,

taken as a whole, as of or for the fiscal year ending, as
appropriate, December 31, 2019, or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of

the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Transactions and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed,
in the case of each of _clauses (_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ , taking into account
at the time of determination all relevant circumstances, including the

(d) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, the
Parent Boards (or any duly authorized committee thereof) receive a Parent
Takeover Proposal that it determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a Parent Superior
Proposal, the Parent Boards (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may
(i) effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) authorize Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iii)_ in order to
enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Parent Superior
Proposal (any such agreement, a " _Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
"), in the case of each of _clauses (_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ if (A) the Parent
Boards (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determine in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Parent directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) Parent has notified the Company in
writing that it intends to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement (which notice shall not constitute a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change), including if applicable, a copy of the proposed
Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement between the Parent and the Person

Days following the notice delivered pursuant to  _clause_ __ _ (_ _B_ _)_ of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, Parent shall have made Parent Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case, to the extent
the Company desires to negotiate) with Company Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Parent
Takeover Proposal that is the subject of the notice described in _clause (B)_
above no longer constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or the failure to take
such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Parent directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term or condition of any Company Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period (except that such new
negotiation period shall be for two (2) Business Days)); and (iv) no earlier
than the end of such negotiation period, the Parent Boards (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor), after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that (x) the Parent Takeover Proposal that is the subject of the
notice described in _clause (_ _B_ _)_ above would still constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still
be inconsistent with the Parent directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

(e) Other than in connection with a Parent Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section_
__ _ 5.4(e)_), prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval the Parent
Boards (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, but only in response to a Parent Intervening Event and
only if (i) the Parent Boards (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determine in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Parent directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (ii) Parent has notified the Company in writing that it
intends to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change due to the occurrence
of a Parent Intervening Event (which notice shall specify and describe the
Parent Intervening Event in reasonable detail and which notice shall
not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change); (iii) for a period of
four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to _clause
(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, Parent shall have made
Parent Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in
each case to the extent the Company desires to negotiate), with Company
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Parent directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to the Parent Intervening Event shall require a new
notice and a new negotiation period (except that such new negotiation period
shall be for two (2) Business Days)); and (iv) no earlier than the end of the
negotiation period, the Parent Boards (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor), after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to
take such action would still be inconsistent with the Parent directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Parent Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean a
proposal or offer from any Person (other than the Company) providing for any
(i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business

as a whole, as of or for the fiscal year ending, as appropriate, December 31,
2019, or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of Parents revenues, earnings

power of Parent or (v) combination of the foregoing; _provided_ that any
proposal or offer providing for any transaction or series of transactions
related solely to the businesses and Persons identified on _Section_ __ _
5.4(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (or any assets utilized therein or
the capital stock, voting securities or other interests in any Person that
conducts such businesses or holds such assets).

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
_bona fide_ written Parent Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes
of this definition references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of

with its outside counsel and financial advisor) to be (i) more favorable to
Parents stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions and
(ii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in the case of
each of _clauses (_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ , taking into account at the time of

financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and any changes to the terms of
this Agreement offered by the Company in response to such Parent Takeover
Proposal.

5.5(c)_, the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, following the

of incorporation and bylaws of the Final Surviving Company to include
provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and officers,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no
less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter
Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by
applicable Law until the sixth anniversary of the First Effective Time.

(b) From and after the First Effective Time until the sixth anniversary
thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the Initial Surviving Company and the
Final Surviving Company, as applicable, to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee
any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
any Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under _Section_ __ _
5.9(a)_ or the enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this _Section_ __ _
5.9_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
and the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses (but only to the extent and in the form
required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements).

 

(c) Each of Parent, the Initial Surviving Company and the Final Surviving
Company shall cooperate with the Indemnitees in the defense of any Claim and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested by an Indemnitee in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
5.9_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause
the Initial Surviving Company and the Final Surviving Company not to) settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek

Indemnitees covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
from all liability arising out of such Claim.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect at least the same coverage provided by the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof maintained by the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the First
Effective Time either through the Companys existing insurance provider or
another provider reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after the First Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may at any time purchase
"tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount
which Parent, the Initial Surviving Company or the Final Surviving Company
would be required to spend during the sixyear period provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_, that provides coverage no materially less favorable
than the coverage described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Law, contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent, the Initial Surviving Company and Final Surviving
Company under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ applies unless the affected Indemnitee shall
have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_). 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Initial Surviving Company or Final Surviving
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Initial Surviving Company and Final
Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party hereto shall keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed of, and cooperate with the other parties
hereto in connection with, any litigation or claim brought or threatened
against any party hereto or its directors, officers or employees relating
to the Transactions (any such litigation or claim, " _Transaction Litigation_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require any party
hereto to take any action if it may result in a waiver of any attorney-
client or any other similar privilege; _provided_ _further_ that such party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for the taking of such action
in a manner that does not result in a waiver of such privilege, including by
entering into a customary joint defense or similar agreement. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
Transaction Litigation brought or threatened against the Company or its
directors, officers or employees, shall consider in good faith Parents
advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation and shall not settle or
agree to settle any such Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Notwithstanding the above, Parents consent to settle any
Transaction Litigation shall not be required to the extent such __ Transaction
Litigation is settled solely for the payment of monies which are reasonably
likely to be recoverable from __ insurance policies available to the Company
or its Representatives (other than any deductibles or retention amounts
applicable thereto).

 

Section 5.11 _Section 16_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect to
such equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is or will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



56

    

Section 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the First Effective Time until the later of (i) one (1)
year following the First Effective Time and (ii) December 31, 2021 (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the
Initial Surviving Company, the Final Surviving Company and their Subsidiaries)
as of the First Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), (A) an annual base
salary or base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities and equity
incentive compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less favorable
than the annual base salary or base wages, recurring cash incentive
compensation opportunities and equity incentive compensation opportunities
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the First Effective
Time and (B) employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits (excluding for this purpose defined benefit pension, post-
employment health and welfare benefits, equity-based compensation and change
of control, retention or other one-off awards) provided to such Company
Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First
Effective Time. In addition, (i) Parent shall or shall cause the Initial
Surviving Company and Final Surviving Company to provide each Company Employee
whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period with severance pay
and benefits at levels equal to the greater of those provided under (A) the
Companys severance policies as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and (B) Parents severance policies applicable to
similarly situated employees of Parent and (ii) such severance pay and
benefits shall be determined taking into account the service crediting
provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the First
Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent
shall credit each Company Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
First Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the First
Effective Time;  _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
(i) each Company Employee to become immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Initial
Surviving Company, the Final Surviving Company and their Subsidiaries to
honor all obligations under the Company Plans and compensation and severance
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the First Effective Time and Parent hereby acknowledges
that the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control," "change of control" or "corporate transaction" under the
Company Plans listed on  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 



57

    

(d) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Initial
Surviving Company to continue to operate the Companys annual incentive plans
and any other applicable annual bonus plan for the performance period during
which the First Effective Time occurs, consistent with past practice, through
the end of the applicable performance period, and shall pay each Company
Employee the bonus to which the Company Employee would be entitled for such
performance period based on actual performance, and otherwise in accordance
with the terms of such plans. In addition, to the extent that the First
Effective Time occurs following the end of a performance period with respect
to the Companys annual incentive plans or any other applicable annual bonus
plan and before the payment of bonuses for such completed performance period,
Parent shall cause the Initial Surviving Company to pay to each Company
Employee the bonus to which the Company Employee would be entitled for such
performance period based on actual performance.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_, the parties hereto hereby agree to take the additional
actions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.12(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.7,_ the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give any Person (including for the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

as an amendment to any Company Plan, Parent Plan or other compensation or
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or understanding for any
purpose, (ii) obligate Parent, the Initial Surviving Company or the Final
Surviving Company to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement
or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee or (iii) prevent

Section 5.13 _Merger Subs; Initial Surviving Company; Final Surviving_
_Company_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all actions necessary to (i) cause each Merger Sub, the
Initial Surviving Company and the Final Surviving Company to perform promptly
their respective obligations under this Agreement and (ii) cause each Merger
Sub to consummate the Mergers and the other Transactions on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent
shall adopt this Agreement as the sole stockholder, as applicable, of each
Merger Sub and shall promptly provide evidence of such adoption to the
Company.

Section 5.14  _Takeover Laws_. The Company, the Company Board, Parent and the
Parent Boards shall each (a) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Transactions and (b) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute becomes applicable to the Transactions, use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 

Section 5.15 _Establishment of ADR Facility;_ _Reservation of Shares; Stock
Exchange Listing_.

(a) Parent shall cause a sponsored American depositary receipt (" _ADR_ ")
facility (the " _ADR Facility_ ") to be established with a reputable national
bank acceptable to the Company (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the " _Depositary Bank_ ") for the purpose
of issuing the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to this Agreement, including
entering into a customary deposit agreement with the Depositary Bank
establishing the ADR Facility (the " _Deposit Agreement_ "), to be effective

the comments of the Company on the Deposit Agreement and shall not enter into
the Deposit Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Subject
to applicable Law, the Deposit Agreement shall (i) provide (A) that each
Parent ADS under the ADR Facility shall represent and be exchangeable for one
Parent Ordinary Share ranking _pari_ ___passu_ with all other Parent
Ordinary Shares in issue at the First Effective Time, including in respect of
any entitlement to dividends or other distributions declared, paid or made
after the First Effective Time, (B) for customary provisions for the voting by
the Depositary Bank of such Parent Ordinary Shares as instructed by the
holders of the Parent ADSs, (C) for the issuance, at the request of a holder
of Parent ADSs, of either certificated or uncertificated ADRs, (D) subject to
the limitations provided for in General Instruction I.A.1 of Form F-6, that
holders of Parent ADSs shall have the right at any time to exchange their

(the " _Custodian_ ") shall be held by the Custodian for the benefit of the
Depositary Bank, (ii) require the Depositary Bank to forward voting
instructions and other shareholder communications (including notices, reports

following its receipt of such materials, (iii) include customary provisions

distributions or the rights to participate in any rights offerings in each
case received by the Custodian from Parent (or the U.S. dollars available to
the Depositary Bank from the net proceeds of the sale of the foregoing) and
(iv) not permit (x) except as required by applicable Law, any amendment that
prejudices any right of Parent ADS holders or (y) any termination of the
Deposit Agreement by Parent or the Depositary Bank, in the case under _clause
(x)_ or _(y)_ , on less than 30 days notice to holders of Parent ADSs. The
Deposit Agreement shall not provide for (x) any right of Parent to withdraw
Parent Ordinary Shares from the custody account maintained by the Custodian
or (y) any fees to be imposed by the Depositary Bank upon holders of Parent
ADSs in connection with the issuance of Parent ADSs in connection with the
Transaction or the sale or transfer of such Parent ADSs on the NYSE or the
NASDAQ. Parent shall cause the Parent ADSs to be eligible for settlement
through DTC. The material terms of the Deposit Agreement and the Parent ADSs
shall be described in the Form F-4.

 

(b) Parent shall cause (i) the Depositary Bank to issue a number of Parent
ADSs sufficient to constitute the Merger Consideration, (ii) the Parent ADSs
to be issued in connection with the Transactions to be approved for listing on
the NYSE or the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, and (iii) the

subject to the Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs and, where applicable, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared
effective as of the First Effective Time and, to the extent required by
applicable securities Law, to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement covering the Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs (and to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as the Assumed
Options or Assumed RSUs remain outstanding

 

Section 5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees
to cooperate with the other party in taking, or causing to be taken, all
actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and
terminate its registration under the Exchange Act promptly after the First
Effective Time; _provided_ __that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until the First Effective Time. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to file with or furnish to the SEC reports required to be so
filed or furnished under the Exchange Act within the time periods required
under the Exchange Act. If the Final Surviving Company is required to file any
quarterly or annual report by a filing deadline that is imposed by the
Exchange Act and which falls on a date within the ten (10) days following
the Closing Date, the Company shall

 



59

    

 make available to Parent, at or prior to the Closing Date, a substantially
final draft of any such annual or quarterly report reasonably likely to be
required to be filed during such period.

 

Section 5.17 _Intended Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) None of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Company, or their
respective Affiliates shall knowingly take or omit to take any action if such
action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver officers certificates
containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by their respective outside counsel, including on or
prior to the effective date of the Form F-4 and the Closing Date, for purposes
of rendering opinions with respect to the tax treatment of the Mergers (the "
_Tax Representation Letters_ "). Each party hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be
untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause
to be untrue) any portion of the Tax Representation Letters.

(c) Parent shall reasonably promptly notify the Company, and the Company
shall reasonably promptly notify Parent, in each case if such party becomes
aware of any non-public fact or circumstance that would reasonably be likely
to prevent or impede the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment.

(d) If the Company receives the opinion of Kirkland, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, dated as of the Closing Date,
rendered on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in
such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, all of which are consistent
with the state of facts existing as of the Second Effective Time, to the
effect that the Mergers will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, the
parties hereto agree to treat and report the Mergers for all Tax purposes
(including on all applicable Tax Returns) as qualifying for the Intended
Tax Treatment.

(e) In the event that the Mergers would reasonably be expected to fail to
qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, the parties hereto agree (i) to
cooperate in good faith to explore alternative structures that would permit
the transactions contemplated hereby to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) if each party to this
Agreement in the exercise of its reasonable business discretion agrees to
pursue such an alternative structure, the parties hereto shall enter into an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternative structure
and provide for such other changes necessitated thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure of the parties hereto to agree to an alternative
structure shall not cause any condition to Closing set forth herein not to be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any actions taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(e)_
(x) shall not (A) without the consent of the Company and Parent, alter or
change the amount, nature or mix of the Merger Consideration (or the
consideration payable to holders of Options and Company RSUs pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_) or (B) impose any material economic or other costs on
Parent or the Company and (y) shall be capable of consummation without
material delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_, including implementation of an alternative structure
under _Section_ __ _ 5.17(e)_ above, shall not be a condition to Closing or
create any independent conditions to closing.

Section 5.18 _Treatment of Indebtedness_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
7.1_, if and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.18(b)_, provide reasonable cooperation to Parent,
Merger Sub and Merger Sub II in either (i) arranging for the termination of
(x) the indenture listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)(iii)_ of the Company

as agreed to by Parent and the Company), which repayment, redemption, cash
collateralization or providing of "backstop" letters of credit shall be the
sole responsibility of Parent, and the procurement of customary payoff
letters and other customary release documentation in connection therewith or
(ii) obtaining any consents required under any Existing Debt Documents to
permit the consummation of the Transactions thereunder and obtaining any
amendments to or other consents under the Existing Debt Documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Transactions (provided
that, so long as the Company shall have reasonably cooperated in connection
therewith, it shall bear no responsibility for any failure to so obtain such
consents or amendments), including in the case of each of _clauses (_ _i_ _)_
and _(ii)_ , if reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver such customary notices,
agreements, documents or instruments reasonably necessary in connection
therewith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ to the contrary, in
no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its officers,

any out-of-pocket expenses unless they are promptly reimbursed by Parent,
(ii) incur or agree to incur any commitment, tender, consent or amendment fee
or any fee similar to any of the foregoing unless Parent provides the funding
to the Company therefor, (iii) amend, repay, redeem or terminate or agree to
amend, repay, redeem or terminate any Existing Debt Document, which amendment,
repayment, redemption or termination is not conditioned on the Closing, or
provide notice of any redemption, which redemption is not conditioned on the

constitute a default or violation under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of, any
Contract, or (D) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (vi) fund any repayment,
redemption, cash collateralization or provide any "backstop" letters of credit
prior to the Closing, (vii) take, or commit to take, any action to authorize
or approve, or execute or deliver any agreement, certificate or other
document related to the Existing Debt Documents unless (A) such Person will
continue to serve as a director or manager or officer, as the case may be,
after the Closing and (B) the effectiveness of such authorization or approval
or agreement, certificate or other document is expressly made contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing, or (viii) result in any of the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries Representatives incurring any personal liability.
Parent shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from, against and in respect
of any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) resulting from or
incurred in connection with the cooperation required pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.18(a)_ or any information utilized in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.18(a)_ or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it is not a condition to the
Closing that any payoff letters, consents, amendments or other related or
similar actions described in _Section_ __ _ 5.18(a)_ be obtained.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_,
Parents receipt of the Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf of
the Company, together with any amounts paid pursuant to the third and fourth

Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,
general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, assignees or
other Company Representatives for all losses and damages suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ is not subject to (reverse charge) value
added Tax, and shall act in a manner consistent therewith (including filing
Tax Returns consistent therewith and using reasonable best efforts to contest
any contrary position in a Tax audit or similar proceeding). In no event shall
any (reverse charge) value added Tax be deducted from any amount payable
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and no party hereto shall be under any
obligation to reimburse any other party hereto for any (reverse charge) value
added Tax levied from or due by such other party.

termination pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iv)_) or (y) termination of
this Agreement (in the event of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(_ _i_ _))_ , and not abandoned or
withdrawn (which abandonment or withdrawal shall be public if such Parent
Takeover Proposal has been publicly disclosed) prior to (1) the date of the
Parent Shareholders Meeting (in the event of a termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iv)_) or (2) the termination of this Agreement (in the
event of a termination pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(_ _i_ _)_ ) and (iii) within twelve (12) months of the
date this Agreement is terminated, Parent consummates any Parent
Takeover Proposal or enters into a definitive written agreement with respect
to any Parent Takeover Proposal that is subsequently consummated ( _provided_
that for purposes of _clause (iii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_,
the references to "20%" in the definition of "Parent Takeover Proposal" shall
be deemed to be references to "50%"), then Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid as directed by the Company the Termination Fee within two (2) Business
Days following the consummation of such transaction.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable by Parent in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 7.4(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, the
Companys receipt of the Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf of
Parent, together with any amounts paid pursuant to the third and fourth
sentences of _Section_ __ _ 7.4(e)_, shall be the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) against Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including 

 



67

    

 the Merger Subs) and any of their respective former, current or future
direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited partners, controlling
persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, affiliates, assignees or other Parent Representatives for all losses
and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, for any breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
no such Person shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes; _provided_ that
each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
reduce or eliminate the deduction and withholding of any such amounts. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and
that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ do not
constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, Parent shall also pay any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by the Company entitled to such payment in connection with a legal
action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount
against Parent. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
7.4_ shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date paid
at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in _ The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date of such payment. Each of Parent and the Company shall
take the position that any amount payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.4_ is not subject to (reverse charge) value added Tax, and shall act in a
manner consistent therewith (including filing Tax Returns consistent
therewith and using reasonable best efforts to contest any contrary position
in a Tax audit or similar proceeding). In no event shall any (reverse charge)
value added Tax be deducted from any amount payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and no party hereto shall be under any obligation to
reimburse any other party hereto for any (reverse charge) value added Tax
levied from or due by such other party.

irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or

shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to

 



70

    

 prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

including the right of a party hereto to cause the other parties hereto to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in

inequitable for any reason. In the event any party hereto seeks any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, such party shall not be required
to prove damages or obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and each party hereto waives

in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party hereto under this Agreement, including, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (b)
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ shall require any party hereto
to institute any proceeding for (or limit such partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ before
exercising any termination right under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ (or pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any action
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ or anything contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or Parent be
entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the other party to
consummate the Transactions and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee.
