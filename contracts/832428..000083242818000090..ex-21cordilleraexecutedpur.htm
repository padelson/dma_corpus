ARTICLE 2



PURCHASE OF EQUITY INTERESTS



2.1 Purchase of Equity Interests. On the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Closing, Seller shall sell and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase from Seller, the Equity Interests, free and clear of all Liens,
in exchange for the Purchase Price. 





2.2 Purchase Price. At the Closing and subject to Section 2.5, Buyer shall pay
or cause to be paid an aggregate amount equal to Five Hundred Twenty One
Million Dollars ($521,000,000) (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment
as set forth in Section 2.3, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
as follows:



(a) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, which shall be
set forth on the Closing Indebtedness Certificate that Seller shall deliver to
Buyer at least three Business Days before Closing. In order to facilitate such
repayment, prior to the Closing, Seller shall obtain and deliver to Buyer
payoff letters for all



such Indebtedness, which payoff letters shall indicate that the lenders of
such Indebtedness have agreed to release all Liens in respect of such
Indebtedness relating to the Equity Interests or the assets and properties of
the Acquired Companies upon receipt of the amounts indicated in such payoff
letters. Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the amounts and other
information set forth in the Closing Indebtedness Certificate and such payoff
letters.



(b) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Acquired Companies,
all Company Transaction Costs payable by any of the Acquired Companies that
remain outstanding as of the Closing Date, which shall be set forth on the
Closing Transaction Costs Certificate that Seller shall deliver to Buyer at
least three Business Days before Closing, to such account or accounts as are
set forth on the Closing Transaction Costs Certificate. Buyer shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on the amounts and other information set forth
in the Closing Transaction Costs Certificate.



(c) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to an account designated by the Escrow
Agent, the Indemnity Escrow Deposit.



(d) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to an account designated by Seller,
the Purchase Price less the amounts described in Sections 2.2(a), 2.2(b) and
2.2(c) above, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.3.



2.3 Working Capital Adjustment.



(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer an unaudited pro forma estimated balance sheet for the
Acquired Companies, as of the Reference Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet"), together with Seller's good faith estimated, itemized calculation,
based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, of the Net Working Capital
Amount determined as of the Reference Time (the "Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount"). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP. A sample Estimated Closing Balance Sheet prepared as if the Closing
Date was September 30, 2018 is attached hereto as Exhibit F.



(b) At any time prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to
object to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount by delivering written notice of such objection to Seller. If
Buyer does not provide such written notice of objection to Seller, then the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount
shall, subject to and without limiting the remaining provisions of this
Section 2.3, be deemed accepted by Buyer. If, on the other hand, Buyer
provides such written notice of objection to Seller, then representatives of
Buyer and Seller shall meet as promptly as practicable to discuss in good
faith the proper Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the proper Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount; provided, however, that if such representatives of
Buyer and Seller are unable to agree in good faith prior to the Closing Date
on the proper Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the proper Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, then the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount shall be
deemed to be equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount as presented by
Seller, subject to and without limiting the remaining provisions of this
Section 2.3.



(c) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount if the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is a
positive number, and (ii) decreased by the absolute value of the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, if the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is a
negative number.

 (d) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller an unaudited balance sheet for the
Acquired Companies determined as of the Reference Time (the "Reviewed Closing
Balance Sheet"), together with an itemized calculation, based on the Reviewed
Closing Balance Sheet, of the Net Working Capital Amount determined as of the
Reference Time (the "Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount"). The Reviewed
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same
accounting principles, policies and methods as were used by Seller in
preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet in connection with the
calculation of each of the line items reflected thereon.







(e) If Seller disagrees with the Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet or Buyer's
calculation of the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount, then during the thirty
(30) days following the date of Seller's receipt of the Reviewed Closing
Balance Sheet, Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall each provide Seller with
access to the working papers of Buyer and the Acquired Companies relating to
the Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet and the resulting calculation of the
Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount, as well as any other information used in
preparing the Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet as is reasonably requested by
Seller; provided, that such access shall be in a manner that does not
interfere with the normal business operations of Buyer or any of the Acquired
Companies. The Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet and the resulting calculation of
the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount shall become final and binding and
deemed accepted by Seller at the end of such thirty (30) day period unless,
prior to the end of such period, Seller has delivered to Buyer written notice
of its disagreement with such Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet and the resulting
calculation of the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount (a "Disagreement
Notice"), specifying the nature and amount of any disputed item.



(f) In the event that any Disagreement Notice is timely provided to Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.3(e), Buyer and Seller shall cooperate for a period of
thirty (30) days following Buyer's receipt of the Disagreement Notice (or such
longer period as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements set forth in the Disagreement Notice with respect to the
Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet and the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount.
If, at the end of such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve all such disagreements with respect to the Reviewed Closing Balance
Sheet or the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount, then a mutually acceptable,
nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not then have a
relationship with Seller or Buyer (the "Independent Accountant") shall be
engaged to resolve such remaining disagreements with respect to the Reviewed
Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount;
provided, however, that if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the choice
of such firm within 10 Business Days following the end of such 30 day period,
then such firm will be a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by lot
(after Seller and Buyer shall have each submitted two proposed firms and then
excluded one firm designated by the other party). Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Independent Accountant to determine as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which such dispute is
referred to the Independent Accountant, whether and to what extent the
Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount
requires adjustment; provided, however, that the Independent Accountant shall
be authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between Buyer
and Seller as specified in the Disagreement Notice, in each case within the
range of the difference between Buyer's position with respect thereto and
Seller's position with respect thereto. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant (including any indemnity obligations to the Independent
Accountant) shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller based on their
relative success with respect to the disputed items (as finally determined by
the Independent Accountant). The fees and expenses (if any) of Buyer's
independent auditors and attorneys incurred in connection with the review of
the Disagreement Notice shall be borne by Buyer, and the fees and expenses (if
any) of Seller's independent auditors and attorneys incurred in connection
with their review of the Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount shall be borne by
Seller.



(g) The "Final Net Working Capital Amount" shall be equal to (i) the Reviewed
Net Working Capital Amount, in the event that Seller does not provide a
Disagreement Notice to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided for in
Section 2.3(e) or (ii) the as-adjusted Reviewed Net Working Capital Amount as
determined by the parties or the Independent Accountant pursuant to Section
2.3(f), in the event that Seller provides a Disagreement Notice to Buyer
within the thirty (30) day period provided for in Section 2.3(e). The Final
Net Working Capital Amount shall be set forth on the "Final Closing Balance
Sheet", which shall be (x) the Reviewed Closing Balance Sheet in the event
that Seller does not provide a Disagreement Notice to Buyer within the thirty
(30) day period provided for in Section 2.3(e) or (y) the as-adjusted Reviewed
Closing Balance Sheet as determined by the parties or the Independent Accountant pursuant to Section 2.3(f), in the event that Seller provides a
Disagreement Notice to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided for in
Section 2.3(e).



(h) If the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the Final Net
Working Capital Amount, then the difference between the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount, minus the Final Net Working Capital Amount shall be referred
to as a "Reviewed Net Working Capital Shortfall". If the Final Net Working
Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, then
the difference between the Final Net Working Capital Amount, minus the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount shall be referred to as a "Reviewed Net
Working Capital Overage".



(i) The "Final Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to either the
Reviewed Net Working Capital Shortfall or the Reviewed Net Working Capital
Overage, as applicable. In the event that the Final Adjustment Amount is a
Reviewed Net Working Capital Shortfall, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
such amount and Seller shall pay such amount to Buyer by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. In the event
that the Final Adjustment Amount is a Reviewed Net Working Capital Overage,
the Purchase Price shall be increased by such amount and Buyer shall pay such
amount to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account(s) designated by Seller.



(j) Any payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.3(i) shall be (i) made
within five

(5) days of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to
Section 2.3(i) and

(ii) treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.



2.4 Closing.



(a) Subject to any prior termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1, the consummation of the sale and purchase of the Equity Interests
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Cooley LLP located at 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington D.C. 20004 on
(i) the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date that is the later of (x) the
date on which the FCC Consent shall have been granted and shall be in full
force and effect, and (y) the date on which the HSR Clearance has been
obtained, or (ii) such other date or at such other location as is mutually
agreed to by Buyer and Seller in writing (as applicable, the "Closing Date"),
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth
herein (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at
the Closing); provided, that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior
to the time the Closing would have otherwise been required to occur pursuant
to the foregoing, the Closing shall not occur until the third Business Day
following the final day of the Marketing Period, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth herein (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing).



(b) A breach by a party of its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, including this
Section 2.4, shall be subject to Section 12.1(b) or Section 12.1(c), as
applicable (and shall not be subject to the Cure Period under Section 12.2).



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the Closing shall be effective at 12:01
a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date.



2.5 Governmental Consents.



(a) Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies to, jointly file
an application or applications with the FCC requesting the grant of its
consent to the transfer of control of the Acquired Companies from Seller to
Buyer (collectively, the "FCC Application"). Any FCC filing fees relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Buyer
and one-half (1/2) by Seller, irrespective of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated. To the extent applicable, Buyer shall
include in the FCC Application an exhibit requesting that the FCC grant
continued satellite status for the Stations currently operating as satellite
stations under FCC rules. Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise
use their

 reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as practicable.
Seller and Buyer each shall oppose any petitions to deny or other objections
filed with respect to the FCC Application to the extent such petition or
objection relates to such party. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, and Seller
shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, take any intentional action which
would, or intentionally fail to take such action the failure of which to take
would, reasonably be expected to materially delay, materially impede or
prevent receipt of the grant of the FCC Consent.



(b) If applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall make any required filings with the FTC and
the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including a request for early termination of the waiting period
thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received
from such agencies for additional information or documentation and otherwise
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (the "HSR Clearance"). Any
filing fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2)
by Seller, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated.



(c) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
under Section 12.1, Buyer and Seller shall jointly request an extension period
of the FCC Consent. No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the rights of
either party under Section 12.1.

addition to the other covenants set forth in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to
take promptly any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust or competition Law
(including the HSR Act) or any Communications Law that may be required by the
FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal,
state or local governmental authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or
competition governmental authority, in each case having competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including
committing to or effecting, by consent decree, pocket consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise, such divestitures of the Stations (each,
a "Divestiture") as are required in order to obtain the FCC Consent or the HSR
Clearance and to avoid the entry of (or to effect the dissolution of or vacate
or lift) any order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.5(d), if
any of the consents or approvals (or elimination of impediments) contemplated
by the preceding sentence have not been obtained (or eliminated), in each case
as of the date that is six (6) months following the date hereof, and if
Seller, after consultation with Buyer, reasonably determines in good faith,
or, if at any time after the date hereof, the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state
Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local governmental
authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition governmental
authority, has indicated, that a Divestiture is required to obtain the FCC
Consent or the HSR Clearance, or otherwise to remove any impediment or to
obtain any required consents under any antitrust or competition Law or under
the Communications Laws in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then Seller shall have the right to provide
written notice of such determination or indication to Buyer (a "Divestiture
Notice"). Upon receipt of a Divestiture Notice, Buyer shall promptly (and in
all respects prior to the Outside Date) implement or cause to be implemented
such Divestiture. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall take
any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for
any non-action, consent or approval of the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state
Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local governmental
authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition governmental
authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to
any antitrust or competition Law or any Communications Law would preclude
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before
the Outside Date.



(e) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 2.5 with
respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Buyer and Seller
shall (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material

all documents filed with, submitted to or received from any Governmental

in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before any
Governmental Entity relating to this Agreement, the Stations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any claim, suit, action,
complaint, charge, or arbitration proceeding initiated by a private party.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, (x) shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with each
other on, all information that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement, the Stations or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) shall
give the other a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in meetings
and telephone conferences with any such Governmental Entity relating to the
foregoing. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall file any amendment to the FCC
Application or, after grant of the FCC Consent, request any modification of
the FCC Consent without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



2.6 Withholding. Buyer or its designee and each Acquired Company shall be
entitled to withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Person is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. The applicable
withholding agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or
eliminate any such withholding including by requesting any appropriate Tax
forms, including IRS Form W-9 or any similar information from Seller. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing

all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

will have as of the Closing Date, sufficient funds available to pay the
Purchase Price in full.



4.8 No Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other third
party has been employed or retained by Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or is or may be entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or
the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Buyer.



4.9 Securities Laws. Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
with such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as are
necessary in order to evaluate the merits and risks in an investment in the
Equity Interests. The Equity Interests to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement shall be acquired for Buyer's own account and not with a view
to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities Laws. Buyer is able to bear the economic
risk of its investment in the Equity Interests for an indefinite period of
time and acknowledges that the Equity Interests have not been registered under
the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be sold unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available.

(a) As of the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall, or Buyer shall
cause the applicable Acquired Company to continue to, employ each Station
Employee who (i) is not then on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short
or long term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights
("Active Employees") or (ii) is then on authorized leave of absence, sick
leave, short-term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall
rights and who returns to active employment immediately following such absence
and within six (6) months of the Closing Date, or such later date as required

applicable Buyer Benefit Plans.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement is not intended to
create a contract between Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
on the one hand and any Station Employee on the other hand, and no Station
Employee may rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of contract
claim against Buyer, Seller or any Acquired Company, (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed or construed to require Buyer or any Acquired
Company to employ any particular Station Employee for any period after the

or the right of Buyer or any Acquired Company to terminate the employment of
any Continuing Employee during any period after the Closing Date.



(d) In the event that Buyer terminates the employment of any Continuing
Employee on or after the Closing, Buyer shall be solely responsible to pay
such Continuing Employee any severance or other compensation due, whether by
Contract or law, on account of such termination; provided, however, that this
Section 6.4(d) shall not limit in any respect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or indemnities of Seller contained in this Agreement.



(e) Effective as of the Closing Date or the payroll period ending immediately
after the Closing Date, Seller or the Acquired Companies shall have
contributed to the existing tax-qualified defined contribution plan
established or designated by Seller ("Seller's 401(k) Plan") all matching or
other employer contributions, if any, with respect to the Continuing
Employees' employment service rendered prior to the Closing Date (irrespective
of any end-of-year service requirements otherwise applicable to such
contributions) and, to the extent required by Law, cause the matching and
other employer contribution amounts of all Continuing Employees under the
Seller's 401(k) Plan to become fully vested as of the Closing Date. Prior to
and following the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to ensure that under the terms of the Seller's 401(k) Plan, each
Continuing Employee with an account balance is eligible to receive a
distribution as a result of the Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall permit the Continuing Employees who participate in Seller's 401(k) Plan
to elect to make direct rollovers of their account balances (including any
outstanding loan balances) into a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
established or designated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates ("Buyer's 401(k)
Plan") as of the Closing (or as soon as practicable thereafter when Buyer's
401(k) Plan is capable of accepting such rollovers), subject to compliance
with applicable Law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyer's
401(k) Plan. Such rollovers will be permitted by Buyer only if they consist of
the total account balance of the Continuing Employee. Further, only rollovers
of cash and outstanding loans may be transferred to Buyer's 401(k) Plan; and
provided, further, that with respect to any loan balance transferred, subject to applicable Law and any required consent of individuals, any such
loans may be reamortized to reflect any differences in payroll periods.



(f) Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical,
life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for

Commencement Date, (ii) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements
or pre-existing condition limitations and (iii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts
paid by such Continuing Employees (and their covered dependents) under the
Buyer Benefit Plans.



(g) Effective as of Closing, Seller shall cause WLEX Communications, LLC to
terminate its Health Plan, effective as of the Closing, and Seller shall cause
sufficient advance notice to be given to the insurance carrier(s) such that
termination may occur without penalty or claim of breach.

to recognize as of the Closing all liabilities for unpaid, accrued vacation or
PTO of each Continuing Employee as of the Employment Commencement Date, giving
service credit under the PTO policy of Buyer for service with the Acquired
Companies, and shall permit Continuing Employees to use their accrued, but
unused vacation/PTO entitlement as of Closing in accordance with Buyer's PTO
policy. Three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
Schedule 6.4(h) to Buyer, which shall set forth the liabilities of the

accountants, and other authorized agents and representatives, at Seller's sole

access may be reasonably required by Seller (i) to facilitate the
investigation, litigation and final disposition of any claims which have been
made in writing against Seller by any third-party (not including Buyer or any
of its Affiliates) or (ii) for the preparation of Tax Returns and audits,
provided in each case that such access does not unreasonably disrupt or
interfere with the Business or the business and operations of Buyer or the
Acquired Companies. Seller agrees that any information or material accessed,
copied, extracted or possessed by Seller under this Section 6.5 shall be
Information covered by Section 6.1(b).



6.6 Cooperation; Financial Statements.



(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller
to release any Liens applicable to the Acquired Companies, provided that Buyer
shall not be required to incur any cost, expense or other liability in
connection therewith. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may use a portion of the
proceeds from the Purchase Price for the repayment of Indebtedness associated
with any such Liens pursuant to Section 2.2(a).



(b) Without limiting Section 5.4, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, provide, on a timely basis and at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
such cooperation and assistance as Buyer may reasonably request in connection
with (i) the arrangement of any financing for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) the preparation of financial statements for the
Acquired Companies or the Business for any fiscal period.

 (c) Prior to the Closing, but after January 15, 2019, Seller shall have
delivered to Buyer copies of the audited consolidated balance sheets and
statements of operations for EPI Preferred, LLC, Seller and the Subsidiaries
as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, September 30, 2017
and September 30, 2016 (the "Audited Financial Statements"). Seller hereby
consents to the inclusion of the Audited Financial Statements and related
information, as applicable, following the Closing in (i) the Current Report on
Form 8-K required to be filed by Buyer's parent, The E.W. Scripps Company
("EWS"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any
registration statement filed by EWS in connection with an offering or exchange
of securities on Form S-1, Form S-4 or Form S-8 (or any successor forms) under
the Securities Act in compliance with the requirements of Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K, as applicable, and (iii) any prospectuses, private placement
memoranda, lender and investor presentations, offering documents, bank
information memoranda, rating agency presentations and similar documents
customarily used in connection with any debt or equity financing of Buyer or
EWS. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent
auditors, at such time or times as Buyer shall reasonably request, to provide
signed consents to the inclusion of unqualified auditors' reports in the
aforesaid registration statements and to references therein to such auditors
as experts, which such consents may be filed with the SEC in connection with
such registration statements.







(d) Following the Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
permit Buyer and its Affiliates to prepare such unaudited pro forma financial
statements for the Business for such time periods as required by the Exchange
Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC or any rule or regulation of any
securities exchange upon which the securities of EWS are listed or traded.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, at Buyer's
sole cost and expense, (i) provide Buyer and its accountants with reasonable
access during normal business hours to financial and other information
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation of such
financial statements, including access to work papers of Seller and its
accountants reasonably requested by Buyer in connection therewith and (ii)
provide reasonable assistance to Buyer and its accountants in the preparation
of such financial statements.



(e) Buyer shall, within 10 days of request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller
for any action taken by it or its accountants pursuant to Section 6.6(c) or
Section 6.6(d); provided, however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to
reimburse Seller for any costs or expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with the audit for Seller's fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 or the
preparation and audit of financial statements for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2018 except to the extent that Seller's independent accountant
performing such audit charges Seller additional costs or fees to perform
additional audit procedures solely in connection with such audited financial
statements being included any document referred in Section 6.6(c)(i), (ii) or
(iii).



6.7 Interim Reports. Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each
calendar month during the period from the Balance Sheet Date through the
Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer, with respect to the Acquired Companies
and the Stations, the unaudited balance sheet as of the end of such month and
the related combined unaudited statement of operations for such month ended of
the Acquired Companies and the Stations. Such reports shall be prepared on the
same basis as the Financial Statements. Seller shall also provide to Buyer
weekly pacing reports for each of the Stations promptly following the end of
each week during the period from the date hereof through the Closing.



6.8 Fulfillment of Conditions. Without limiting any other obligation of a
party expressly set forth herein, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy each of the conditions to the Closing of Buyer set forth in
ARTICLE 8 (Buyer Closing Conditions), and Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy each of the conditions to the Closing of Seller
set forth in ARTICLE 7 (Seller Closing Conditions), and each of the parties
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action necessary or desirable in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.



6.9 Title Commitments; Surveys. Buyer shall have the responsibility to obtain,
if it so elects at its sole option and expense, (a) commitments for owner's
and lender's title insurance policies on the Owned Real Property and
commitments for lessee's and lender's title insurance policies for all Real
Property that is leased pursuant to a Real Property Lease (collectively, the
"Title Commitments"), and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property
(the "Surveys"); provided, however, that Seller shall provide Buyer with any
existing Title Commitments, title policies and Surveys in its possession or
control. The Title Commitments will evidence a commitment to issue an ALTA
title insurance policy insuring good, marketable and indefeasible fee simple (or
leasehold, if applicable) title to each parcel of the Real Property
contemplated above for such amount as Buyer directs. Seller shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in obtaining
such Title Commitments and Surveys, provided that neither Seller nor any
Acquired Company shall be required to incur any cost, expense or other
liability in connection therewith. If the Title Commitments or Surveys reveal
any Lien on the title or Real Property other than Permitted Liens, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing of such objectionable matter promptly after Buyer
becomes aware that such matter is not a Permitted Lien, and Seller agrees to,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to remove such objectionable matter.





6.10 No Negotiation. Until the earlier of the Closing or such time as this
Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 12.1, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and its and
their respective managers, directors, officers, investment bankers and agents
not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, encourage, entertain,
consider or accept any inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person (other
than Buyer) or (b) discuss, negotiate or communicate with, provide any
information to, or enter into any agreements or other instruments with, any
Person (other than Buyer) in each case relating to (i) any acquisition or
purchase of the Equity Interests (or other securities or ownership interests
of any Acquired Company), (ii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, amalgamation, recapitalization, reorganization or similar
transaction involving any Acquired Company, (iii) any sale, lease, license,
exchange or other disposition of all or a signification portion of the assets
of any Acquired Company, the Business or any of the Stations, or (iv) other
similar transaction involving any Acquired Company, the Business or any
Station. Seller immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Seller shall notify Buyer promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any
inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and
shall, in any such notice to Buyer, indicate in reasonable detail the identity
of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the terms
and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. Seller
agrees not to, and to cause the Acquired Companies not to, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, release any Person from, or waive any provision of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Seller (solely to the
extent related to the Business) or any Acquired Company is a party.



6.11 Officers and Directors Indemnification; Insurance Tail Coverage.



(a) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the indemnification
agreements set forth on Schedule 6.11(a) shall remain in effect from and after
the Closing for a period of six (6) years but only to the extent related to
actions or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause,
for a period of at least six (6) years from Closing, the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of managers,
directors and officers from and against liabilities arising prior to the
Closing than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Companies as
of the date hereof, except as required by any applicable Law.



(b) EPI Group, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company and parent of
Seller ("EPI Group"), shall maintain its existing directors and officers,
employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policies for six (6)
years from the Closing Date, and its existing cybersecurity, privacy and media
liability insurance policies for three (3) years from the Closing Date, in
each case, that name the Acquired Companies as named insureds thereunder with
respect to the periods prior to the Closing, in each case without reducing the
scope thereof, including retention and limits of coverage. For the sake of
clarification, the intent of this Section 6.11(b) is to keep in effect the
aforesaid policies, covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date, for the benefit of the Acquired Companies and those directors, officers
and managers of the Acquired Companies who are currently covered by such
policies, as applicable.



(c) The provisions of Section 6.11(a) and Section 6.11(b) are (i) intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each individual who on or
prior to the Closing Date was a director, manager or officer of the Acquired
Companies (each, an "Indemnitee"), his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11 and (ii) in addition to, not in
substitution for, any other right to indemnification or contribution that any
such Indemnitee may have under contract or otherwise. Following the Closing,
in the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) shall enter into any merger, consolidation or similar transaction,
Buyer shall make proper provision so that the surviving or resulting entity
will assume the obligations imposed by Section 6.11(a). Following the Closing,
in the event that EPI Group shall enter into any merger, consolidation, sale
of substantially all of the assets then owned by it or any similar
transaction, EPI Group shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy with coverage
for (i) its existing directors and officers, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policies for the period remaining
from the closing of any such transaction and six (6) years from the Closing
Date and (ii) its existing cybersecurity, privacy and media liability
insurance policies for the period remaining from the closing of any such
transaction and three (3) years from the Closing Date, in each case that name
the Acquired Companies as named insureds thereunder with respect to the
periods prior to the Closing.



(d) The obligations of Buyer and EPI Group under this Section 6.11 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.11 applies without the consent of the
affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.11, and each Indemnitee may specifically enforce the terms of this Section
6.11).



(e) EPI Group's insurance policies written on an "occurrence basis" and
insuring the Acquired Companies shall provide insurance coverage to the extent
the events giving rise to any claim occurred prior to 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date. EPI Group shall cooperate with Buyer in asserting claims under
such policies in connection with insurable events and by executing appropriate
assignments as permitted by Law. EPI Group shall remit any recoveries
thereunder promptly to Buyer; provided, that any such remitted recoveries
shall reduce Buyer's Losses with respect to any claim related to such
occurrence.





6.12 Termination of Related Party Transactions. Seller shall, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies to, terminate, without liability to the Acquired
Companies or Buyer, all Related Party Transactions prior to the Closing and
all such Related Party Transactions shall be deemed to be terminated in all
respects (notwithstanding anything therein relating to the survival of any
provisions thereof) effective as of the Closing without any further action by
the parties thereto or the parties hereto and without any adverse Tax
consequences to the Acquired Companies. To the extent that any Acquired
Company is a party to any guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond or similar
instrument, each such arrangement shall be released prior to Closing, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.



6.13 Multi-Station Contracts. Schedule 6.13 contains a list as of the date
hereof of Contracts to which one or more television stations of Seller, Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Stations) (each, an "Other Seller
Station") is party to, or has rights or obligations thereunder (any such
Contract, a "Multi-Station Contract"). The rights and obligations under the
Multi-Station Contracts to be allocated to the Acquired Companies shall
include only those rights and obligations under such Multi-Station Contracts
that are applicable to the Stations. The rights of each Other Seller Station
with respect to such Multi-Station Contracts and the obligations of each Other
Seller Station to such Multi-Station Contracts shall not be allocated to the
Acquired Companies. For purposes of determining the scope of the rights and
obligations of the Multi-Station Contracts, the rights and obligations under
each Multi-Station Contract shall be equitably allocated among (1) the
Stations, on the one hand, and (2) the Other Seller Stations, on the other
hand, in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles:



(a) any allocation set forth in the Multi-Station Contract shall control; or



(b) if there is no allocation as described in clause (a) hereof, then
reasonable accommodation (to be determined by mutual good faith agreement of
Seller and Buyer) shall control. Subject to any applicable third-party
consents, such allocation and assignment with respect to any Multi- Station
Contract shall be effectuated, as mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer, by
termination of such Multi-Station Contract in its entirety with respect to the
Stations and the execution of new contracts with respect to the Stations or by
an assignment to and assumption by the applicable Acquired Company of the
related rights and obligations under such Multi-Station Contract. The parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such new contracts or
assignments to, and assumptions by, the Acquired Companies in accordance with
this Section 6.13; provided, that, completion of documentation of any such
allocation under this Section 6.13 is not a condition to Closing.



6.14 Non-Solicitation. For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date,
none of Seller nor its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) shall,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire (whether as an
employee, consultant or otherwise) any employee of Buyer or its Affiliates or
any Acquired Company immediately prior to Closing; provided that Seller and
its Affiliates shall not be precluded from soliciting or hiring, or taking any
other action with respect to any such person who responds to general or public
solicitation not targeted at employees of Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies. 



6.15 Mail and Other Communications. After the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, promptly remit to Buyer any checks, cash, payments,
material mail or other material communications directed to any Acquired
Company, the Business or any properties or assets of any Acquired Company that
are received by Seller or any Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date.



6.16 Joint Privilege. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product and expectation of client
confidence involving general business matters of the Acquired Companies and
arising prior to the Closing for the benefit of both Seller and any Acquired
Company shall be subject to a joint privilege between Seller, on the one hand,
and the Acquired Company, on the other hand, and Seller and the Acquired
Company shall have equal right to assert all such joint privilege and
protection and no such joint privilege may be waived by (a) Seller without the
prior written consent of Buyer on behalf of the Acquired Company or (b) the
Acquired Company without the prior written consent of Seller.





6.17 Environmental Assessments; Phase I Investigations.



(a) Within thirty (30) days from the date of this Agreement (the "Phase I Time
Period"), Buyer shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to engage
an environmental consulting firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Assessment
and Compliance Review, as such terms are commonly understood ("Phase I
Environmental Assessment") with respect to any Owned Real Property provided
such environmental assessment, investigation or review shall be conducted only
(i) during regular business hours, (ii) with no less than two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to Seller, and (iii) in a manner which will not
unduly interfere with the operation of the Business or the use of access to or
egress from the Owned Real Property. Any damage to the Owned Real Property
caused by Buyer and its consultants in conducting any such environmental
assessment, investigation or review shall be repaired by Buyer at its sole
cost and expense.



(b) If any Phase I Environmental Assessment details a Recognized Environmental
Condition (as such term is defined in the ASTM Standard for Phase I
Environmental Assessments) (a "Recognized Environmental Condition") in respect
of any Owned Real Property, the environmental consultant recommends in the
Phase I Environmental Assessment a Phase II Environmental Assessment ("Phase
II Environmental Assessment"), and Buyer makes a request in writing to Seller
within five Business Days following expiration of the Phase I Time Period to
conduct such Phase II Environmental Assessment (a "Phase II Request"), then
Seller shall have the right, by written notice to Buyer within 10 days after
receipt of the Phase II Request (the "Phase II Election Notice"), to: (i)
propose an alternative method for handling the risk of the Recognized
Environmental Condition; or (ii) agree in principle to the Phase II Request (a
"Phase II Consent"). In the event Seller elects option (i) of this Section
6.17(b), the parties shall use their respective good faith efforts to reach an
agreement in writing with respect to such alternative method, and such
agreement, if any, shall be binding upon the parties. If the parties cannot
reach such an agreement within 10 days after Buyer's receipt of the Phase II
Election Notice, Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
Seller within five Business Days after the expiration of such 10-day period
unless Seller, by written notice to Buyer within such five-Business Day
period, agrees in principle to the Phase II Request (which shall also be
deemed a "Phase II Consent" hereunder). In the event Seller provides Buyer
with a Phase II Consent pursuant to this Section, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than 10 days
after Buyer's receipt of the Phase II Consent, a copy of the proposed work
plan, which shall be commercially reasonable, for the Phase II Environmental
Assessment, and the parties shall use their respective good faith efforts to
reach an agreement in writing with respect to the scope of such Phase II
Environmental Assessment. If the parties cannot reach such an agreement within
10 days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's proposed work plan, then Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller within five Business Days
after the expiration of such 10-day period unless Seller, by written notice to
Buyer prior to the expiration of such five-Business Day period, agrees to the
work plan proposed by Buyer. If the parties reach an agreement pursuant to
this Section with respect to the scope of the Phase II Environmental
Assessment (such agreed upon scope of the Phase II Environmental Assessment,
the "Phase II Inspection"), Buyer shall have the right, within 30 days
following the date upon which the parties reach such agreement (the "Phase II
Time Period"), to conduct, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, the Phase II
Inspection; provided such Phase II Inspection shall be conducted only (A)
during regular business hours, (B) with no less than two (2) Business Days
prior written notice to Seller, and (C) in a manner which will not unduly
interfere with the operation of the Business or the use of access to or egress
from the Owned Real Property. Any damage to the Owned Real Property caused by
Buyer and its consultants in conducting any Phase II Inspection shall be repaired by Buyer at its sole
cost and expense. The Phase I Environmental Assessment and Phase II
Environmental Assessment are hereinafter referred to as the "Assessments".



(c) Promptly upon its receipt thereof, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of
the environmental consultant's report generated in connection with the Phase
II Inspection (the "Phase II Report"), which shall include, if applicable, an
estimate of the cost and expense of further investigation, clean up, removal,
remedial, corrective or responsive action necessary to address the Recognized
Environmental Condition (the "Environmental Work"); provided, however, the
Environmental Work shall be designed to meet the least stringent standards or
requirements so as to cause the Recognized Environmental Condition not to be a
violation under applicable Environmental Law. In the event the Phase II Report
recommends Environmental Work, then (i) Seller, by written notice to Buyer
within ten

(10) Business Days after the expiration of the Phase II Time Period, may (A)
elect to cause such Environmental Work to be performed prior to the Closing at
Seller's sole cost and expense, (B) provide Buyer with a purchase price
reduction for the estimated cost of such Environmental Work or (C) if the
estimated cost of such Environmental Work exceeds Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) terminate this Agreement (provided that if
Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to this clause (C), Seller shall pay
to Buyer an amount equal to the costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with this Agreement, including the costs of conducting the
Assessments), or (ii) Buyer, if Seller does not make a timely election
pursuant to the preceding clause (i), may (A) elect to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the
expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period or (B) proceed to close the
transaction with Seller indemnifying Buyer against any Losses related to the
Environmental Work.



(d) Buyer shall pay all the costs and expenses of any Phase I Environmental
Assessment and any Phase II Environmental Assessment regardless of whether
this Agreement is terminated or closed. Seller and Buyer agree that the
results of the Assessments carried out pursuant to this Section 6.17 shall not
be disclosed to any third party, unless such disclosure is required by Law or
is made in connection with any Action between the parties relating to this
Section 6.17; provided, however, that each party may disclose such information
to such party's officers, directors, employees, lenders, advisors, attorneys,
Debt Financing Sources and accountants who need to know such information in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and who are informed by such party of the confidential nature of
such information.



(e) If the Closing is not consummated hereunder, neither party shall have any
obligation to remediate any potential liability with respect to the results of
such Assessments. Any damage to the Real Property caused by Buyer and its
consultants in conducting any Assessment shall be repaired by Buyer at its
sole cost and expense. Any such Environmental Work required under this Section
6.17 shall entail a reasonably cost-effective method necessary so as to cause
the Recognized Environmental Condition not to be a violation under applicable
Environmental Law. In the event that Seller elects to withhold consent for any
Phase II Environmental Assessment, Buyer, at its option, may (1) terminate
this Agreement by written notice to the other party without further liability
or (2) proceed to close the transaction with Seller indemnifying Buyer against
any Losses directly related to facts that would have been discovered in such
Phase II Environmental Assessment, including any Environmental Work.



6.18 Satellite Matter. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to the provisions of
Schedule 6.18, which is hereby incorporated by reference



6.19 Tower Matter. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to the provisions of Schedule
6.19, which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Closing Date, other than (i) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.1, Section 3.2, and Section 3.18, which shall survive until 60 days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
any extension thereof, whether automatic or permissive), and (ii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5, which shall survive
until 180 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extension thereof, whether automatic or
permissive). The covenants and agreements of Seller and Buyer to be performed
in whole or in part after Closing shall survive the Closing until performed in
full in accordance with their respective terms. Claims for indemnification
under Section 10.2(a)(iii) or Section 10.2(a)(iv) shall survive the Closing
until 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extension thereof, whether automatic or
permissive). Seller and Buyer shall not have any liability under Sections 10.2
and 10.3, respectively, unless a claim for Losses for which indemnification is
sought thereunder is asserted by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, within
the applicable survival period set forth above; provided, however, that the
good faith written assertion of any such claim by a party against the other
party hereunder prior to the applicable survival period set forth above shall
extend the survival period with respect to such claim through the date such
claim is conclusively resolved.



10.2 Indemnification by Seller.



(a) Subject to the limitations, conditions and provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE 10, after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) and
their respective partners, shareholders, members, officers, directors,
managers, employees and other representatives (each a "Buyer Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and
against and with respect to, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by, or imposed upon, any such Buyer
Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of, or relating to (i) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on
behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by Seller to
perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, (iii)
any Company Transaction Costs or Indebtedness of any Acquired Company outstanding as of the Closing to the extent not deducted from
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2, and (iv) that matter listed on
Schedule 10.2(a)(iv).



(b) Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 10.2(a) shall be subject to the following limitations and provisions,
as applicable:



(i) Seller's obligations to indemnify Buyer and each Acquired Company with
respect to Seller Taxes as set forth in Section 11.1(a) are solely as set
forth in Section 11.1, which shall be separate and distinct from (but not
duplicative of any Losses indemnified pursuant to) the provisions of this
ARTICLE 10 and such indemnification obligations for Seller Taxes shall not be
subject to Section 10.2(b)(ii) or Section 10.2(b)(iii)(A), but shall be
subject to Section 10.2(b)(iii)(B), Section 10.2(b)(iii)(C) and Section
10.2(c).



(ii) No indemnification shall be required to be made by Seller under Section
10.2(a)(i) with respect to any claims for Losses thereunder until the
aggregate amount of all of the Buyer Indemnified Parties' Losses under Section
10.2(a)(i) exceeds Two Million Six Hundred Five Thousand Dollars ($2,605,000)
(the "Deductible Amount"), in which case Seller shall then be liable
thereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Parties only for such Losses in excess of
the Deductible Amount; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in
this Section 10.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out
of, or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.5 or Section 3.18 or claims
for fraud.



(iii) After the Closing:



(A) the Buyer Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses
arising under Section 10.2(a)(i) shall be a claim for indemnification against
the Indemnity Escrow Funds for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification from Seller pursuant to Section 10.2, which shall
constitute a cap on the maximum total liability of Seller arising under
Section 10.2(a)(i); provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this
Section 10.2(b)(iii)(A) shall not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out
of, or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.5, or Section
3.18 or claims for fraud;



(B) prior to the date that is the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the
Closing Date and so long as any Indemnity Escrow Funds remain available, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall first make claims for indemnification against
the Indemnity Escrow Funds for any Losses (including Losses arising under
Section 10.2(a)(i) relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section
3.5, or Section 3.18, arising under Sections 10.2(a)(ii), (a)(iii) or (a)(iv),
or arising under Section 11.1(a)); and



(C) the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable
arising under Section 10.2(a)(i) relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3,
Section 3.5, or Section 3.18, arising under Sections 10.2(a)(ii), (a)(iii) and
(a)(iv) and collectively for all Losses under Section 10.2(a), and arising
under Section 11.1(a), together with all other Losses of Buyer under this
Agreement, shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price, which shall in all
cases constitute a cap on the total maximum liability of Seller under this
Agreement.



(iv) For purposes of this ARTICLE 10, solely for the purpose of calculating
the amount of any Losses arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement
(and not for determining the existence of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement), the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect.



(c) Seller, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver, at or prior
to the Closing, an Indemnity Escrow Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E, with such changes as Seller and Buyer may
reasonably agree that are consistent with this Agreement (the "Indemnity
Escrow Agreement"), in accordance with which, on the Closing Date, pursuant to
Section 2.2, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal
to Twenty-Six Million Fifty Thousand Dollars ($26,050,000) (the "Indemnity
Escrow Deposit") (all amounts held from time to time by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement in respect of such deposit,
including any interest or other earnings in respect of such deposit, the
"Indemnity Escrow Funds"). The Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the following
provision: no later than the second Business Day after the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds not
then subject to outstanding indemnification claims by any Buyer Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be released by the Escrow Agent to
Seller. In connection with the release of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Funds pursuant to this Section 10.2(c), Seller and Buyer shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to make the
payments set forth in this Section 10.2(c).



10.3 Indemnification by Buyer.



(a) Subject to the limitations, conditions and provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE 10, after Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller
and its partners, shareholders, members, officers, directors and employees, as
the case may be (each a "Seller Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and against and with respect to,
and shall reimburse any of them for, any and all Losses suffered by such
Seller Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer made, or any failure by
Buyer to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth, in this
Agreement.



(b) Buyer's obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) shall be subject to all of the following limitations:



(i) Buyer's obligation to indemnify Seller with respect to any Losses set
forth in Section 11.1(b) are solely as set forth in Section 11.1(b), which
shall be separate and distinct from the provisions of this ARTICLE 10, and not
be subject to this Section 10.3.



(ii) After the Closing, the Seller Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive
remedy for any Losses (whether such Losses result from a claim framed in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the other Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby shall be a claim for indemnification from Buyer pursuant to this
Section 10.3.





10.4 Procedure for Indemnification. The procedure for indemnification pursuant
to this ARTICLE 10 and SECTION 11.1 (except to the extent of a conflict with
Section 11.8, in which case Section 11.8 shall govern) shall be as follows:



(a) It is understood and agreed that a party may be entitled to
indemnification, in accordance with the provisions hereof, whether based on a
claim directly between the parties or based on a claim brought by a third
party. The party claiming indemnification (the "Claimant") shall promptly give
notice to the party from which indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying
Party") and, in the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party against the
Indemnity Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent, of any claim, whether between the
parties or brought by a third party, specifying in reasonable detail the
factual basis for the claim and the amount thereof, if reasonably practicable
and estimated in good faith, and containing a reference to the provision(s) of
this Agreement under which such indemnification claim is made. If the claim
relates to an Action by a third party against Claimant (a "Third Party
Action"), such notice shall be given by Claimant within a reasonable period of
time after Claimant receives notice of such Third Party Action, which in any
event shall be no later than 20 Business Days after Claimant receives written
notice of such Third Party Action. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.



(b) With respect to claims solely between the parties, following receipt of
notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have up to
20 days to make such investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party
deems necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the
Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party and its authorized
representatives such documents and other information relating to the claim as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If the Claimant and the
Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such 20-day period
(or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the
full amount agreed to, subject to the terms hereof (including Sections 10.2(b)
and 10.3(b)), including where Seller is the Indemnifying Party and the claim
is to be satisfied by Indemnity Escrow Funds, by executing and delivering written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay the full amount so agreed from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do not
agree within such 20-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate remedies at law or equity, as
applicable, to enforce its claim for indemnification hereunder, subject to the
applicable limitations of Sections 10.2(b) and 10.3(b).



(c) The Claimant will be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the
Indemnifying Party and subject to the other terms and conditions herein, to
exercise full control of the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third
Party Action, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the giving of
notice of the Third Party Action by the Claimant to the Indemnifying Party
(but in no event later than 15 days thereafter), notifies the Claimant in
writing of the Indemnifying Party's intention to assume such defense,
acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Claimant for Losses related to
such Third Party Action, and promptly thereafter, retains legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant to conduct the defense of such Third
Party Action, (ii) the Third Party Action involves only money damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Claimant, (iii)
the Third Party Action does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection
with any criminal or regulatory enforcement action, and (iv) the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Action diligently. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party does not, within fifteen (15) days of its receipt
of notice of a Third Party Action pursuant to subclause (i) above of this
Section 10.4(c), elect to undertake such defense, Claimant may undertake the
defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Action with
counsel selected by it at the Indemnifying Party's cost. If the Claimant
defends any Third Party Action pursuant to the preceding sentence or pursuant
to subclauses (ii) - (iv) above of this Section 10.4(c), then the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly reimburse the Claimant for the reasonable costs and
expenses of defending such Third Party Action upon submission of periodic
bills.



(d) Each party will cooperate with the other party in connection with the
defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Action in accordance with
this Agreement in any manner that reasonably may be requested. If the
Indemnifying Party so assumes and prosecutes the defense of any such Third
Party Action in accordance with Section 10.4(c), the Claimant will have the
right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the
defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Action, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Claimant, unless (i)
the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the
Claimant has been advised by its legal counsel that there may be one or more
defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party or that an actual or potential conflict of
interest would make the representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Claimant by the same counsel inadvisable, and in any such case the reasonable
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party.



(e) No Claimant will settle or compromise any such Third Party Action for
which it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
10.4(e), an Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Claimant, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. An Indemnifying Party may
settle or compromise any Third Party Action without such consent so long as
the Indemnifying Party (i) receives a firm offer to settle such Third Party
Action without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of any Claimant,

(ii) pays the entire amount of such settled or compromised Third Party Action,
(iii) such settlement or compromise does not contain an admission of
wrongdoing on the part of any Claimant or contain any non-monetary terms, (iv)
such settlement or compromise provides for the full and unconditional release
of the Claimant in customary form from all liability in connection with such
Third Party Action and (v) the Indemnifying Party gives prior written notice
to the Claimant of such proposed settlement or compromise and the Claimant
fails to consent to such proposed settlement or compromise within 10 days
after its receipt of such notice.





10.5 No Circular Recovery. Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
hereby agrees that it will not make any claim for indemnification against any
Buyer Indemnified Party by reason of the fact that Seller or any of its
Affiliates was a controlling person, director, manager, employee or
representative of any of the Acquired Companies or was serving as such for
another Person at the request of any of the Acquired Companies (whether such
claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise) with respect to any claim
brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party against Seller under this Agreement or
otherwise relating to this Agreement. With respect to any claim brought by a
Buyer Indemnified Party against Seller under this Agreement or otherwise
relating to this Agreement, Seller expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against
the Acquired Companies with respect to any amounts owed by Seller pursuant to
this ARTICLE 10 or otherwise.





ARTICLE 11



TAX MATTERS



11.1 Tax Indemnity.



(a) Subject to Sections 10.2(b)(i) and 10.4, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify
Buyer and each Acquired Company and hold them harmless from and against (i)
all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes which, for the avoidance of doubt, are
addressed in Section 11.1(a)(iii) and Section 11.6) of Seller with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise, (ii) any Losses
attributable to all Taxes of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and (iii) Seller's allocable portion of all Transfer Taxes
pursuant to Section 11.6 (collectively, "Seller Taxes"); provided, however,
that Seller Taxes shall not include any Taxes solely to the extent directly
resulting from a breach by Buyer of Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(c), and 11.6.



(b) Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against any Losses attributable to all Taxes of the Acquired
Companies arising with respect to a Tax period, or portion thereof, beginning
after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period").



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
of this Section 11.1 shall continue in effect until 180 days following the
expiration of the applicable Tax-related statute of limitations (including any
extension thereof, whether automatic or permissive), at which time such
obligations shall expire and be of no further force or effect.



11.2 Straddle Period Allocation. For purposes of Section 11.1, the amount of
Taxes allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be: (a) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real
or personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations), the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of
Taxes not described in clause (a) above (such as payroll Taxes, Taxes imposed
upon or measured by income, Taxes based upon occupancy or imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of
any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough" entity, as if
the taxable period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity ended as
of the end of the Closing Date).



11.3 Tax Returns.



(a) Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates acknowledge and agree that
the sale and purchase of the Equity Interests shall be treated for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, and any analogous state or local Tax purposes, as
the sale and purchase of the assets of the Acquired Companies. Buyer, Seller
and their respective Affiliates will file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with such treatment, and will take no position inconsistent with
such characterization for federal, state or local income Tax purposes,
including in any audit, judicial or administrative proceeding, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.



(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.6, Seller shall prepare and
file (or cause to be prepared and filed) (i) all Flow-Through Tax Returns, and
(ii) all Tax Returns (other than Flow-Through Tax Returns) for the Acquired
Companies, for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (each Tax
Return described in clause (ii), a "Pre-Closing Tax Return"). Each such Pre-
Closing Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past custom
and practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.



(c) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed), all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies with respect to a Straddle Period (each, a
"Straddle Tax Return"), and each such Straddle Tax Return shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past custom and practice except as otherwise required
by applicable Law. Buyer shall provide a copy of each such Straddle Tax
Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to Seller for Seller's review and comment at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date (taking into account all valid extensions) for
filing such Straddle Tax Return, and Buyer shall include any reasonable
comments provided in writing by Seller to Buyer at least fourteen (14) days
prior to the due date (taking into account all valid extensions) for filing
such Straddle Tax Return.





11.4 Refunds. The amount or economic benefit of any Tax refund (whether in
cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) in respect of any Tax of the
Acquired Companies attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by
Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
for the account of Seller, to the extent such refund exceeds the amount of the
refund of such Taxes reflected as an asset on the books of the Acquired
Companies, and the recipient thereof shall pay such amount (including any
interest received thereon, but less any Taxes, reasonable costs or expenses
incurred by Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with obtaining such Tax refund) over to Seller within
ten (10) days after any such refund is received, credited or applied as an
offset, as the case may be. Buyer shall elect not to carry any loss, credit or
other Tax benefit item from a Post-Closing Tax Period (a "Post-Closing Tax
Refund") back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except in any case where it is
required by Law to carry back such Post-Closing Tax Refund, in which case any
refund due that is attributable to such Post-Closing Tax Refund will be
payable to Buyer. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event that any such Tax refund is subsequently determined by any
Governmental Entity to be less than the amount paid by the recipient thereof
to Seller pursuant to this Section 11.4, Seller shall return any such
disallowed amounts (plus any interest and penalties in respect of such
disallowed Tax refunds owed to a Governmental Entity) to such payor within ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of written notice from such payor requesting
the same.



11.5 Cooperation. Each of Buyer and Seller, and each of their respective
Affiliates, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of or with
respect to the Acquired Companies and/or during the course of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of or attributable to the
Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other party's request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Each of Seller and Buyer agrees, and following the Closing, Buyer agrees to
cause the Acquired Companies, (i) to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertaining to the Acquired Companies until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, and (ii) to give the other party (and
following the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to give
Seller) reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, on receipt of such notice, if the
other party so requests, Seller or Buyer shall, as applicable, allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller agree
that Seller shall be entitled to retain copies of the books and records of the
Acquired Companies which they believe are appropriate for the filing of Tax
Returns as described in this Article 11. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). Any
information or documents provided or retained under this Section 11.5 shall be
kept confidential by the party receiving or retaining the information or
documents, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns or in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceedings relating to Taxes.



11.6 Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for the
payment of fifty percent (50%) of all governmental Taxes, fees and charges
applicable to the transfer of the Equity Interests under this Agreement
(including sales, use and real property transfer taxes, stamp and stock
transfer taxes and the costs of recording or filing all applicable conveyance
instruments) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") and for the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in preparing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes. The parties hereto will cooperate, to the
extent reasonably requested and as permitted by applicable Law, in minimizing
any such Transfer Taxes. The party required by applicable Law to file a Tax
Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes will (a) do so within the time
period prescribed by applicable Law, pay the full amount of such Transfer Tax
to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law, (b)
notify the other party in writing of the amount paid, and (c) attach to such
notification a copy of any Tax Returns filed in connection with such Transfer
Tax. The other party shall pay the party that paid the Transfer Tax an amount
equal to fifty percent (50%) of such Transfer Tax by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after receiving such
notice.



11.7 Purchase Price Allocations. Within ninety (90) days following the
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.3(i), Buyer
shall deliver to Seller a draft allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, as determined
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of the Acquired
Companies in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Draft Allocation"). If Seller does
not object to the Draft Allocation within thirty (30) days of receipt thereof,
then the Draft Allocation shall become final and binding on the parties.
Seller shall make any objection to the Draft Allocation in writing to Buyer
and shall set forth the basis for such objection. If Seller timely objects to
the Draft Allocation, then Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in good faith
to resolve any disputes over the Draft Allocation and to attempt to resolve
any differences between the parties. Seller and Buyer and their Affiliates
shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form
8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the allocation as
agreed to (the "Final Allocation") and shall not take any position (whether in
audits or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation; provided,
however, that if Buyer and Seller fail to agree on a Final Allocation, the
disputed items shall be referred to the Independent Accountant for resolution
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(f) and the fees and
expenses of such Independent Accountant shall be borne by the parties in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(f). Any payments to be made
pursuant to Section 2.3(i) and any amounts paid by an Indemnifying Party under
Article 10 and Section 11.1 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price (including by Buyer and Seller on their respective Tax Returns) for Tax
purposes and allocated as provided by Treasury Regulation § 1.1060-1(c). The
parties will cooperate in good faith to promptly update the Final Allocation
for any adjustments to the Purchase Price and will prepare and file amended
Tax Returns to reflect such updated allocation, and not take any position
(whether in audits or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such updated
allocation.



11.8 Tax Claims.



(a) Upon receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any written notice from
a Taxing Authority of an audit, claim or proceeding with respect to Taxes for
which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification
under Section 10.2 or Section 11.1 or that could otherwise increase Seller's
liability for Taxes (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing. Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the relevant Taxing Authority and describe in
reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Claim.



(b) Seller shall have the right to control in good faith any Tax Claim that
relates solely to one or more taxable periods that end on or prior to the
Closing Date or to a Flow-Through Tax Return (including the right to settle or
compromise such Tax Claim); provided, however that, other than with respect to
any Tax Claim that relates to a Flow-Through Tax Return: (i) Seller will keep
Buyer informed concerning the progress, developments and events of the portion
of such Tax Claim; (ii) Seller will provide to Buyer copies of all
correspondence and other documents relevant to the portion of such Tax Claim;
and (iii) Seller will not settle the portion of such Tax Claim, if any,
related to the Acquired Companies, the Business, or the assets of the Acquired
Companies, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer will have the right
to participate in the defense of any such Tax Claim (other than a claim
relating to a Flow-Through Tax Return) (which will include participation in
meetings with Taxing Authorities and review and comment on written submissions
to Taxing Authorities) and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
from the counsel employed by Seller.



(c) With respect to any Tax Claim that Seller does not have the right to
control pursuant to Section 11.8(b) , Buyer will control in good faith such
Tax Claim (including the right to settle or compromise such Tax Claim);
provided, however, that Buyer (x) will keep Seller reasonably informed
concerning the progress, developments and events of such Tax Claim, (y)
provide Seller copies of all correspondence and other documents relevant to
such Tax Claim, and (z) will not settle such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In addition, Seller will have the right to participate
in the defense of any such Tax Claim (which will include participation in
meetings with Taxing Authorities and review and comment on written submissions
to Taxing Authorities) and to employ counsel, at Seller's expense, separate
from the counsel employed by Buyer.



(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that a
provision of this Section 11.8 directly conflicts with Section 10.4, this
Section 11.8 shall control.



11.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Each of Buyer and Seller agree that
any indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as
Purchase Price adjustments for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and state,
local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.





11.10 Wage Reporting. To the extent applicable, Seller and the Buyer shall
follow the "standard procedures" for preparing and filing Internal Revenue
Service Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as described in Revenue Procedure
2004-53 for Continuing Employees. Under this procedure, (i) Seller shall
provide all required Forms W-2 to (x) all Continuing Employees reflecting
wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller or any Acquired Company prior to the
Employment Commencement Date, and (y) all other employees and former employees
of Seller or any Acquired Company who are not Continuing Employees reflecting
all wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller or any Acquired Company, and (ii)
Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall provide all required Forms W-2 to all
Continuing Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by Buyer (or
one of its Affiliates) on and after the Employment Commencement Date.



11.11 Tax Sharing, Indemnity and Allocation Agreements. Any and all existing
Tax sharing, indemnity, allocation or similar agreements between Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (excluding the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and
any of the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated and all
payables and receivables arising thereunder shall be settled, in each case, at
or prior to Closing. After Closing, the Acquired Companies shall not have any

arising thereunder.





ARTICLE 12



Termination And Remedies

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as
follows:



(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;



(b) by written notice from Buyer to Seller if (i) Buyer is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) Seller breaches its
representations or warranties, or defaults in the performance of its
covenants, contained in this Agreement and (iii) all such breaches and
defaults of Seller that are not cured within the Cure Period would prevent any
of the conditions to the obligations of Buyer set forth in Section 8.1 from
being satisfied;



(c) by written notice from Seller to Buyer if (i) Seller is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) Buyer breaches its
representations or warranties, or defaults in the performance of its
covenants, contained in this Agreement and (iii) all such breaches and
defaults of Buyer that are not cured within the Cure Period would prevent any
of the conditions to the obligations of Seller set forth in Section 7.1 from
being satisfied; provided, however, that no Cure Period shall apply to Buyer's
obligation to pay the Purchase Price at the Closing; or



(d) by written notice from Buyer to Seller, or from Seller to Buyer, if (i)
the Closing does not occur by the nine (9) month anniversary of the date
hereof (such date, the "Outside Date"), unless the Closing has not occurred by
such date as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party
providing such notice of termination, (ii) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
otherwise prohibited or (iii) any Governmental Entity shall have issued a
Governmental Order restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-
appealable.



12.2 Cure Period. Prior to the Closing, each party shall give the other party
prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other
party under this Agreement, and such notice shall specify the breach. The term
"Cure Period" as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer or
Seller receives from the other written notice of breach or default hereunder
and continuing until the earlier of (i) twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of such notice or (ii) five (5) Business Days after the day otherwise
scheduled for the Closing.



12.3 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 12.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate
without liability on the part of any party hereunder; provided, however that
the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party of any
liability for breach or fraud under this Agreement that occurred prior to the
date of termination, and provided further that notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, ARTICLE 1 (Definitions; Interpretation),
Section 6.1 (Confidentiality), this Section 12.3, and ARTICLE 13
(Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

12.4 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by
any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone
and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party
hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages), such
party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree
of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief, subject to obtaining any required Governmental Consents, to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement
without posting any bond or other undertaking. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the party seeking specific
performance shall be entitled to enforce specifically (a) a party's
obligations under Section 2.5 and (b) a party's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to
consummate the Closing and pay the Purchase Price), if the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE 7 or ARTICLE 8, as applicable, have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing)
or waived, without the requirement of the prevailing party to post a bond. In
addition to the foregoing, the prevailing party enforcing its rights under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document shall be entitled to prompt payment
on demand from the other party of the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred by the prevailing party in enforcing such rights.



ARTICLE 13



MISCELLANEOUS



13.1 Expenses. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, each party shall
be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the
terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, all expenses incurred by
the Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the
negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents shall be paid by Seller. All
governmental fees and charges applicable to any requests for Governmental
Consents shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. Each party is
responsible for any commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar
payment that arises as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party
acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



13.2 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each party shall from time to
time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other,
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and
take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary in order to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



13.3 Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, provided, however, that Buyer may
assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer upon written notice to
Seller and Buyer may designate Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC, a Nevada
limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("SBH LLC"), as
the acquirer of the FCC Licenses under the FCC Applications or otherwise
effect an assignment of the FCC Licenses to Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC
effective as of the Closing or thereafter (and Seller agrees to cooperate with
Buyer in pursuing the FCC's consent to this assignment of the FCC Licenses to
SBH LLC so that such assignment may be completed at the Closing), provided
that (i) any such assignment or designation does not delay the processing of
the FCC Applications, the grant of the FCC Consent, the HSR Clearance or the
Closing, (ii) any such assignee of Buyer's rights under this Agreement shall
deliver to Seller a written instrument of assumption with respect to this
Agreement pursuant to which such assignee shall (x) make to Seller the
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE 4 with respect to such
assignee and (y) covenant to Seller to observe, satisfy, discharge and perform
the covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement and (iii) Buyer shall
remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder (including those assigned
to such assignee), including the payment of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer
shall be permitted to collaterally assign its rights and remedies under this
Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents to any Debt Financing Source in
respect of the Debt Financing, but no such assignment shall relieve any such
assignor of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the parties' respective successors and any permitted assigns, and no
assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or liability under this
Agreement.





13.4 Notices. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) when delivered by
hand, by registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or (b) upon
confirmation of receipt (other than an automatically-generated confirmation)
when sent by electronic mail to the address or email address, as applicable,
set forth beneath the name of such party below (or to such other address or
email address, as applicable, as such party shall have specified in a written
notice in accordance with this Section 13.4 given to the other parties
hereto):

13.5 Amendments; Waivers. No amendment or waiver of compliance with any
provision hereof or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective
unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in the case of a waiver or consent, by the
party against whom the waiver or consent is to be effective. No waiver by any
party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not,
will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation of,
default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No delay or omission on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a
waiver thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Debt Financing Provisions may be
amended, modified or waived in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources
without the prior consent of the Debt Financing Sources.



13.6 Severability. If any Governmental Entity holds any provision in this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any party or to any
circumstance under any applicable Law, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or part of a provision
of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be reformed and construed as if
such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision or part of a provision had
never been contained herein and such provision or part shall be reformed so
that it would be valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law; provided that any such reform or construction does not
affect the economic or legal substance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in a manner adverse to either party and, if any such
reform or construction does affect the economic or legal substance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner adverse to
either party, the parties shall negotiate in good faith a replacement
provision for such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision which shall
accomplish the original intention of the parties with respect to such
provision to the greatest extent practicable.



13.7 No Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.11, ARTICLE 10 and
ARTICLE 11, nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is intended or
shall be construed to give any rights to any Person other than the parties
hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be third-party beneficiaries of
each of the Debt Financing Provisions.



13.8 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a) This Agreement and the negotiation, execution, performance or
nonperformance, interpretation, termination, construction and all matters
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether arising at
law or in equity (collectively, the "Covered Matters"), and all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to the Covered Matters, except for documents, agreements and
instruments that specify otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof.



(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or
federal courts of the United States of America for the District of Delaware,
to the extent the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware does not have
jurisdiction over any such Action, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of
appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such Action. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. The
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 13.8 shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware, shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 13.8 and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any third party.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 13.8(a) or Section 13.8(b), each of
the parties agrees that it will not bring or support any Action of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance of the
transactions related thereto, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York located in the County of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), and makes the agreements, waivers and consents set
forth in Section 13.8(b) mutatis mutandis but with respect to the courts
specified in this Section 13.8(c).



(d) BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, INCLUDING ANY ACTION AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES
ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
DEBT FINANCING.





13.9 Neutral Construction. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement was
negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product of
the parties' negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly
and equally drafted by all such parties, and the provisions hereof should not
be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more
responsible for drafting the provision.



13.10 Non-Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources; Waiver of Certain Claims.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties hereto hereby agree that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates or any other Person relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or the Debt
Financing (including any claim for any Losses suffered as a result of any
breach of this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or the terms of the
Debt Financing), or any document related thereto (including any willful breach
thereof), or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to
be consummated), whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or
otherwise, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights
or claims whatsoever against any of the Debt Financing Sources under this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or in connection with the Debt
Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort, or otherwise.
Seller hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that none of the
Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligations to Seller or
any of its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein (including
with respect to the Debt Financing). Seller and its Affiliates hereby waive
any and all claims and causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Debt Financing Sources that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Documents, any financing commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including the Debt Financing). This Section 13.10 is intended to
benefit and may be enforced by the Debt Financing Sources and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Seller.





13.11 Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile/Email. This Agreement may be
executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original
and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. This
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, and each other agreement or instrument
entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or
thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by facsimile transmission or electronic mail in pdf form, shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or any party to any such agreement or instrument, each other
party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver
them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense.



13.12 Entire Agreement. The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits,
and the Ancillary Documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings with respect to the subject
matter hereof, except the NDA, which, subject to Section 6.1, shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. No party makes any
representation or warranty with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (or in any of
the Ancillary Documents, or any other agreement executed on the date hereof or
thereof in connection herewith or therewith).
