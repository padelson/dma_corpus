hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ".

  

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall

VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time) (but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day following

Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed in
accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), and shall make all other
filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate
of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Secretary of State_ ") or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such
later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such
Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions,
including Section 259, of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the

liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in a

Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance therewith and
applicable Law (subject to _Section 5.06_ hereof). At the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated in a form to be determined by Parent (subject to

2  

  

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) The parties hereto shall cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately

ARTICLE II 
  
  _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES;_ 
  _EQUITY-BASED AWARDS_

  

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than
Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall
instead be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled for no
consideration.

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than (i) Common Appraisal Shares to be treated in
accordance with _Section 2.07_ and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_) shall be automatically
converted into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $32.50 per share, without interest (subject to the
adjustments set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_ below, the " _Merger_

  

  

 

3  

  

 _Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated shares of Company
Common Stock held in book entry form (each, a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.03(b)_,
without interest. Any Merger Consideration paid in full upon the surrender of
any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book Entry Share
and the respective share of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

SECTION 2.02. _Minimum Cash_.

  

(a) Not more than five (5) and not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent appropriate bank
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other evidence in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, each dated as of the date of
delivery (accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company certifying as to the accuracy of such information), showing the
aggregate Cash held by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the last
calendar day of the most recently completed quarter of the calendar year (the
" _Actual Cash Amount_ "). During the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time (or until such earlier date on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_), the Company shall provide Parent
written notice of the Actual Cash Amount within ten (10) calendar days of the
end of each calendar year quarter.

  

(b) If the Minimum Cash Amount exceeds the Actual Cash Amount by an amount
more than $100,000, then the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced
dollar-for-dollar by the entire amount of such excess (and not merely the
amount over $100,000) and corresponding adjustments shall be made to the per
share Merger Consideration and the definition of "Merger Consideration" shall
be revised to take into account such adjustments made in accordance with this
_Section 2.02(b)_.

  

SECTION 2.03. _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a paying
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Article II_ and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall
enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided,
however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct, short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the

  

 

4  

  

funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated
by this _Section 2.03(a)_.

  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section
2.01(b)_) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other
customary provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to Book Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.01(c)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book Entry Share for
cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with such letter's
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent or Parent), the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book Entry Share surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.03_, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_.

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of, the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book
Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to the shares represented by such Certificates
or Book Entry Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. Subject to the

  

 

5  

  

last sentence of _Section 2.03(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates and Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares which immediately before the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock.

  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Paying
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto and the proceeds of any
investment thereof) which has not been disbursed to former holders of shares
of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ , and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (and only as a
general creditor thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration) for payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, without any interest thereon
and subject to any withholding Taxes required by applicable Law, upon due
surrender of their Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as applicable,
representing shares of Company Common Stock. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_ such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Upon becoming aware of any such withholding obligation,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
shall provide commercially reasonable notice to the Person with respect to
which such withholding obligation applies, and shall reasonably cooperate with
such Person to obtain any available reduction of or relief from such deduction
or withholding. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated

  

 

6  

  

for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

SECTION 2.04. _Equity-Based Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions (including, without limitation, obtaining holder consents)
that do not involve the payment of any consideration as may be required to
provide that:

  

(a) each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and
the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such Company Stock
Option, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option has not
been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, less applicable
income and employment tax withholdings (the " _Option Cashout Amount_ ");
_provided_ , that any such Company Stock Option with an exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration; and

  

(b) each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, as
of the Effective Time, be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become
entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect to such Company RSU, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration,
less applicable income and employment tax withholdings (the " _RSU Cashout
Amount_ ").

  

SECTION 2.05. _Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards_. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first payroll date
that occurs more than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll systems the Option Cashout
Amounts and the RSU Cashout Amounts pursuant to _Section 2.04_ and as set
forth on _Section 2.05_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any such amounts that constitute non-qualified
deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the
terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a
tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  

SECTION 2.06. _Adjustments_. If between the date hereof and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to

  

 

7  

  

reflect such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change.

  

SECTION 2.07. _Appraisal Rights_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Common Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.01(c)_, but instead shall be canceled and shall represent the right
to receive only those rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Person shall fail to perfect or
otherwise lose or validly withdraw the right to appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL, then the right of such Person to receive those rights under Section
262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Common Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only
the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.01(c)_, without interest thereon.

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice (and in any event within three
Business Days) to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock and Parent shall have the right to
direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands except as required by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
compromise, settle or compromise any such demands, approve any withdrawal of
any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent
of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

SECTION 3.03. _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_.

  

 

11  

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder
and, assuming the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.12_
are true and correct and subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by it of
the Transactions, have been duly authorized by its Board of Directors and,
except for obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and filing the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State pursuant to the DGCL, no
other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the Transactions and
declaring this Agreement and the Transactions advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) directing that the Company
submit this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon and (iii) recommending that the holders of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon adopt and approve this Agreement (such
recommendation, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), which resolutions
have not, except after the date hereof as permitted by _Section 5.02_, been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn.

  

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company
Stockholder Approva_ l") is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Transactions. The Written Consent, if executed and delivered,
would qualify as the Company Stockholder Approval and no additional approval
or vote from any holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company would then be necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Transactions.

  

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, nor performance or
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, conflict with or
violate any provision (A) of the Company Charter Documents or (B) of the
similar organizational documents of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, (ii)
assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in
_Section 3.04_ and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained prior to the
Effective Time and the filings referred to in _Section 3.04_ are made and any
waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired prior to the Effective
Time, violate any Law or Judgment applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any material respect, (iii) materially violate or constitute a
material breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise

  

 

12  

  

to a right of termination, modification, or cancelation of any material
obligation or to the loss of any material benefit under any of the terms or
provisions of any loan or credit agreement, indenture, debenture, note, bond,
mortgage, deed of trust, lease, sublease, license, contract or other agreement
(each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or accelerate the Company's or, if applicable, any of its Subsidiaries'
obligations under any such Contract or (iv) result in the creation of any Lien
(other than Permitted Lien) on any properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, (b) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State pursuant to
the DGCL and of appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to

Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, other than such other
consents, approvals, filings, licenses, permits or authorizations,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective effective dates (in
the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective
SEC filing dates or, if amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, applicable
to such Company SEC Documents, each as in effect on such respective dates, and
none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended
or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the date of the filing of such
amendment or supplement, with respect to the disclosures that are amended or
supplemented) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no material outstanding or unresolved

Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown

change in the Company's accounting methods or principles that would be
required to be disclosed in the Company's financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, except as described in the notes thereto.

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required under GAAP, as in effect on the date hereof, to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto) except liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against in the
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company as of June
30, 2018 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") included in the Filed SEC Documents,
(ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business,

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. As of the

been incurred by the Company or any Commonly Controlled Entity that has not
been satisfied in full and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a risk to the Company of incurring such liability.

  

(d) No Company Plan is or was within the past six (6) years, and neither the
Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity sponsors, maintains or contributes

Agreement or (ii) received any notification that any such plan is in
reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), has been

(e) No Company Plan provides, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
obligated to provide, benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or

employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Company Plan, (ii) cause the Company to transfer or set aside any
assets to fund any benefits under any Company Plan, (iii) cause any
"disqualified individual" to receive any "excess parachute payment" (each such
term as defined in Section 280G of the Code) or (iv) limit or restrict the
right to amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any Company Plan on or

entire period during which Section 409A of the Code has applied to such
Company Plan), and no additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code
has been incurred by a participant in any such Company Plan. No Company Stock
Option has an exercise price that has been or may be less than the fair market
value of the underlying equity securities of the Company as of the date such
Company Stock Option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later

ARTICLE IV 
  
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

  

Parent and Merger Sub each represent and warrant to the Company:

  

SECTION 4.01. _Organization; Standing_. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite power and authority necessary to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 4.02. _Authority; Noncontravention_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
corporate authority to execute and deliver, in the case of Parent, this
Agreement to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, as applicable,
and to consummate the Transactions. The Board of Directors of Parent has
adopted resolutions approving the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, which
resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. The
Board of Directors of Merger Sub has adopted resolutions (i) unanimously
approving the Merger and the execution, delivery and performance by Merger Sub
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) declaring
that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable and in the best
interests of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and (iii) directing that this
Agreement be submitted to Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub entitled
to vote thereon, for adoption thereby, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. No vote of holders of capital
stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the

consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
Transactions. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this
Agreement and approve the Transactions by written consent duly executed and
delivered immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and will promptly deliver to the Company a true and complete copy of its
action by written consent adopting this Agreement and approving the
Transactions in accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub prior to the Closing. Except as
expressly set forth in this _Section 4.02(a)_, no other corporate action
(including any stockholder vote or other action) on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions. This Agreement has been (or will be, as the
case may be) duly executed and delivered by Parent and by Merger Sub and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company,
constitutes (or will constitute, as the case may be) a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and by Merger Sub,
the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions and the
performance or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will not (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable charter or
organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) assuming that the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.03_ are
obtained prior to the Effective Time and the filings referred to in _Section
4.03_ are made and any waiting periods with respect to such filings have
terminated or expired prior to the Effective Time, (x) violate any Law or
Judgment applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (y) violate or constitute a breach or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, modification, or cancelation of any obligation or to the loss of
any benefit under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract
to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party
or accelerate Parent's, Merger Sub's or any of their respective Subsidiaries',
if applicable, obligations under any such Contract, except, in the case of
clause (ii), as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 4.03. _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State pursuant to the DGCL and the
filing of appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to

Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions,
other than such other consents, approvals, filings,

  

 

35  

  

licenses, permits or authorizations, declarations or registrations that, if
not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 4.04. _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns, and at
and immediately prior to the Effective Time will own, beneficially and of
record, all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub, free and clear of
all Liens except for such Liens and transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act. Merger Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement, Merger Sub does not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to the Transactions, and prior to the Effective Time,
will not have engaged in any other business activities other than those
relating to the Transactions.

  

SECTION 4.05. _Sufficiency of Funds_.

  

(a) Parent has, or at the Closing will have together with the proceeds of the
Guarantee, sufficient cash to enable Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all
related fees and expenses required to be paid on such date. Parent has the
financial resources and capabilities, together with the proceeds of the
Guarantee, to fully perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

(b) Without limiting _Section 8.08_, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

  

SECTION 4.06. _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 6.01_

consideration to which the stockholders and other holders of equity securities
and rights and options to purchase equity securities of the Company are
entitled under _Article II_, funding of any obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries which become due or payable by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the
Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will not: (i) be
insolvent (either because their financial condition is such that the sum of
their debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the
fair market value of their assets or because the fair saleable value of their
assets is less than the amount required to pay their probable liability on
their existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the
businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have
incurred debts, or be expected to incur debts, including contingent and other
liabilities, beyond their ability to pay them as they become due.

  

 

36  

  

SECTION 4.07. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement

assets of the Company which it and its Representatives have desired or
requested to review, and that it and its Representatives have had full
opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the
business and assets of the Company. Except for the representations and

contemplation of any of the Transactions. Parent, on behalf of itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates, expressly waives any such claim relating to the
foregoing matters. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that it has conducted, to
its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the business,
operations, assets and financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, in making its determination to proceed with the Transactions, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives have
relied on the results of such investigation and the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_.

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading.

which has not previously been provided to Parent and Merger Sub.

  

(c) The Company's Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in _Section 5.02(b)_ unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, personnel,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party.
In such notice, the Company shall identify the third party making any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and provide the details of the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a current and prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, including the material terms and conditions thereof any
material amendments or proposed amendments. The Company shall promptly provide
Parent copies of any nonpublic information concerning the Company's business,
present or future performance, financial condition or results of operations
provided to any third party to the extent such information has not been
previously provided to Parent.

  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.02(d)_, neither the Company's Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, change,
withdraw, withhold, amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to make,
change, withdraw, withhold, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal, (ii) make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation, (iii) resolve or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), or (iv) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, the
Company's Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or cause the Company to enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal only if
the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that (i) the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company's Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that prior to taking such action, (A) the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ")
before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or
causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall (1) state expressly that the Company has received an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company's Board of Directors intends to declare a Superior
Proposal and that the Company's Board of Directors intends to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a
Company Acquisition

  

 

44  

  

Agreement, and (2) include a copy of the most current version of the proposed
agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (which version shall be updated
on a prompt basis, but in each case redacted as necessary to exclude the
identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal), and a description
of any financing commitments relating thereto; (B) the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith in respect of adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it
being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period,
there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including,
any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (C)
following the end of such Notice Period (as extended pursuant to the preceding
clause (B)) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any
adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and provided, further, that the Company has
complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.02_.

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company, after
the receipt of advice from outside legal counsel that failure to disclose such
position would constitute a violation of applicable Law, from (i) disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any disclosures permitted
under this _Section 5.02(e)_ that does not contain either an express rejection
of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the
Company) in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the Company
Board Recommendation.

  

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any
additional

  

 

45  

  

instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iv) defend or
contest in good faith any Action brought by a third party that could otherwise
prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the
consummation of the Transactions, in the case of each of clauses (i) through
(iv), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in _Section
5.03(c)_ below. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, all
applicable foreign antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a
Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees: (i) to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) to make the appropriate filings under the Other Required
Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable following
the date of this Agreement, (iii) to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and such Other Required Antitrust Laws and
(iv) to promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment and obtain all consents under any such Antitrust Laws
that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local
Governmental Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to
enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall promptly take all actions necessary to secure the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or any such Other Required Antitrust Law and resolve any objections asserted
with respect to the Transactions under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any
other applicable Law raised by any Governmental Authority, in order to prevent
the entry of, any Restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay
the consummation of the Transactions, including (A) agreeing to sell, divest
or otherwise convey or hold separate any particular assets or categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with
or subsequent to the Effective Time, (B) permitting the Company to sell,
divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any of the particular assets or
categories of assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, (C) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (D)
terminating any joint venture or other arrangement of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (E) creating any relationship, contractual right or obligation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or, in each case, entering into agreements
or stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by, or filing appropriate
applications with, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust

  

 

46  

  

Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and, in the
case of actions by or with respect to the Company, by consenting to such
action by the Company (including any consents required under this Agreement
with respect to such action)). Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent entity" as that term is defined in
the HSR Act to cause) the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant
of "early termination," and make any further filings pursuant thereto that may
be necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith. Parent shall be
responsible for all fees and expenses of the Company and its Affiliates in
responding to any requests for additional information. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall, without the written consent of the Company (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), "pull-and-refile"
pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 any filing made under the HSR Act, or take any
similar action without prior written approval from the Company with respect to
any filing made with any Governmental Authority. The Company and Parent shall
respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any
objections asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to, or that
could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or termination
of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the
DOJ or FTC or under any Other Required Antitrust Laws. Nothing in this
Agreement (x) shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations in connection with obtaining the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any
approvals under, the HSR Act or Other Required Antitrust Laws or approvals
from any other Governmental Authorities, unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing or (y) shall require
Parent or its Affiliates to (and neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall without the express written consent of Parent) defend through litigation
any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person
(including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would prevent the Closing prior to
the Outside Date.

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto agrees to: (i) prepare and pre-file with CFIUS
a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA with respect to the Transactions,
and, following such pre-filing, file a formal notice of the Transactions with
CFIUS in accordance with the DPA (the " _CFIUS Filing_ "), (ii) supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the DPA (and in all cases within
the amount of time provided by CFIUS pursuant to the DPA) and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date) take any and all steps
necessary to obtain CFIUS Clearance. Following submission of the CFIUS Filing,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, each of the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate to respond in a timely, accurate and complete manner to
any questions received from CFIUS or its member agencies. No party hereto
shall communicate with any Governmental Authority in respect of the CFIUS
Filing without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of such
communication and, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
written communication and, with respect to any oral communications, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate in such oral communications.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, none of the parties
hereto shall have any obligation to share with the others any

  

 

47  

  

confidential business information unrelated to the Transactions, including to
the extent such information is requested by CFIUS. In furtherance of the
above, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with the development
and implementation of any mitigation plan or other related action which the
parties hereto agree to be necessary to obtain the CFIUS Clearance and to
avoid or prevent the imposition by CFIUS of a condition of any kind in respect
of the Transactions and the consummation thereof (including any requirement by
CFIUS that any party hereto enter into any additional agreement relating to
the Transactions).

  

(e) If the parties hereunder mutually agree to obtain AWG Clearance, each of
the parties hereto agrees to: (i) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by
BMWi pursuant to the AWG and/or AWV (and in all cases within the amount of
time provided by BMWi) and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event so as to enable the parties hereto to
consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date)
take any and all steps necessary to obtain AWG Clearance. Following submission
of the filing pursuant to AWG, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
each of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate to respond to any
questions received from BMWi or its subordinate agencies. No party hereto
shall communicate with any Governmental Authority in respect of the AWG filing
without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of such communication
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity
to review and comment on any proposed written communication and, with respect
to any oral communications, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in
such oral communications. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall have any obligation to share with
the others any confidential business information unrelated to the
Transactions, including to the extent such information is requested by BMWi.

  

(f) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private person, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority (including any "4(c) documents"
and "4(d) documents" as these terms are used in the rules and regulations
under the HSR Act) and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions and (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult
with the other parties hereto with respect to information relating to the
other parties hereto and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third Person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions; _provided_ , that any such information or materials referred to
in (i) \- (iii) may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and (y) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or communication with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to this

  

 

48  

  

 _Section 5.03_ without giving the other parties hereto reasonable prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting or
communication.

  

SECTION 5.04. _Publicity; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release of the parties hereto. Except in connection with (i) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (ii) a press release or other public statement that
is required by Law or the rules or regulation of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or Governmental Authority, in each
case, as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make
such release, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may, without any consultation with Parent, make
communications in support of this Agreement or the Merger and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will comply with the applicable terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements, each dated April 24, 2018, by
and between the Company, on the one hand, and each of KCC Corporation, Wonik
Holdings and SJL Partners, LLC, on the other hand (collectively, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause their
respective officers, employees, auditors and other representatives to hold and
treat, in confidence all confidential information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
Transactions in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect each in accordance with its terms.

  

SECTION 5.05. _Access to Information_.

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.01_, Parent shall be entitled (at Parent's sole cost and
expense), through its Representatives to have such access to the properties,
businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such
examination of the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it
reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with
Parent's efforts to consummate the Transactions. Any such access and
examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under
reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to restrictions under applicable
Law. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parent's
Representatives in connection with such access and examination, and Parent and
its Representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the business.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no such access or
examination shall be permitted to the extent that (x) it could unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) the
Company determines in good faith that such access or examination could
jeopardize the

  

 

49  

  

attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or material Contract of the
Company, (ii) nothing in this _Section 5.05_ shall require cooperation to the
extent that it would (A) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in
_Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_ to not be satisfied or (B) cause any breach
of this Agreement and (iii) the Company may elect to limit, or cause any of
its Subsidiaries to limit, disclosure of any information to certain Persons
designated, at the request of the Company, as a "clean team" of Parent (which
Persons must be acceptable to the Company).

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, between the
date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01_ , (x) without the
prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and
shall cause their Representatives and Affiliates not to contact any suppliers,
customers, independent contractors, landlords, lessors, banks, or any other
Person whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have or have had a business
relationship, other than with respect to matters not involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries, this Agreement or Transactions; _provided_ , that the
Company shall have the right to have one or more Representatives present
during any such contact in the event that it consents to such contact, and (y)
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any right to perform invasive or
subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company.
Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties that may be incurred by
any of them arising out of or related to the use, storage or handling by
Parent or its Representatives of (i) any personally identifiable information
relating to employees, providers or customers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any other information that is protected by applicable
Law (including privacy Laws) or Contract to which Parent or its
Representatives are afforded access pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
The Company does not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
any information provided (if any) pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ , and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the accuracy of any such
information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the Company's
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ ; _provided_ , that
no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ by Parent, Merger Sub or
their Representatives shall be deemed to modify any of the Company's
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_. No rights under
this _Section 5.05_ may be exercised by Parent or any of its Representatives
to prepare for, or otherwise in connection with, any Action relating to this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the Transactions.

  

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, in each case to the fullest extent permissible by applicable
Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time
is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company, or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary as a director,
partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee

  

 

50  

  

benefit plan or other enterprise (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary, (B) the fact
that an Indemnitee is or was a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee
or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary or (C) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as such or taken at the request or
direction of the Company or such Subsidiary or any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company, in each
case under clauses (A), (B) or (C), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective
Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or
relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnitee) and (ii) assume (in the case of the
Surviving Corporation, following the Merger without any further action) all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided
in the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or similar
organizational documents of any Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof.
Parent, from and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company to contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnitee thereunder with respect to limitation of
liabilities and rights to advancement and indemnification than are set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) of the Company and each Subsidiary,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall require the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify any Indemnitees to the extent such
indemnification would not be permitted to be provided by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company under applicable Law (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, Section 145 of the DGCL). Any Indemnitee wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.06(a)_ with respect to any Action shall
notify the Surviving Corporation of such Action promptly after becoming aware
thereof. In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, without requiring a preliminary determination of
entitlement to indemnification, advance any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.06_
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this _Section 5.06_ ) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that, the individual to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it
shall be determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Section 5.06(a)_ or applicable Law.

  

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 5.06_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which rights to indemnification or
advancement have been asserted by an Indemnitee

  

 

51  

  

hereunder or are otherwise available, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of
any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Indemnitees
who are currently (and any additional Indemnitees who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable in the aggregate to such individuals than those of
such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies, issued by insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating
by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance, of
at least the same aggregate coverage with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_
, that if the aggregate annual premium for such insurance exceeds 250% of the
annual premium for such insurance as of the date hereof (the " _Premium Cap_
"), then the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause to be provided a
policy covering such individuals with as much coverage as reasonably
practicable at a cost up to but not exceeding such Premium Cap. The Company
may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the Transactions, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the
aggregate maximum amount payable pursuant to the proviso above for such six
year period. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company,
it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to
this _Section 5.06(c)_ and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.06_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 5.06_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section
5.06_ applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.06_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.06_).

  

(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (x) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or

recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
the Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit retirement plan or (iii) for all
purposes under any equity compensation plans and arrangements maintained by

to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to

and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and

purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are solely for the benefit of the

compensation plan or program, (ii) obligates Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to retain the employment of any
particular employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the

and expense, in the defense of any Transaction Litigation involving the

consummated (even if after such twelve-month period); _provided_ , that, for
purposes of clauses (A) and (B) of this _Section 7.03(a)(i)_, the references
to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"; or

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.01(c)(ii)_ or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_;

  

then, in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section 7.03(a)_,
the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee by
wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of _Section 7.03(a)(ii)(A)_,

_Section 7.03(a)(ii)(B)_, simultaneously with such termination or (z) in the
case of _Section 7.03(a)(i)_, within two (2) Business Days after the
consummation of the Acquisition Proposal referred to therein; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal
to 4% of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the provisions for payment of the
Company Termination Fee are an integral part of the Transactions and are
included herein in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to pay any amounts due under this _Section
7.03_ and Parent commences a suit which results in a final, nonappealable
judgment against the Company, for any such amounts or any portion thereof,
then the Company shall pay Parent's costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on any such amounts at the prime rate (as published in The Wall
Street Journal) in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

  

(c) In the event the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent in
circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_,
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective former, current or future
equityholders, controlling Persons, limited or general partners, managers,
members, Affiliates, assignees or Representatives against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents
or any their respective assignees or successors or any former, current or
future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling Person, manager,
member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent,
assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Company
Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for any breach of, or failure to perform under,
this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith or otherwise or in respect of any representation or warranty (express
or implied) made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort
or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, in consideration of the payment
by the Company of the Company Termination Fee,

  

 

63  

  

Parent and Merger Sub unconditionally and irrevocably agree to (and will cause
their respective Affiliates and each of the foregoing's respective
Representatives to) not exercise, and waive, any and all claims and rights it
or they may have against the Company and its direct and indirect stockholders
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and the Company's Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives).

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  

SECTION 8.01. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any document or instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall survive the
Effective Time. This _Section 8.01_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or in any document or instrument delivered
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by its terms applies in
whole or in part after the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement_. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the parties
hereto; _provided, however_ , that following receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment to the provisions hereof
which by Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such approval. Any amendment or supplement to this Agreement shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 8.03. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (i)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (ii)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
other party or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained herein applicable to such party or, except as otherwise
provided herein, waive any of such party's conditions (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the
foregoing); _provided_ , _however_ , that following receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, there shall be no waiver or extension of this Agreement
that decreases the Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights
of the stockholders of the Company without such approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

 

64  

  

SECTION 8.04. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 8.04_ shall be null and void.

  

SECTION 8.05. _Counterparts_. This Agreement (i) may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including by e-mail in .pdf format), each of which shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement, (ii) shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto and (iii) to the extent signed and delivered by means
of a scanned pages via e-mail, shall be treated in all manner and respect as
an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

  

SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Letter, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except for, if the Effective Time occurs, the rights of the
Indemnitees set forth in _Section 5.06_ of this Agreement and the rights of
the Company Related Parties set forth in _Section 7.03(c)_, which are intended
for the benefit of the Persons and shall be enforceable by such Persons.

  

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

  

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over any Action, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of
an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section
8.07(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon
such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
_Section 8.10_ of this Agreement. The parties

  

 

65  

  

hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the
following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section 8.07(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement
and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either party has an
adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8.08_ shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party hereto brings
any action, in each case, in accordance with _Section 8.08_, to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
entitled to seek an award of specific performance or any other remedy (whether
at law, in equity or otherwise) other than payment of the Company Termination
Fee in any circumstance in which the Company Termination Fee is payable under
_Article VII_ hereof.

  

SECTION 8.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

  

 

66  

  

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.09_.

  

SECTION 8.10. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, sent by e-mail (with non-automated written confirmation of
receipt), or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the
parties at the following addresses or e-mail addresses:
