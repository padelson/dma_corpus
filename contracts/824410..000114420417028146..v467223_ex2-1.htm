Agreement and Plan of Merger

  



  

This is an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 15, 2017
("Agreement"), by and among Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("Parent"), Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a Virginia corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and WashingtonFirst Bankshares,
Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company").

  



  

Introductory Statement

  



  

The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company have determined that
this Agreement and the business combination and related transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and that it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which (i)
Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge
with and into the Company (the "First-Step Merger"), so that the Company is
the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) immediately thereafter, the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, will merge (the "Second-Step
Merger" and, together with the First-Step Merger, the "Integrated Mergers")
with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation.

  



  

The parties hereto intend that the Integrated Mergers shall together be
treated as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC") and that this Agreement is
intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the IRC and within the meaning of Treasury
regulation section 1.368-2(g).

  



  

Parent and the Company each desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the business combination and
related transactions provided for herein and to prescribe various conditions
to such transactions.

  



  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company have entered into an agreement pursuant
to which each such stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote
his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock in favor of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of Parent have entered into an agreement
pursuant to which each such stockholder has agreed, among other things, to
vote his or her shares of Parent Common Stock in favor of the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger.

  



  

In consideration of their mutual promises and obligations hereunder, the
parties hereto adopt and make this Agreement and prescribe the terms and
conditions hereof and the manner and basis of carrying it into effect, which
shall be as follows:

  



    

1

 



    



  

ARTICLE I

  

Mergers

  



  

1.1 The Mergers.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including the Plan of Merger substantially in the form attached as
_Exhibit A_ , in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the
"VSCA"), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company at the Effective
Time. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger
and shall continue its existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia. Upon consummation of the First-Step Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

  



  

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and the VSCA, the Company, as the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, shall merge with and into Parent.
Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to
in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Second-Step Merger,
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Maryland. Upon consummation of the Second-Step Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall terminate.

  



  

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Integrated Mergers (the "Closing") will take place in the
offices of Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP, 607 14th Street NW, Washington,
DC, or at such other location as is agreed to by the parties hereto, at a
time as agreed to by the parties hereto on the date designated by Parent
within seven (7) days following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), or such later date
as the parties may otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").

  



  

1.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Merger Sub and
the Company shall duly execute and deliver Articles of Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") to the Virginia State Corporation Commission for filing
in accordance with Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA. The First-Step Merger shall
become effective at such date and time as Parent and the Company agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the First-Step Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  



  

1.4 Effects of the First-Step Merger. The First-Step Merger will
have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, the Company shall possess all of the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and be subject to all of the
debts, liabilities and obligations of Merger Sub.

  



    

2

 



    



  

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First-Step Merger,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company
Voting Common Stock") and each share of the Non-Voting Common Stock, Series A
of the Company ("Company Non-Voting Common Stock," and, together with the
Company Voting Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, other than (i) Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide
fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously
contracted, by Parent, the Company or a Subsidiary of either
(collectively "Excluded Shares"), shall become and be converted into a number
of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") as follows:

  



  

(i) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $53.23, the Exchange
Ratio shall equal .8210;

  



  

(ii) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $50.15 and equal to
or less than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient of $43.70
divided by the Parent Average Price;

  



  

(iii) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $37.07
and equal to or less than $50.15, the Exchange Ratio shall equal .8713;

  



  

(iv) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $34.00
and less than $37.07, the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient of
$32.30 divided by the Parent Average Price; and

  



  

(v) if the Parent Average Price is less than $34.00, the Exchange
Ratio shall equal .9500.

  



  

"Parent Average Price" shall mean the volume-weighted average price per
share, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent, of Parent Common Stock on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the fifth business day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or any
successor thereto, through its "volume weighted average price" function (or,
if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Parent and the Company). The Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First-
Step Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor will be issued in the First-Step Merger; instead, Parent shall pay
to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the
nearest cent, determined by multiplying such fraction by the Parent Average
Price.

  



    

3

 



    



  

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

  



  

1.6 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Parent Common Stock. At and
after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding and shall not be affected by the First-Step Merger.

  



  

1.7 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Common Stock of Merger Sub. At
and after the Effective Time, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.8 Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , until such Articles of Incorporation
are thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

  



  

1.9 Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of the Company, as the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger,
shall be the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and
applicable law.

  



  

1.10 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted by the Company under a Company Stock Plan or assumed by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a "Company Stock Option") shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), no later than the
first payroll period following the Effective Time and in any event no later
than thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cash-out Price
over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company
Stock Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or
equal to the Equity Award Cash-out Price shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Equity Award Cash-out Price" means an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Price.

  



    

4

 



    



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Restricted Stock Award"
and, together with the Company Stock Options, the "Company Equity Awards")
shall fully vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_. Parent
shall pay or issue the consideration described in this _Section 1.10(b)_
within five (5) business days following the Effective Time. Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold under the IRC or any provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax
law.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company and/or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 1.10_., including delivering written notice to
each holder of a Company Equity Award of the treatment of such award pursuant
to this _Section 1.10_  and taking reasonable steps to obtain each such
holder's written acknowledgement and agreement of the treatment set forth in
this _Section 1.10_, in each case not less than 30 days prior to the Closing
and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at or prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Equity Awards.

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Stock Plans" means the
WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and the 1st
Portfolio Holding Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.

  



  

1.11 Bank Merger. Concurrently with or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sandy
Spring Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and WashingtonFirst Bank, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, shall enter into the Plan of Bank
Merger, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_, pursuant to which
WashingtonFirst Bank will merge with and into Sandy Spring Bank (the "Bank
Merger"). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become
effective simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time.

1.12 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent may
specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
be revised and the parties shall enter into such alternative transactions as
Parent may reasonably determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided, however,_ that such revised structure shall not (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede
or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iii) adversely limit or impact the qualification of the Integrated
Mergers as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
IRC. In the event that Parent elects to make such a revision, the parties
agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the revised structure.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  

Exchange Procedures

  



  

2.1 Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the holders of certificates, or evidence of shares in book entry form,
representing Company Common Stock ("Old Certificates"), for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates, or at Parent's option,
evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the Parent Common Stock
("New Certificates"), to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and this Article II in exchange for outstanding
shares of such Company Common Stock, and (b) to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.5(b)_ (such New Certificates and cash being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, or as
otherwise directed by Parent.

  



  

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ , a letter
of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration which such holder shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, _Section
1.5(a)_ , and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement
as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_. From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old
Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed Letter of Transmittal duly
executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing the Merger Consideration to which such holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance
with, and subject to, _Section 1.5(a)_ , and (ii) a check representing the
amount of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old
Certificates pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ and (2) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ , and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash
in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates or any
dividends payable under _Section 2.2(c)_. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.2_ , each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect
of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.

    

6

 



    



  

(b) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by
it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer
of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to
the transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing such Company
Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Exchange
Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  



  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Old
Certificates in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, upon the surrender of
such person's Old Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive any
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent
to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock represented by such person's Old Certificates.

  



  

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of
any shares of Company Common Stock other than to settle transfers of Company
Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange
Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_.

  



    

7

 



    



  

(e) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant
to _Section 1.5_ , any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant
to this _Section 2.2_ or any proceeds from any investments thereof that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the
written request of Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof)
shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(f) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
Company's stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Old Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

  



  

(g) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

  



  

2.3 Appraisal Rights.

  



  

(a) In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal
rights shall be available to the holders of Company Voting Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and
unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share of Company Non-Voting
Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which is owned by a holder who (i) shall not have voted or
caused or permitted any of his, her or its shares to be voted in favor of the
First-Step Merger, and (ii) pursuant to Section 13.1-729 _et seq._ of the
VSCA, duly and validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights
with respect to his, her or its shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock
(the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof, with respect to
such Dissenting Shares, shall be entitled to payment in cash from the
Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of the VSCA. If any such holder shall have
failed to duly and validly exercise or perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights, each share of Company
Non-Voting Common Stock of such holder as to which appraisal rights were not
duly and validly exercised or perfected, or were effectively withdrawn or
lost, shall not be deemed a Dissenting Share and shall automatically be
converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. The Company
will provide Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on and received
by the Company pursuant to Section 13.1-729 _et seq_. of the VSCA, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any demands for appraisal under the VSCA. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such
demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  



  

Except (i) as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2015
and prior to the date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) and (ii) as disclosed in disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") (which schedule sets forth, among other
things, facts, circumstances and events the disclosure of which is necessary
or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III, or to one or
more of the Company's covenants contained in Articles V or VI (and making
specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they relate); 
_provided_ , that (x) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the
related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (y) the
mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the
Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, circumstance
or event or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (z) disclosure in any paragraph of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except
to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure that
it is relevant to another paragraph of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
another Section of this Agreement), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia, is registered with the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") as a bank holding company
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), and
has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC
Act. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business currently being
conducted by it. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, "Material
Adverse Effect" shall mean an effect, circumstance, occurrence or change
which is material and adverse to the business, financial condition or results
of operations of the Company or Parent, as the context may dictate, and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such effect,
circumstance, occurrence or change resulting from any (i) changes in laws,
rules or regulations or GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements or
interpretations thereof that apply to financial and/or depository institutions
and/or their holding companies generally, (ii) changes in economic conditions
affecting financial institutions generally, including but not limited to,
changes in the general level of market interest rates, (iii) actions and
omissions of Parent or the Company taken with the prior written consent, or
at the request, of the other, (iv) direct effects of compliance with this
Agreement on the operating performance of the parties, including expenses
incurred by the parties in investigating, negotiating, documenting, effecting
and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) changes
in national or international political or social conditions including the
engagement by the United States in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the
declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military
or terrorist attack upon or within the United States, and (vi) any failure, in
and of itself, by Parent or the Company to meet any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions in respect of revenues,
earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for any period (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to
such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to become,
a Material Adverse Effect, to the extent permitted by this definition and
not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso) shall not be considered
in determining if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred except, with respect
to clauses (i), (ii) and (v), to the extent that the effects of such change
disproportionately affect such party and its Subsidiaries as compared to
comparable U.S. banking organizations. The Company engages only in activities
(and holds properties only of the types) permitted to bank holding companies
by the BHC Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

3.2 Subsidiaries.

  



  

(a) Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth with
respect to each of the Company's direct and indirect Subsidiaries its name,
its jurisdiction of incorporation, the Company's percentage ownership, the
number of shares of stock or other equity interests owned or controlled by
the Company and the name and number of shares held by any other person who
owns any stock of the Subsidiary. As used in this Agreement, the word
"Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank, trust or other organization,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is (i) consolidated with such
party for financial reporting purposes or (ii) directly or indirectly (through
one or more intermediaries) controlled by or owned more than fifty percent
(50%) by such party (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Company,
the statutory business trusts related to the trust preferred securities issued
or assumed by the Company are Subsidiaries of the Company). The Company owns
of record and beneficially all the capital stock or other equity interests of
each of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any charge, mortgage, pledge,
security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance ("Lien"). There are no
contracts, commitments, agreements or understandings relating to the Company's
right to vote or dispose of any equity securities of its Subsidiaries. The
Company's ownership interest in each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to equity investments by
bank holding companies or Virginia-chartered banks.

  



    

10

 



    



  

(b) Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation,
has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to conduct the business currently being conducted by it and is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(c) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have
been validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. No shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company
are or may be required to be issued by virtue of any options, warrants or
other rights, no securities exist that are convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of such capital stock or any other debt or equity security of any
Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, agreements or
understandings of any kind for the issuance of additional shares of capital
stock or other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary or options, warrants
or other rights with respect to such securities.

  



  

(d) WashingtonFirst Bank is a Virginia-chartered bank. No Subsidiary
of the Company other than WashingtonFirst Bank is an "insured
depository institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as
amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder. WashingtonFirst Bank's
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC")
through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  



  

3.3 Capital Structure.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
50,000,000 shares of Company Voting Common Stock, (ii) 10,000,000 shares of
non-voting common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 2,000,000 shares
have been designated Non-Voting Common Stock, Series A, and (iii) 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $5.00 per share, of which no shares of
preferred stock are issued or outstanding.

  



  

(b) As of May 10, 2017, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, other than:

  



  

(i) 12,238,573 shares of Company Voting Common Stock, all of which
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued in full
compliance with all applicable laws and not in violation of any preemptive
rights, which number includes 16,663 shares of Company Voting Common Stock
granted in respect of outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards;

  



  

(ii) 816,835 shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock, all of which
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued in

(ii) 570,303 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options.

  



  

(c) Since May 10, 2017, the Company has not (i) issued, repurchased,
redeemed or acquired any Company Common Stock, other shares of its
capital stock, or other voting securities or securities convertible or
exchangeable into, or exercisable for, Company Common Stock, or any options,
warrants, or other rights of any kind to acquire Company Common Stock, other
than the issuance, repurchase, redemption or acquisition of shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the exercise, vesting or settlement of Company
Equity Awards that were outstanding on May 10, 2017 in accordance with their
terms (without amendment or waiver since May 10, 2017) or (ii) issued or
awarded any options, restricted shares or any other equity-based awards under
any of the Company Stock Plans.

  



  

(d) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the
right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote
are issued or outstanding. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports, as
of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are issued or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not deferring
interest payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or related
junior subordinated debt securities issued or assumed by it or any of its
affiliates.

  



  

(e) There are no contractual obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which the Company or its Subsidiaries could be
required to register shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries under the Securities Act other than the
Registration Rights Agreement dated as of December 30, 2014 by and among the
Company and certain stockholders thereof, which shall be terminated and be of
no further force or effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to an amendment
in full force and effect as of the date hereof that will terminate such
Registration Rights Agreement as of the Effective Time, which amendment has
been made available to Parent. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding
securities or instruments that contain any redemption or similar provisions,
and there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Other than the Company Equity Awards issued prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities, commitments or agreements of
any character obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any additional
shares of capital stock of the Company (including any rights plan or
agreement) or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, call, right,
convertible security, commitment or agreement. Section 3.3(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all
Company Equity Awards outstanding as of May 10, 2017, specifying, on a holder-
by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the number of shares
subject to each such Company Equity Award, (iii) the grant date of each such
Company Equity Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan under which such Company
Equity Award was granted, (v) the exercise price for each such Company Equity
Award that is a Company Stock Option, and (vi) the expiration date of each
such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option.

    

12

 



    



  

(g) There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or
other agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the
voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of
the Company. The Company does not have in effect a "poison pill" or similar
stockholder rights plan (other than any such plan as to which the rights
granted thereunder have expired).

  



  

3.4 Authority. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate actions on the part of the Company's Board of Directors.

Mergers, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, are in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has directed that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the

adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. No other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than the
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Voting Common Stock (the
"Requisite Company Vote"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity,
whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity (collectively, the
"Enforceability Exceptions").

  



  

3.5 No Violations. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming that the
consents, approvals and filings referred to in _Section 3.6 _ have been
obtained and the applicable waiting periods have expired, violate any law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or
license (each, a "Law") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their respective properties) is subject, (ii) violate the Articles of
Incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the similar organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) constitute a breach or violation
of, or a default under (or an event which, with due notice or lapse of time

accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, indenture, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument
or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or
to which any of their respective properties or assets may be subject, except
(in the case of clause (iii) above) for such breaches, violations,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations which, either individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

the Bank Merger. As of the date hereof, the Company has no knowledge of any
reason pertaining to the Company why any of the approvals referred to in this
_Section 3.6_ should not be obtained without the imposition of any condition
or requirement described in _Section 7.1(c)_.

  



  

3.7 Governmental Filings. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has timely filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents that it has been required to file since January 1, 2014 with
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or any state regulatory
authority (collectively, "Regulatory Agencies") and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith. As of their respective
dates, each of such filings complied in all material respects with all laws or
regulations under which it was filed (or was amended so as to be in
compliance promptly following discovery of such noncompliance).

3.8 Securities Filings. The Company has timely filed with or
furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules, registration statements,
definitive proxy statements and other documents that it has been required to
file under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or
the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 (collectively, "Company SEC Reports").
An accurate and complete copy of each of the Company SEC Reports is publicly
available. No such Company Report, at the time filed or furnished (and, in
the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively) contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of their respective dates, all of the Company SEC Reports
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of the
Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC
Reports.

  



  

3.9 Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Company

Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders'

for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set

adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with

consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since January 1,
2014, no independent public accounting firm has resigned (or informed the
Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

3.10 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any debt, liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise and whether
due or to become due) other than liabilities reflected on or reserved against
in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2017 included
in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017,
except for (i) liabilities incurred since March 31, 2017 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice that, either alone or when
combined with all similar liabilities, have not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (ii)
liabilities incurred for legal, accounting, financial advising fees and out-
of-pocket expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

3.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  



  

(a) Since December 31, 2016, the Company and its Subsidiaries have

course of such businesses consistent with their past practices and there has
not been any event or occurrence that has had, or is reasonably expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(b) Since December 31, 2016, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have taken any action that would be prohibited by clauses
(a)(i), (b)(ii), (c), (d), (i)(iii), (j), (k), (m), (n), or (o) of _Section
5.2_ if taken after the date hereof.

  



  

3.12 Legal Proceedings. Except as would not reasonably be likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any, and there are no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or
executive officers acting in their capacity as such. There are no judgments,
decrees, injunctions, orders or rulings of any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon
consummation of the First-Step Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries). Since January 1, 2014, (i) there have been no subpoenas,
written demands, or document requests received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity and (ii) no Governmental Entity has
requested that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enter into a settlement
negotiation or tolling agreement with respect to any matter related to any
such subpoena, written demand, or document request.

  



  



  

3.13 Absence of Regulatory Actions. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2014, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2014,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Governmental Entity, specific to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, that, in each of any such cases, currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or
risk management policies, its management or its business (each, whether or
not set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, a "Company Regulatory
Agreement"), nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in
writing or, to the Company's knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2014, by any
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or
requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement. Except for examinations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the
ordinary course of business and pursuant to the Company Regulatory Agreements,
no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014. There is no claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or notice of violation
(whether civil, criminal or administrative) pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against any officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of his or her duties as
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

times since January 1, 2014 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses

(b) WashingtonFirst Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or
better in its most recent examination or interim review with respect to the
CRA. The Company does not have knowledge of any facts or circumstances that
would cause WashingtonFirst Bank or any other Subsidiary of the Company to be
deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the
CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating
for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory".

  



  

(c) The Board of Directors of WashingtonFirst Bank (or where
appropriate of any other Subsidiary of the Company) has adopted, and
WashingtonFirst Bank (or such other Subsidiary of the Company) has
implemented, an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and

Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program
meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA
PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and WashingtonFirst Bank (or such
other Subsidiary of the Company) has complied in all material respects with

federal law and regulation and common law. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of the Company or of any of
its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct in all material respects and
accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

Subsidiaries for all years up to and including 2013 have been examined by

effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a
material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in

proceedings regarding any material Tax of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries for which adequate reserves
have not been established. No claim has been made in writing by any
Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct, and

reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each Company
Contract. To the Company's knowledge each third-party counterparty to each
Company Contract has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by it to date under such Company Contract, and no
event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time
or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of the Company or

and trademarks material to its business. With respect to each item of
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
owner possesses all right, title and interest in and to the item, free and
clear of any Lien. With respect to each item of Intellectual Property that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use,
the license, sublicense or agreement covering such item is legal, valid,
binding, enforceable and in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or
notice alleging any interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation
with or of any intellectual property rights of a third party (including any
claims that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain
from using any intellectual property rights of a third party). To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into
conflict with any intellectual property rights of third parties and no third
party has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come
into conflict with any intellectual property rights of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property"
means trademarks, service marks, brand names, internet domain names, logos,
symbols, certification marks, trade dress and other indications of origin, the
goodwill associated with the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction
of, and applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing,
including any extension, modification or renewal of any such registration or
application; patents, applications for patents (including
divisions, continuations, continuations in part and renewal applications),
all improvements thereto, and any renewals, extensions or reissues thereof,
in any jurisdiction; trade secrets; copyrights and registrations or

3.18 Labor Matters. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in material
compliance with all applicable Laws respecting employment, retention of
independent contractors, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, and wages and hours. There are no complaints, lawsuits,
arbitrations, administrative proceedings, or other proceedings of any nature
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries brought by or on behalf of any applicant for
employment, any current or former employee, any person alleging to be a
current or former employee, any class of the foregoing, or any Governmental
Entity, relating to any such Law, or alleging breach of any express or
implied contract of employment, wrongful termination of employment, or
alleging any other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection
with the employment relationship. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is or has ever been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization with respect to its
employees, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any
proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or
seeking to compel it or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages and conditions of employment nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, has any such proceeding been threatened, nor is there any
strike, other labor dispute or organizational effort involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened.

Company Employee Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Employee Plans" means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3)

compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance plans, programs or
arrangements or other contracts or agreements to or with respect to which the
Company or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001 of ERISA (a "Company ERISA Affiliate"), is a party or has any current or
future obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company ERISA Affiliate. There has been no announcement or commitment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to create an additional Company Employee
Plan, or to amend any Company Employee Plan, except for amendments required
by applicable Law or which do not materially increase the cost of such Company
Employee Plan.

  



  

(b) The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent
true and complete copies of each Company Employee Plan along with, where
applicable, copies of and the following related documents, to the extent
applicable: (i) the most recent copy of any summary plan descriptions,
amendments, modifications or material supplements to any such Company Employee

last two (2) plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination

23

 



    



  

(c) Each Company Employee Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the IRC. Since
January 1, 2014, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary
correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan, and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would
qualify for correction under any such program.

  



  

(d) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened litigation, administrative action or proceeding relating to any
Company Employee Plan. All of the Company Employee Plans comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the IRC and
other applicable laws. There has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC) with respect to
the Company Employee Plans that is likely to result in the imposition of any
penalties or Taxes upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section
502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC.

  



  

(e) The Company has never sponsored, implemented or participated in
any defined benefit pension plan or multiple-employer plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA.

  



  

(f) Section 3.19(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each Company Employee Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the IRC (a "Company Qualified Plan"). Each Company
Qualified Plan has received a favorable determination letter or a prototype
plan or volume submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS for the
most recent applicable remedial amendment cycle, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
letter. No Company Qualified Plan is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as
defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC).

  



  

(g) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the IRC) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the IRC, has
(i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and IRS Notice
2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the IRC. Each
Company Employee Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not qualified under Section 401(a)
or 403(a) of the IRC is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA as
an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA and
the Company has filed a "top hat" registration letter with the Department of
Labor for each such plan.

  



    

24

 



    



  



  

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for post-retirement or post-employment benefits under any Company
Employee Plan that cannot be amended or terminated upon sixty (60) days'
notice or less without incurring any liability thereunder, except for
coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the IRC,
or similar state laws, the cost of which is borne by the insured individuals.

  



  

(i) All contributions required to be made with respect to any
Company Employee Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or
other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect
to insurance policies funding any Company Employee Plan, for any period
through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full, or to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected in the financial statements of the Company. Each Company
Employee Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of
ERISA either (A) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the IRC or (B) is
unfunded.

  



  

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness
to, any employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or
limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee
Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC.

  



  

(k) No Company Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the IRC, or
otherwise. The Company has made available to Parent preliminary copies of
Section 280G calculations (whether or not final), which to the best of its
knowledge are true, correct and complete, with respect to any disqualified
individual who is a "named executive officer" of the Company as defined in
Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



    

25

 



    



  

3.20 Real Property. The Company or a Company Subsidiary (a) has good
and marketable title to all the real property reflected in the latest audited
balance sheet included in the Company SEC Reports as being owned by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or acquired after the date thereof (except
properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business) (the "Company Owned Properties"), free and clear
of all material Liens, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet
due, (ii) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto
or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at
such properties and (iv) such imperfections or irregularities of title or
Liens as do not materially affect the value or use of the properties or
assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations at such properties (collectively, "Permitted
Encumbrances"), and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in
the latest audited financial statements included in such Company SEC Reports
or acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that have expired by
their terms since the date thereof) (the "Company Leased Properties" and,
collectively with the Company Owned Properties, the "Company Real Property"),
free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to Company's knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of Company, threatened condemnation proceedings against the
Company Real Property. Each lease pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as lessee, leases any Company Leased Property is valid and in
full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the Company's knowledge, any other party to any such lease, is in
default or in violation of any material provisions of any such lease. To the
knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures or other
improvements located on any Company Real Property encroaches upon or over any
adjoining parcel or real estate or any easement or right-of-way.

  



  

3.21 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the Company has
received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will
be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to
the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio (as
set forth in _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ ) in the First-Step Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock. Such opinion
has not been amended or rescinded in any material respect as of the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

3.22 Fees. Other than for financial advisory services performed for
the Company by Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., pursuant to a letter agreement,
a true and complete copy of which has previously been provided to Parent,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees,
commissions or finder's fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

3.23 Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have
complied, with any federal, state or local Law relating to: (i) the
protection or restoration of the environment or natural resources, (ii) the
handling, storage, use, presence, disposal, release or threatened release of,
or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or (iii) noise, odor, wetlands,
indoor air, pollution, contamination or any injury to persons or property
from exposure to any hazardous substance (collectively,
"Environmental Laws"). There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions, or investigations of any nature pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, before any court, governmental
agency or board or other forum against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition, on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or
obligation arising under any Environmental Law and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or investigation. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice, demand letter, executive or administrative order,
directive or request for information from any Governmental Entity or any
third party indicating that it may be in violation of, or liable under, any
Environmental Law.

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate only to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
information supplied, or to be supplied, by the Company for inclusion in
applications to Governmental Entities to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate in all material
respects.

  



  

3.31 Internal Controls.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to
maintain accountability for assets, and (iii) access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization.

  



    

30

 



    



  

(b) The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the Company by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and (y) has
identified and disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Parent. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to
believe that the Company's outside auditors and its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

  



  

(c) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of the Company, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to the
knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the Company.

  



  

3.32 Data Privacy. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in place
commercially reasonable data protection and privacy policies and
procedures to protect, safeguard and maintain the confidentiality, integrity
and security of (i) their information technology systems and (ii) all
information, data and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted
thereby, including personally identifiable information, financial
information, and credit card data (as such information or terms are defined
and/or regulated under applicable Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines
of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the "Company
Data"), against any unauthorized or improper use, access, transmittal,
interruption, modification or corruption, except where the failure to have in
place such policies and procedures has not had and would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with applicable federal and state confidentiality and data
security Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity
or Regulatory Agency including, without limitation, Title V of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as
the provisions of the information security program adopted by the Company
pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364, and all industry standards applicable to the
Company Data, including card association rules and the payment card industry
data security standards, except where such failure to be in compliance has
not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as has
not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there currently are
not any, and since January 1, 2014, have not been any, pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, claims or written complaints with
respect to unauthorized access to or breaches of the security of (i) any of
the Company's or its Subsidiaries' information technology systems or (ii)
Company Data or any other such information collected, maintained or stored by
or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any unlawful
acquisition, use, loss, destruction, compromise or disclosure thereof).

    

31

 



    



  



  

3.33 Tax Treatment of the Integrated Mergers. The Company has not
taken any action, and has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating
to it, that would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the IRC.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

  



  

Except (i) (i) as disclosed in Parent SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2015
and prior to the date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) and (ii) as disclosed in disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent
Disclosure Schedule") (which schedule sets forth, among other things, facts,
circumstances and events the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of the representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV, or to one or more of Parent's
covenants contained in Articles V or VI (and making specific reference to the
Section of this Agreement to which they relate); _provided_ , that (x) no
such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (y) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that such item represents
a material exception or fact, circumstance or event or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (z) disclosure
in any paragraph of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the
indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is
reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to another
paragraph of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or another Section of this
Agreement), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

  



    

32

 



    



  

4.1 Organization and Qualification. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Maryland, is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding
company under the BHC Act and has not elected to be treated as a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Parent has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the
business currently being conducted by it. Parent is duly qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by
it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent engages only in activities (and
holds properties only of the types) permitted to bank holding companies by the
BHC Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

4.2 Subsidiaries.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent's Subsidiaries (including, without limitation,
Merger Sub) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the
business currently being conducted by it and is duly qualified or licensed as
a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the

its operations other than in connection with or as contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.4 Authority.

  



  

(a) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate actions on the part of Parent's Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Integrated Mergers, on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, are in the best
interests of Parent and its stockholders and has directed that the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger be
submitted to Parent's stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such
stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the
shares of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Meeting to approve the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger (the
"Requisite Parent Vote"), no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger have been validly
authorized (subject to the attainment of the Requisite Parent Vote), when
issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no current
or past stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right or similar
rights in respect thereof.

  



  

(b) Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
approved by the Board of Directors and sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no
other proceedings on the part of Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Merger Sub, enforceable against Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

4.5 No Violations. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming that the
consents, approvals and filings referred to in _Section 4.6_ have been
obtained and the applicable waiting periods have expired, violate any Law to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
properties) is subject, (ii) violate the Articles of Incorporation or
bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) constitute a breach or violation of,
or a default under (or an event which, with due notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default under), or result in the termination of,
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
indenture, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or to which
any of their respective properties or assets may be subject, except (in the
case of clause (iii) above) for such breaches, violations, terminations,
accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

    

35

applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal
Reserve under the BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and

(viii) the filing with the Nasdaq Stock Market of a notification of the
listing of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step
Merger, no consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Entity or any third party are required to be made or obtained in
connection with the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Integrated
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Bank Merger. As of the date hereof, Parent has no knowledge of any reason
pertaining to Parent why any of the approvals referred to in this _Section
4.6_ should not be obtained without the imposition of any condition or
requirement described in _Section 7.1(c)_.

  



  

4.7 Governmental Filings. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and other
documents that it has been required to file since January 1, 2014 with the
Regulatory Agencies and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith. As of their respective dates, each of such filings
complied in all material respects with all laws or regulations under which it
was filed (or was amended so as to be in compliance promptly following
discovery of such noncompliance).

  



  

4.8 Securities Filings. Parent has timely filed with or furnished to
the SEC all reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive
proxy statements and other documents that it has been required to file under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 (collectively,
"Parent SEC Reports"). An accurate and complete copy of each of the Parent SEC
Reports is publicly available. No such Parent Report, at the time filed or
furnished (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, all of the Parent SEC
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of Parent
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

    

36

 



    



  

4.9 Financial Statements. The financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent
SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders'
equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit
adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in

in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since
January 1, 2014, no independent public accounting firm has resigned (or
informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

4.10 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any debt, liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise and whether
due or to become due) other than liabilities reflected on or reserved against
in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent as of March 31, 2017 included in
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017,
except for (i) liabilities incurred since March 31, 2017 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice that, either alone or when
combined with all similar liabilities, have not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (ii) liabilities
incurred for legal, accounting, financial advising fees and out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2016,
Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in the ordinary and usual course of such businesses consistent with their past
practices and there has not been any event or occurrence that has had, or is
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

4.12 Legal Proceedings. Except as would not reasonably be likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers
acting in their capacity as such.

  



    

37

 



    



  

4.13 Absence of Regulatory Actions. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or
directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has
been since January 1, 2014, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or
since January 1, 2014, has adopted any policies, procedures or board
resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Governmental Entity, specific
to Parent or its Subsidiaries, that, in each of any such cases, currently
restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any
material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends,
its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business (each,
whether or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, a "Parent
Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised in writing or, to Parent's knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2014,
by any Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement. Except for
examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency
in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to Parent Regulatory
Agreements, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or
operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014. There
is no claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or notice of violation
(whether civil, criminal or administrative) pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against any officer or director of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of his or her duties as an
officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.14 Compliance with Laws.

  



  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times
since January 1, 2014 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights and
assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith), and, to the knowledge of Parent, no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or
authorization is threatened. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have since
January 1, 2014 complied in all material respects with and are not in material
default or violation under any Law applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including (to the extent applicable to Parent or
its Subsidiaries), all laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA
PATRIOT Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair
Housing Act, the CRA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act
and Regulation Z, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any regulations promulgated by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the
Interagency Policy Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment
Products, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, and any other Law relating to
bank secrecy, discriminatory or abusive or deceptive lending or any other
product or service, financing or leasing practices, money laundering
prevention, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and all agency requirements relating to the origination, sale and
servicing of mortgage and consumer loans. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been given notice or been charged with any violation of, any
Law which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

    

38

 



    



  

(b) Sandy Spring Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or
better in its most recent examination or interim review with respect to the
CRA. Parent does not have knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would
cause Sandy Spring Bank or any other Subsidiary of Parent to be deemed not to
be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory". To the
knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2014, no non-public customer information
has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner
which would cause either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any
remedial action. The Board of Directors of Sandy Spring Bank (or where
appropriate of any other Subsidiary of Parent) has adopted, and Sandy Spring
Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Parent) has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate
customer identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326
of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the
requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act
and the regulations thereunder, and Sandy Spring Bank (or such other
Subsidiary of Parent) has complied in all material respects with any
requirements to file reports and other necessary documents as required by the
USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

  



  

4.15 Taxes.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns in
all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and
all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect.

  



  

(b) All Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown
on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid or adequate
reserves therefor have been made on the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC
Reports (including the related notes, where applicable).

  



  

(c) The federal income Tax Returns of Parent and its Subsidiaries
for all years up to and including 2013 have been examined by the IRS or are
Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. No
deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been proposed,
asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
pending or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations,
investigations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of Parent and
its Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries for which
adequate reserves have not been established. No claim has been made in writing
by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that Parent or such Subsidiary is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

    

39

 



    



  

(d) Parent has made available to the Company true, correct, and
complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or
gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due
and payable) on any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among Parent and its Subsidiaries). Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Parent) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the
two (2) year period ending on the date hereof or otherwise as part of a "plan
(or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of
the IRC of which the Integrated Mergers is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the IRC) in a distribution of stock intended to be governed in
whole or in part by Section 355 of the IRC.

  



  

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a

deduction from, taxable income in any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of
accounting, (ii) closing agreement, (iii) intercompany transaction or excess
loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the IRC
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv) installment
sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date outside of the
ordinary course of business.

  



  

(k) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party, and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
complied with all applicable information reporting requirements under Part
III, Subchapter A of Chapter 61 of the IRC and similar applicable state and
local information reporting requirements.

    

40

 



    



  



  

(l) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
1.6011-4(b)(1).

  



  

4.16 Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Employee Plans" means
all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or
not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted
stock, stock unit, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs
or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plans, programs or arrangements or other contracts or agreements to or with
respect to which Parent or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which
together with Parent would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate"), is a party or
has any current or future obligation or that are maintained, contributed to
or sponsored by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Parent ERISA Affiliate.

  



  

(b) Each Parent Employee Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the IRC. Since
January 1, 2014, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary
correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Parent Employee Plan, and neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

  



  

(c) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
litigation, administrative action or proceeding relating to any
Parent Employee Plan. All of Parent Employee Plans comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the IRC and other
applicable laws. There has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC) with respect to Parent
Employee Plans that is likely to result in the imposition of any penalties or
Taxes upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the IRC.

  



  

(d) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Parent
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has
not been satisfied in full, and Parent is not aware of any condition that
exists that would, or would be reasonably likely to, result in Parent
incurring any such liability.

  



    

41

 



    



  

(e) No Parent Employee Plan or employee plans maintained by any
Parent ERISA Affiliate has experienced any "reportable events," as such term
is defined under ERISA Section 4043, for which a waiver has not been granted,
has had any "accumulated funding deficiencies," as such term is defined under
ERISA Section 302(a)(2) (prior to amendment by P.L. 109-280) or IRC
Sections 412(a) or 4971 (whether or not waived), nor for years after
amendment by P.L. 109-280 any "funding shortfalls" as defined in IRC Section
430(c).

  



  

(f) Each Parent Employee Plan that is an "employee pension benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC (a "Parent Qualified Plan") has
received a favorable determination letter or a prototype plan or volume
submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS for the most recent
applicable remedial amendment cycle, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there
are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such letter. No
Parent Qualified Plan is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC).

  



  

(g) Each Parent Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the IRC) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the IRC, has
(i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and IRS Notice
2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the IRC.

  



  

(h) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Parent Employee Plan, for any period through
the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full, or to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected in the financial statements of Parent. Each Parent Employee Plan
that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either
(A) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the IRC or (B) is
unfunded.

  



  

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness
to, any employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or limitation
on the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate
or receive a reversion of assets from any Parent Employee Plan or related
trust.

insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of
Parent reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry
practice, and Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any such
policy. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the

premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all

filings or approvals under applicable state securities laws, or any filing
pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12
under the Exchange Act will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate only to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The information supplied, or to be supplied, by Parent for inclusion in
applications to Governmental Entities to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate in all material
respects.

  



  

4.24 Internal Controls.

  



  

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to
maintain accountability for assets, and (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization.

  



  

(b) Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (y) has identified and disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent's outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parent's Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent's
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to
Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that
Parent's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer
of Parent.

commercially reasonable data protection and privacy policies and
procedures to protect, safeguard and maintain the confidentiality, integrity
and security of (i) their information technology systems and (ii) all
information, data and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted
thereby, including personally identifiable information, financial
information, and credit card data (as such information or terms are defined
and/or regulated under applicable Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines
of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the "Parent Data"), against
any unauthorized or improper use, access, transmittal, interruption,
modification or corruption, except where the failure to have in place such
policies and procedures has not had and would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable federal
and state confidentiality and data security Laws, policies, agreements, and
guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency including, without
limitation, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security
program adopted by Parent pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364, and all industry
standards applicable to the Parent Data, including card association rules and
the payment card industry data security standards, except where such failure
to be in compliance has not had and would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Except as has not had and would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, there currently are not any, and since January 1, 2014, have not been
any, pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, claims or written
complaints with respect to unauthorized access to or breaches of the security
of (i) any of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' information technology systems or
(ii) Parent Data or any other such information collected, maintained or
stored by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or any
unlawful acquisition, use, loss, destruction, compromise or disclosure
thereof).

4.26 Tax Treatment of the Integrated Mergers. Parent has not taken any
action, and has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to it, that
would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the IRC.

Covenants

  

6.1 Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries' officers, directors or
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries, discussions or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish
any information or data regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an
inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations, or otherwise communicate in any way with any
person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or Representatives of Parent or Merger
Sub), regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, in
the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.1(a)_ , it may,
and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and
participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board
of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided by the prior sentence, the
Company shall have provided such information to Parent and shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no more
favorable to such person than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company.

  



  

(b) As used in this Agreement,

  



  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer with
respect to, or third party indication of interest in, any of the
following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder): (1) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (2) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the Company's consolidated assets or twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company in a single
transaction or series of transactions; (3) any tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities
of the Company; and

    

51

 



    



  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written offer or
proposal made by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) (1) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of
all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company; (2)
would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders
of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things,
the nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory
approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond, or in addition to, those specifically
contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining
financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the Integrated Mergers and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (3) is reasonably likely
to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(c) The Company will promptly notify (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) Parent of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof, including, in each case, the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the
material terms and conditions thereof, and shall provide to Parent any
written materials received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent of any developments, discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

  



  

(d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not release any third party from, or
waive any provisions of, any confidentiality agreements or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality
or standstill agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party in accordance with the terms thereof. Unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

  



    

52

 



    



  

6.2 Advice of Changes. Prior to the Closing, each party shall
promptly advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent that it
has knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
the failure by it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

  



  

6.3 Access to Information.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford the other party such reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records
(including, without limitation Tax Returns), contracts, properties, personnel
and to such other information relating to itself and its Subsidiaries as the
other party may reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by any party in this Agreement. No
party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the entity in
possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate and reasonable
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(b) All information and documents obtained pursuant to this _Section
6.3_ be held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the provisions of confidentiality set forth in a letter agreement, dated
January 15, 2017 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

  



  

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

(d) From and after the date hereof, Representatives of Parent and
the Company shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for
the conversion of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' data processing and
related electronic informational systems to those used by Parent and its
Subsidiaries with the goal of conducting such conversion as soon as reasonably
practicable following the consummation of the Bank Merger.

6.4 Applications; Consents.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof all necessary applications,
notices and filings to obtain all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all Governmental Entities that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger).
The Company and Parent shall furnish each other with all information
concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
Subsidiaries' directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
application, notice or filing made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult with the other on, all the information relating to Parent and the
Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Entity pursuant to this _Section 6.4(a)_. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Each party will provide the other with
copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to
filing, other than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that
contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information
filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each
party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
shall give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of
the parties hereto shall, and they shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent,
authorization or approval of any third party that is required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.5 Antitakeover Provisions. None of the Company, Parent or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Integrated
Mergers, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall
take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Integrated Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any
applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover
Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



    

54

 



    



  

6.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to
do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible,
including using efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
extensions, waivers, consents and approvals from all applicable Governmental
Entities, effecting all necessary registrations, applications and filings
(including, without limitation, filings under any applicable state securities
laws) and obtaining any required contractual consents and
regulatory approvals.

  



  

6.7 Publicity. Parent and the Company shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, and (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan. Except in respect of any announcement required by (i)
applicable Law, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an
obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, Parent and the Company agree to consult with each other and to
obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary shall issue any
communication of a general nature regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to employees (including general communications relating to
benefits and compensation) without prior consultation with Parent and, to the
extent relating to post-Closing employment, benefit or compensation
information, without the prior consent of Parent or issue any communication of
a general nature to customers without the prior approval of Parent.

  



  

6.8 Stockholder Meetings.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent Meeting" and the
"Company Meeting," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required in
connection with this Agreement and the First-Step Merger and, if so desired
and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought
before an annual or special meeting of stockholders to approve a merger
agreement or otherwise approve the transactions contemplated hereby, and each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of
each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the stockholders of Parent and the Company, as the case may be,
the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the Requisite Company
Vote, in the case of the Company, including by communicating to its respective
stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve (i) this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of the Company and (ii) the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step
Merger, in the case of Parent.

  



    

55

 



    



  

(b) Subject to _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, if the Board of
Directors of Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good
faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend approval of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step
Merger, then in submitting such issuance of shares to its stockholders, the
Board of Directors of Parent may (but shall not be required to) submit the
share issuance to Parent's stockholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Parent may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to Parent's
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by Law.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ , if the Board of
Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in
good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement,
then the Board of Directors of the Company may fail to make such
recommendation, or withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may
not be rescinded or amended); _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
Parent at least three (3) business days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors
of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent (it being
understood that Parent shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.8(c)_ and
will require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.8(c)_.

  



  

(d) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the
Company or Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or
the Requisite Parent Vote.

  



    

56

 



    



  

6.9 Registration of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file the Joint Proxy Statement with
the SEC and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. The
Company will furnish to Parent the information required to be included in the
Form S-4 with respect to the Company's business and affairs and shall have
the right to review and consult with Parent and approve the form of, and
any characterizations of such information included in, the Form S-4 prior to
its, or any amendment or supplement thereto, being filed with the SEC. Parent
and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long
as is necessary to consummate the First-Step Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the First-Step Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, any comments on or correspondence related to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 from the SEC, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by Parent with the SEC and disseminated by the Company and
Parent to their respective stockholders.

  



  

(b) Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the First-Step Merger and
each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall notify The Nasdaq
Stock Market of the additional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued by
Parent in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

6.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, under any contract material to the financial condition,
properties, businesses or results of operations of each party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any Subsidiary is a
party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or occurrence which
individually or in the aggregate has, or which, so far as reasonably can be
foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the other party of any notice or other communication from any third
party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    

57

 



    



  

6.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause to
be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for
the benefit of all persons who are employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is
not specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing
Employee") that, in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the
employee benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries;
_provided, however,_ in no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions
providing that the Company's health and welfare plans as set forth on the
Company Disclosure Schedule will be terminated effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time (or such later date as requested by Parent or as may be
required to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements
contained in such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all
corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related
arrangements effective on the same date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents
shall terminate under any of the Company's health and welfare plans prior to
the time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries and their dependents and,
consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in coverage.
Continuing Employees who become covered under health plans, programs and
benefits of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid under the Company's health plan for the plan
year in which coverage commences under Parent's health plan. Terminated
Company employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Parent in accordance with the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

  



  

(c) For purposes of vesting and determination of eligibility to
participate under Parent's compensation and benefit plans, programs or
policies (other than any plan that is frozen as to participation), each
Continuing Employee who is eligible to participate in such plans, programs or
policies shall receive credit for service with the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of any doubt, that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent (x) that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service or (y) prohibited under
Parent's compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies. Continuing
Employees shall not receive prior service credit for benefit accrual purposes
under any of Parent's compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies,
except for Parent's paid time off program.

  



    

58

 



    



  

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to
terminate the Company's 401(k) plan effective as of the day immediately prior
to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. Upon
termination of the 401(k) plan all participants will be 100% vested in their
account balances. If requested in writing by Parent, the Company will also
take all necessary steps to file or cause to be filed all necessary documents
with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the
Company's 401(k) plan. The Company shall, or shall direct the fiduciaries of
the Company's 401(k) plan to (to the extent permitted by law), provide Parent
and its counsel with a draft of each resolution, amendment, participant
communication or other document relating to the termination of the Company's
401(k) plan at least five (5) business days before such document is
adopted, distributed or filed, and no such document shall be adopted,
distributed or filed without Parent's approval (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall take any and all
actions as may be required to permit the Continuing Employees to roll over
their account balances (excluding loans) in the Company's 401(k) plan into
Parent's 401(k) plan.

  



  

(e) Parent agrees that each full time Company employee who is
involuntarily terminated by Parent (other than for cause as determined by
Parent) within twelve (12) months of the Effective Time and who is not
covered by a separate severance, change in control, or employment agreement
shall, upon executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined
by Parent, receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the
rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at the
Company, with a minimum payment equal to four (4) weeks of base pay for
Company employees who have one (1) full year or less of service as of
their date of termination and a maximum equal to twenty-six (26) weeks of
base pay. For purposes of calculating the number of years of service,
fractional years of service shall be rounded up or down to the nearest full
year, except for purposes of determining eligibility to receive a severance
payment. For purposes of calculating base pay, Company employees who are paid
on an hourly basis shall be deemed to have a base pay equal to the employee's
average weekly compensation over the two months prior to the
termination date. For employees whose compensation is determined in whole or
in part on the basis of commission income, "base pay" shall include base
salary or total hourly wages paid plus commissions earned during the most
recent twelve (12) months ended as of the date of termination of employment.

  



  

Any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who has or is a party
to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement
or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment that may
be triggered by the First-Step Merger or the Bank Merger shall not
receive the severance benefits as provided in this _Section 6.11(e)_ but will
receive the payment specified in such agreement.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director, independent contractor or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or
service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary
or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the first sentence of _Section 9.11_
, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any person, including without limitation any current or former
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any
spouse or dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

    

59

 



    



  

(g) Effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor in accordance with their
terms all employment, severance, change in control and other compensation
agreements and arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their employees, which are not terminated in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
accrued and vested benefit obligations through the Effective Time which are
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their current or
former directors, officers, employees or consultants.

  



  

6.12 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Party"), and any person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the
request of any such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or
partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee
benefit plan or other entity or (ii) any matters arising in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent such
person would have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted by applicable Law, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides a signed written undertaking to
repay such advances if the person is not entitled to mandatory indemnification
and it is ultimately determined that such person has not met the relevant
standard of conduct.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 6.12(a)_, upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. Any
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under
_Section 6.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure.

  



    

60

 



    



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with respect to
claims against such persons arising from facts or events occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend annually pursuant to this _Section 6.12(c)_ more than
three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance (the "Premium Cap") and, if Parent is unable to
maintain such policy as a result of this proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available by payment of such amount; _provided
further_ , that Parent may (i) request the Company to obtain an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor "tail"
policies the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such persons than the Company's
existing insurance policies as of the date hereof if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such
case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such
successor and assign of Parent and its successors and assigns assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her representatives.

  



  

6.13 Litigation and Claims. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Plan of Bank Merger
or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions
taken or to be taken by Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

6.14 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any
such holder receives in exchange therefor in the First-Step Merger.

    

61

 



    



  

6.15 Corporate Governance. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) increase the size of its Board of Directors to fifteen
(15) members, (ii) appoint Joseph S. Bracewell, Shaza L. Andersen and two (2)
additional current members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Company Directors"), to be designated by Parent after consultation with the
Company, to its Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies and
(iii) appoint Joseph S. Bracewell and Shaza L. Andersen to the Executive
Committee of Parent's Board of Directors. Effective as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause Sandy Spring Bank to (i) increase the size of its Board of
Directors to fifteen (15) members, and (ii) appoint Joseph S. Bracewell,
Shaza L. Andersen and two (2) additional current members of the Board of
Directors of the Company, to be designated by Parent after consultation with
the Company, to its Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting
of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies. The
Boards of Directors of Parent and Sandy Spring Bank shall take appropriate
actions to permit such nominations and service under, and subject to the terms
of, their respective Bylaws. The Board of Directors of Parent shall take
appropriate actions to cause the Company Directors to be nominated to
stand for election by Parent's stockholders at Parent's next annual meeting
of stockholders, with Joseph S. Bracewell nominated as a Class I director
with a term expiring at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders and the other
Company Directors nominated to such classes as the Nominating Committee shall
determine so that the number of directors in each class is as nearly equal
as possible. Thereafter, Parent will apply its normal governance and
nomination procedures to the re-election of incumbent directors. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Article III, Section 3 of its bylaws
to be amended, as of the Effective Time, to read in its entirety as set forth
in _Exhibit D_ _._

  



  

6.16 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Parent and the
Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
Company Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the First-Step Merger, and

ARTICLE VIII

  

Termination

  



  

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
Integrated Mergers abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, by
action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating
party, either before or after the obtainment of the Requisite Parent Vote or
the Requisite Company Vote:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; or

  



  

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if (i) the Company shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened
Company Meeting or at any adjournment thereof at which a vote on the adoption
of this Agreement was taken or (ii) if Parent shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Parent Vote at the duly convened Parent Meeting or at any
adjournment thereof at which a vote on the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger was taken; or

  



  

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if either (i) any approval,
consent or waiver of a Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied and
such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable
order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

  



  

(d) by either Parent or the Company, in the event that the First-
Step Merger is not consummated by the first anniversary of this
Agreement, unless the failure to so consummate by such time is due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; or

    

66

 



    



  

(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the party seeking
termination is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), in the event of a breach of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the other party shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.2(a)_ and _(b)_ or _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , as the case may be, would
not be satisfied and such breach or untrue representation or warranty has not
been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to
the party committing such breach or making such untrue representation or
warranty; or

  



  

(f) by the Company, prior to the time the Requisite Parent Vote is
obtained, if the Board of Directors of Parent shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of Parent approve
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-
Step Merger, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to the Company, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm
such recommendation within two (2) business days after the Company requests in
writing that such action be taken or (ii) breached its obligations under
_Section 6.8_ in any material respect; or

  



  

(g) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm
such recommendation within two (2) business days after Parent requests in
writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance
of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company Common Stock that
has been publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an affiliate of Parent)
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof,
(ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) breached its
obligations under _Sections 6.1_ or _6.8_ in any material respect; or

  



  

(h) by the Company, if the Parent Average Price is less than $34.00,
_subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences. If the Company
elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ ,
it shall promptly (and in any event no later than the last day of the three
(3) day period commencing on the fifth business day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) notify Parent in writing of such election. During the three
(3) day period commencing with Parent's receipt of such notice, Parent shall
have the option to (i) increase the Exchange Ratio to equal $32.30 divided by
the Parent Average Price or (ii) pay, as part of the Merger Consideration, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x) $32.30 minus (y) the
Parent Average Price multiplied by .9500 (the "Additional Cash Payment"). If
within such three (3) day period, Parent delivers written notice to the
Company that it intends to proceed with the Integrated Mergers by paying such
additional consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and
notifies the Company of the revised Exchange Ratio or Additional
Cash Payment, then no termination shall be permitted by, or shall have
occurred pursuant to, this _Section 8.1(h)_ , and this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange
Ratio shall have been so modified, and any references in this Agreement to
the Merger Consideration shall thereafter include any Additional Cash
Payment).

    

67

 



    



  

8.2 Termination Fee.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(g)_ , the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, a fee in the amount of $18,500,000 (the "Termination Fee").

  



  

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ , Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Termination Fee.

  



  

(c) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management or the
Board of Directors of the Company or shall have been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (i) (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ without the
Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, and (ii) prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.2(c)_, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-
five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)".

  



  



  

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ , and, in order
to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, then such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the
other party (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit. The amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and
_(c) _ constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except in the
case of fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the sole remedy of the party
receiving such payment in the event of termination of this Agreement on the
bases specified in such sections.

  



  

8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and there shall be
no liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective officers and
directors, except that (i) _Sections 6.3(b) and 8.2_ and Article IX, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

Merging

  



  

Touchdown Acquisition, Inc.,

  



  

a Virginia corporation,

  



  

with and into

  



  

WashingtonFirst Bankshares Inc.,

  



  

a Virginia corporation

  



  

1. The Merger. Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Merged Corporation") and wholly owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Parent"), shall, at the Effective Time (as defined below), be merged (the "Merger") with and into WashingtonFirst Bankshares Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"). The parties shall file Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the "VSCA") with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

  



  

2. Effective Time; Effects of the Merger.

  



  

(a) The Merger shall become effective at the date and time (the
"Effective Time") specified in the Articles of Merger.

  



  

(b) The Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the
Merger and shall continue its existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of the Merged Corporation shall terminate.

  



  

(c) The Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721
of the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Company shall possess
all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Merged Corporation and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Merged Corporation.

  



  

3. Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Merged Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and attached hereto as _Exhibit 1_ , until such Articles of Incorporation are thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

  



  

4. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, shall be the Bylaws of the Merged Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

5. Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Merged Corporation Common Stock and Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, the Merged Corporation or any holder of any shares of the common stock or other capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Merged Corporation:

  



  

(a) Merged Corporation Common Stock. At and after the Effective
Time, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Merged Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company ("Company Voting Common Stock") and each share of the Non-Voting
Common Stock, Series A of the Company ("Company Non-Voting Common
Stock," and, together with the Company Voting Common Stock, the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, other than (i)
Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock
owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, by Parent, the Company or a
Subsidiary of either (collectively "Excluded Shares"), shall become and be
converted into a number of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") as follows:

  



  

(i) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $53.23, the Exchange
Ratio shall equal .8210;

  



  

(ii) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $50.15 and equal to
or less than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient of $43.70
divided by the Parent Average Price;

  



  

(iii) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $37.07
and equal to or less than $50.15, the Exchange Ratio shall equal .8713;

  



  

(iv) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $34.00
and less than $37.07, the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient of
$32.30 divided by the Parent Average Price; and

  



  

(v) if the Parent Average Price is less than $34.00, the Exchange
Ratio shall equal .9500.

  



  

"Parent Average Price" shall mean the volume-weighted average price per
share, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent, of Parent Common Stock on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days
ending on (and including) the fifth business day immediately preceding the
closing of the Merger, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or any
successor thereto, through its "volume weighted average price" function (or,
if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Parent and the Company). The Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
is sometimes referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

  



    

 | A-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(c) Parent Capital Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

  



  

(d) No Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be issued in the Merger;
instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Parent Average Price.

  



  

(e) Anti-Dilutive Adjustments. If, between the date of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of May 15, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement") by and
among Parent, the Merged Corporation and the Company and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(f) Excluded Shares. As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

6. Treatment of Company Equity Awards

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted by the Company under a Company Stock Plan (as defined
below) or assumed by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Option") shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without
interest), no later than the first payroll period following the Effective Time
and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the
closing date of the Merger, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Equity Award Cash-out Price (as defined below) over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option
less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the
Equity Award Cash-out Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Equity
Award Cash-out Price" means an amount equal to the product of (x) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Price.

  



    

 | A-3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Restricted Stock Award"
and, together with the Company Stock Options, the "Company Equity Awards")
shall fully vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ of this
Plan of Merger. Parent shall pay or issue the consideration described in this
_Section 6_ within five (5) business days following the Effective Time.
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Company Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code or any provisions of
state, local, or foreign tax law.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Plan of Merger, "Company Stock Plans" means
the WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and the
1st Portfolio Holding Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.

  



  

7. Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the holders of certificates, or evidence of shares in book entry form,
representing Company Common Stock ("Old Certificates"), for exchange in
accordance with this _Section 7_ , (a) certificates, or at Parent's option,
evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the Parent Common Stock
("New Certificates"), to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to  _Section 5(b)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of such
Company Common Stock, and (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 5(d)_ (such New
Certificates and cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

  



    

 | A-4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Company Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 5, a letter of
transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration which such holder shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to,
_Section 5(b)_ , and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to _Section 7(b)(iii)_. From and after the Effective Time, upon proper
surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or
Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Merger Consideration to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to, _Section 5(b)_ , and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old
Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ and (2) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 7(b)(iii)_ , and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old
Certificates or any dividends payable under _Section 7(b)(iii)_. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 7(b)_ , each Old Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this _Section 7(b)_.

  



  

(ii) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by
it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer
of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to
the transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing such Company
Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Exchange
Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  



    

 | A-5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(iii) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Old
Certificates in accordance with this _Section 7(b)_. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, upon the surrender of
such person's Old Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive any
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent
to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock represented by such person's Old Certificates.

  



  

(iv) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of
any shares of Company Common Stock other than to settle transfers of Company
Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange
Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this _Section 7(b)_.

  



  

(v) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant
to _Section 5(b)_ , any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant
to this _Section 7(b)_ or any proceeds from any investments thereof that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the
written request of Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 7(b)_ shall
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof)
shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(vi) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
Company's stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Old Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

  



    

 | A-6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

8. Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Voting Common Stock. Each share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is owned by a holder who (i) shall not have voted or caused or permitted any of his, her or its shares to be voted in favor of the Merger, and (ii) pursuant to Section 13.1-729 _et seq._ of the VSCA, duly and validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with respect to his, her or its shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof, with respect to such Dissenting Shares, shall be entitled to payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of the VSCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly and validly exercise or perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights, each share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock of such holder as to which appraisal rights were not duly and validly exercised or perfected, or were effectively withdrawn or lost, shall not be deemed a Dissenting Share and shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Plan of Merger.

  



  

9. Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Plan of Merger may be amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing between the Company, the Merged Company and Parent (which writing shall expressly state the intent to amend or modify this Plan of Merger) except that, after the vote by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment or modification may be made that would reduce the amount or alter or change the kind of consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock or that would contravene any provision of the VSCA or the applicable state and federal banking laws, rules and regulations.

  



  

10. Abandonment. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger may be abandoned, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

chosen in such manner as is prescribed by the bylaws of such Subsidiary or
other enterprise or determined by the board of directors of such Subsidiary

enterprise that is not a corporation or is organized in a foreign
jurisdiction, the term "officer" shall include in addition to any officer of
such entity, any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of

Form of Article III, Section 3 of Parent Bylaws

  



  

Section 3. _Age Limitation_. No person shall be eligible for election or
appointment to the board of directors if such person is under twenty-one (21)
or over seventy-two (72) years of age at the time of his or her election or
appointment. No director shall serve beyond the annual meeting of shareholders
immediately following his or her seventy-second (72nd) birthday. This

director emeritus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director may, at the
request of the Nominating Committee and if ratified by the Board, continue to
serve as a director after the annual meeting of shareholders immediately
following his or her seventy-second (72nd) birthday if (i) he or she was
appointed to the board of directors in connection with a
corporate acquisition, consolidation, or merger and (ii) the Nominating
Committee and Board determine that his or her continued service would be of
substantial benefit to the Corporation in recognizing the benefit of such
acquisition, consolidation or merger. The continuation of such person's
service as a director shall be for such period as the Nominating Committee,
subject to the approval of the Board, shall determine.
