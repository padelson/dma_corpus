</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 <U>Regulatory Matters</U>. (a)&nbsp;Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare a proxy
statement/prospectus (the &#147;<U>Proxy Statement</U>&#148;) to be mailed to the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to be filed by Parent in a
registration statement on Form S-4 (the &#147;<U>Registration Statement</U>&#148;) with the SEC. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and the Company shall thereafter mail or deliver
the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or &#147;Blue Sky&#148; permits and approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions,
filings and requests for waivers thereof (including, to the extent necessary, any notification
required by the HSR Act), to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations and waivers of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality
of information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations and waivers of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any noncustomary condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
(measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) on either
Parent or the Company (a &#147;<U>Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition</U>&#148;). For purposes of
the Agreement, &#147;Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition&#148; shall not include (A)&nbsp;any action,
condition or restriction that requires (i)&nbsp;Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (which for purposes
hereof, shall include the Thrift) to comply with the terms of the business plan to be filed by
Parent with the OTS (the &#147;<U>Business Plan</U>&#148;) as part of its application

Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply.

provided, however, that for purposes hereof, the continued provision of benefits under the Employee
Benefit Plans (other than the Company Equity Plans or the ESOP) following the Effective Time shall
be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standard, it being understood that, at Parent&#146;s discretion, the
Covered Employees may commence participating in the plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries at
different times with respect to different plans. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent agrees to
honor in accordance with their terms all Employee Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements, provided
that such plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or suspended in accordance with their
terms.
