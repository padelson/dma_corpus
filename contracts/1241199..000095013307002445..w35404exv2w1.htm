 (a) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the combination, and the Company shall cooperate in such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of any party pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked
pursuant to Article II (a " _Stock Election_ "), the right to receive the
Floating Exchange Ratio; and (c) for each share of Company Common Stock other

" _Parent Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest one

the ten trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 (d) _Equity Awards_. 

   

 (i) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised under the Companys Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Option Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ " and, together with the RRPTA (defined below), the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive promptly after the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars (without interest) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Option Cash Out Amount over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.

 (ii) _Plan Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Plan Share (as defined in the Companys Amended and Restated 2003 Recognition and Retention Plan and Trust Agreement, the " _RRPTA_ ") subject to a Plan Share Award (as defined in the RRPTA), shall be deemed vested and earned, shall be distributed in the form of Company Common Stock (on a one for one basis) and each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated in the manner contemplated by _Section 1.4(b)_; provided, however, that such shares shall be treated as Non-Election Shares.

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

   

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION  

  

 2.1 _Election Procedures; Deposit of Merger Consideration_. If applicable, each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (" _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article II_, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: 

  

 (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. 

  

 (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of Election_ ") which shall be mailed to record holders of Company Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (c) Parent shall make the Form of Election initially available not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any shareholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to Company shareholders, shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; provided, that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole discretion and any shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date that Parent and the Company shall agree is as near as practicable to five (5) business days prior to the expected Closing Date. 

  

 (e) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of 

   ##### 

  

    

Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Parent
shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not
properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (neither
Parent nor the Company nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify
any shareholder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not
in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless
a proper Election is thereafter timely made. 

  

 (f) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. 

  

 (g) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Company shareholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (h) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 2.3)_ (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4_ hereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, who did not properly complete and submit an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or 

   ##### 

  

    

paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 1.4(e)_ upon
surrender of such Certificates and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed Form of Election or
a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
(elected or deemed elected by it, subject to, and in accordance with _Section
1.4_) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_, and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_
or  _Section 2.3_) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any amount payable pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ or _Section 2.3_.
Until such time as a certificate or evidence of shares in book entry form, as
the case may be, representing Parent Common Stock is issued to or at the
direction of the holder of a surrendered Certificate, such Parent Common
Stock shall be deemed not outstanding and shall not be entitled to vote on
any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a Person (as defined in _Section 3.9_) other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. 

  

 2.3 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to  _Section 1.4(e)_ hereof, until such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this  _Article II_. Subject to applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ or _Section 2.3_ shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 2.5 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3_, in each case without interest thereon. 

  

 2.6 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 2.7 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis, provided, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former shareholders of the Company after the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

  

 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Plan Shares, immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 2.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_, 

   ##### 

  

    

cash for fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

  

 Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (excluding any risk factor disclosure contained in such Company SEC Reports under the heading "Risk Factors," "Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995," "Forward-Looking Statements" or any similar sections and any disclosure of risks that are predictive or forward looking in nature) where it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to one or more representations or warranties contained in _Article III_, or (ii) the disclosure schedule (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this _Article III_, or to one or more of the Companys covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another section of this Agreement, and _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

Revenue Service Notice 2005-1 and (iii) to the extent applicable, the final
regulations issued thereunder (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together, the "

2004, as amended (the " _AJCA_ "), has been "materially modified" within the

a good faith reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities,
other than amendments to comply with Section 409A of the Code. All Company
Options were granted at an exercise price at least equal to the fair market

 (h) (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. 

  

 (i) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

  

 (j) Section 3.11(j) to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) an accurate and complete description of each provision of any Employee Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with 

   ##### 

  

    

any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery
of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)) or benefit to any employee,
officer, consultant or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
result in the forgiveness of indebtedness, or could limit the right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan, Employment Agreement or
trust, and (ii) a good faith estimate of the "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could become payable by the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) and the "base amount"
for any person with respect to whom such "parachute payments" could
become payable (in each case within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code).

 (l) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or administrative proceedings which have been asserted or instituted, and to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim, lawsuit, investigation or administrative proceeding against the Employee Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Employee Benefit Plan or any participant in an Employee Benefit Plan. 

  

 (m) Each individual who renders services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under Employee Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized. 

  

 (n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (o) The Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") is an "employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Section 3.11(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) each loan under which the ESOP is a borrower (each, an " _ESOP Loan_ "), (ii) the lender and guarantor (if any) of each ESOP 

   ##### 

  

    

Loan, and (iii) the securities of the Company that were acquired with such
ESOP Loan (the " _Employer Securities_ "). Each ESOP Loan meets the
requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of the Code. The Employer Securities are
in each case pledged as collateral for the ESOP Loan with which they were
acquired, except to the extent they have been released from such pledge and
allocated to the accounts of participants in the ESOP in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 54.4975-7 and 54.4975-11. 

  

 (p) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

The Company and its Subsidiaries have all primary, excess and umbrella policies of general liability, fire, workers compensation, products liability, completed operations, employers, liability, health, bonds and other forms of insurance providing insurance coverage that is customary in amount and scope for other companies in the industry in which they operate. Each of such policies and other forms of insurance is in full force and effect on the date hereof and shall (or comparable replacements or substitutions therefor) be kept in full force and effect by the Company through the Effective Time. All such policies, considered collectively with other such policies providing the same type of coverage, are sufficient for compliance with all requirements of law and of all requirements under contracts or leases to which the Company is a party in all material respects. All premiums currently payable or previously due and payable with respect to all periods up to and including the Effective Time have been paid to the extent such premiums are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof and, with respect to premiums not due or payable at or prior to the date hereof, all premiums due and payable prior to the Effective Time, will have been paid prior to the Effective Time and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all Employee Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements, provided that such plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or suspended in accordance with their terms.

 (c) The ESOP shall be terminated as of the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, and all shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP shall be treated in the manner contemplated by  _Section 1.4(b)_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the ESOP trustee shall sell a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock from the ESOPs unallocated Company stock suspense account to repay the ESOP Loan, with such sale to comply with all applicable securities laws. As soon as practicable after the date of the Agreement, the Company shall file a request for a determination letter from the IRS regarding the continued qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination. Prior to and following the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination letter, including but not limited to making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed allocation described below as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter. As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Time or the receipt of the favorable determination letter from the IRS, the Company and the ESOP trustee shall cause (i) any shares of Parent Common Stock and cash remaining in the ESOP suspense account after the repayment of the ESOP Loan described above to be allocated to the accounts of the ESOP participants and their beneficiaries who have account balances in the ESOP in accordance with the applicable provisions of the ESOP, and (ii) the account balances of all ESOP participants and their beneficiaries to be either distributed in a lump sum or transferred in accordance with the Code.

    ##### 

  

    

respective Subsidiaries, pursuant to its terms or interfere with Parent or the
Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to conform with applicable law (including, without limitation,
Section 409A of the Code); or (iii) limit the right of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Covered Employee at any time.

Prior to the end of the fifteenth day following the date hereof, the Company shall provide Parent with a proposed list of Retention Pool participants along with proposed dollar amounts for payments to each such participant.

 (d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.8_.

 6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_  that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.10_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

   

 6.11 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) Until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.11_ and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Acquisition Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to (A) consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, and (B) withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation, in each case if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") and (C) approve or recommend, or enter into (and, in connection therewith, effect a Change in Recommendation), a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited, bona

its Affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors, agents
or representatives has violated any of the provisions of this _Section
6.11_, (2) the Company provides Parent with written notice indicating that
the Company, acting in good faith, believes that the Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and, therefore, plans to
conduct a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purpose
of considering whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall be delivered to Parent at least three business
days prior to the date of such meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Company, (3) during the three business day period after the Company
provides Parent with the written notice described in clause (2) above, the
Company shall cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good
faith with Parent in an effort to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal would not
constitute a Superior Proposal and, therefore, the Company would be required
to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby on such adjusted terms,
(4) notwithstanding the negotiations and any adjustments pursuant to clause
(3) above, the Board of Directors of the Company makes the determination
necessary for the Acquisition Proposal to constitute a Superior Proposal,
(5) notwithstanding the negotiations and any adjustments pursuant to clause
(3) above, the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (6)
not later than the earlier of the approval or recommendation of, or the
execution and delivery of a definitive agreement with respect to, any such
Superior Proposal, the Company (I) terminates this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(h)_, (II) makes the payments required to be made pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ and (III) delivers to Parent a written certification duly
executed by each other party to such Superior Proposal pursuant to which each

the amounts so payable.

No action requested by Parent to be taken pursuant to this  _Section 6.14_ shall be required to be taken if, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, such action (taken individually or collectively with any other action requested pursuant to this  _Section 6.14_ or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement) (1) (A) would materially jeopardize either the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (B) would materially jeopardize the status of the Company as a unitary savings and loan holding company or the status of the Thrift as a federally chartered savings association; or (2) such action would be in contravention of any applicable law, organizational document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as relevant, or in contravention of any Company Material Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.14, the Company shall not be required to take any action requested to

be taken by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ unless and until Parent

immediately with the Merger, and that all conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under _Article VII_ have been satisfied and Parent
provides to the Company any other evidence reasonably requested by the
Company to confirm that the Merger will occur. No action taken by the Company
at Parents request under this _Section 6.14_ nor the results of such action
shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement. For purposes of _Sections 5.2(v)_ and
_7.2(e)_ , and this _Section 6.14_, "Subsidiaries" shall also include
any entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (taking into account this sentence)

 6.18 _Fill Option_. In the event that, as of the Determination Date, both of the following conditions (the " _Fill Conditions_ ") are satisfied: 

   

 (a) the Average Closing Price shall be less than 85% of the Parent Starting Price; and 

   

 (b) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Parent Starting Price (such number, the " _Parent Ratio_ ") is less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number, the " _Index Ratio_ "), 

    ##### 

  

    

then the Company and Parent shall discuss in good faith whether to make an
appropriate adjustment to the Exchange Ratio. If Parent and the Company
mutually agree on an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement to
"Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as
adjusted by the mutual agreement of the parties pursuant to this _Section
6.18_ (any such mutual agreement to adjust the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
this _Section 6.18_ the _"Fill Option_ "). If the parties cannot mutually

ARTICLE VIII 

   

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT  

  

 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company: 

   

 (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its respective entire Board of Directors; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent if (i) any Governmental Entity that must grant a regulatory approval required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (c) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the nine month anniversary of the date of this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 (d) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a) or (b)_ or _7.3(a) or (b)_ , as the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period; 

   

 (e) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of the Company if the Company shall have failed to obtain the Company Shareholder Vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; _provided_ that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to it if it has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under _Sections 6.1(a)_,  _6.3_ or _6.11_ ; 

   

 (f) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Proxy Statement the approval and adoption of this Agreement, (ii) in a manner adverse to Parent, (x) withdrawn, modified or qualified, or proposed to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and/or the Merger to the Companys shareholders, or (y) recommended or endorsed any Alternative Proposal (or, in the case of clause (ii), resolved to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof or (iii) knowingly breached its obligations under _Sections 6.3_ or _6.11_ in any material respect; 

   

 (g) by the Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company so determines by the vote of a majority of all of its members, by giving written notice to Parent not later than the end of the fifth Business Day next following the Determination Date, in the event that, as of the Determination Date, both of the Fill Conditions are satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ shall occur if the Company and Parent shall have mutually agreed to exercise the Fill Option pursuant to _Section 6.18;_ 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) by the Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have approved or recommended, or the Company shall have executed or entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 6.11(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination under this _Section 8.1(h)_ shall not be effective until the Company has made the payment required by _Section 8.3(c)(ii)_; or 

   

 (i) By Parent, in the event that either (i) Parent shall have entered into, following the date hereof, an agreement with respect to a merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction that would constitute an "Alternative Transaction" (as defined herein, but with (X) each reference to the Company and Company Common Stock in such definition being deemed a reference to Parent and Parent Common Stock, (Y) each reference to "(other than Parent or its Affiliates)" and "(other than the Merger)" being deemed to be deleted, and (Z) each reference to "25%" or "75%" being deemed to be a reference to "50%"), or (ii) the Average Closing Price of the Parent Common Stock is less than $20.00; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such termination under this _Section 8.1(i)_ shall not be effective until Parent has made the payment required by _Section 8.3(c)(iii)_. 

   

 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the Company, Parent, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that (i) _Sections 6.2(b)_, _8.2_ , _8.3_ , _9.2_ , _9.7_ and  _9.8_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement and the solicitation of shareholder approvals and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ then Parent shall pay the Expenses incurred by the Company up to $700,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if at the time of such termination the Company is in material breach of its obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement, then (i) Parent shall not pay the Expenses incurred by the Company, and (ii) the Company shall pay the Expenses incurred by Parent up to the Maximum Amount. 

    ##### 

  

     

 The " _Maximum Expense Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expenses incurred by Parent, up to $700,000 (the " _Expense Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), and (b) the recipient has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is or will not be Qualifying Income, as applicable), in each case as determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives a reasoned opinion from outside counsel or a ruling from the IRS (" _Tax Guidance_ ") providing that Parents receipt of the Expense Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ "), the Maximum Expense Amount shall be an amount equal to the Expense Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent, as the case may be, has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Expense Amount within five business days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Expense Amount due to the above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow (with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to both Parent and Company) by wire transfer within three days of termination and the relevant escrow agreement shall include instructions not to release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Expense Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above or in the relevant Tax Guidance within five business days after the Company has been notified thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Maximum Expense Amount shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Maximum Expense Amount terminates shall be released to the Company. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 

   

 (i) in the event that a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ (provided that prior to such termination the Company Shareholder Vote has not been obtained) or _Section 8.1(e)_ or this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (B) following any such termination but prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters into any acquisition or other similar agreement, including any letter of intent, related to any Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date of such consummation or the date upon which the Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee equal to the Break-up Fee by wire transfer of same day funds. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h) then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee by wire transfer of same day funds on the date of termination. 

   

 (iii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then Parent shall pay the Company $40,000,000 (the " _Reverse Break-up Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds on the date of termination. 

   

 (iv) For purposes of this _Section 8.3_, a " _Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event_ " shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal (the term Alternative Transaction, as used in the definition of Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 8.3_, and as used in this _Section 8.3_ , shall have the same meaning set forth in _Section 6.11_ except that the references to "more than 25%" and "at least 75%" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more" and "a majority," respectively); 

  

The " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Base
Amount (as defined below) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be
paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (a) the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) Parent
has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Parent
which is or will not be Qualifying Income, as applicable), in each case as
determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that
Parents receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements, the Break-Up Fee shall be an amount equal to the Base Amount
and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax
Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Base Amount within five Business Days. In
the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Base Amount due to the
above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow (with
an escrow agent reasonable acceptable to both Parent and Company) by wire
transfer within three days of termination and the relevant escrow agreement
shall include instructions not to release any portion thereof to Parent
unless and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following
once or more often: (i) a letter from Parents independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
(calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which
events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or
the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above or in the
relevant Tax Guidance within five Business Days after the Company has been
notified thereof. The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be compensation and
liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining
damages under the circumstances and neither Party shall have any other
liability to the other after the payment of the Break-Up Fee. The obligation
of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate
on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of
this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the 

  ##### 

  

   

Company to pay the Break-Up Fee terminates shall be released to the Company.
As used in this  _Section 8.3(c)_, the " _Base Amount_ " shall mean
$24,000,000. 

   

 (d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b) or (c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other party for the fee set forth in this  _Section 8.3_, the sued party shall pay to the suing party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made; _provided_ , _however_ , that such payments due Parent, if any, (taking into account any other payments required to be made pursuant to this _Section 8.3)_ shall not exceed the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (i) the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (ii) the recipient has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to Parent (provided that payments may be made pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) if the requirements set forth in 8.3(b) and (c) above relating to the receipt of a letter from Parents independent accountants or Tax Guidance are met with respect to such payments). 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall be obligated, subject to the terms of this Section 8.3, to pay only one Break-up Fee, and Parent shall be obligated, subject to the terms of this Section 8.3, to pay only one Reverse Break-up Fee. 

   

 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law and _Section 1.1(b)_, this Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which by applicable law requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

   

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or 

    ##### 

  

    

condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.
