under applicable law; (D)&nbsp;at least four Business Days prior to furnishing any information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such Person, Stratasys gives Objet written notice of the identity of such Person and of Stratasys&rsquo;s
intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and no earlier than four Business Days after
Objet&rsquo;s receipt of such notice, Stratasys commences negotiations with such Person regarding and obtains from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions (including nondisclosure provisions and use restrictions) at least
as favorable to Stratasys as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement; and (E) concurrently with furnishing any information to such Person, Stratasys provides a list to Objet of such
information and, to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by Stratasys to Objet or made available to Objet,
Stratasys concurrently furnishes such information to or makes such information available in an electronic data room to Objet. Without
limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section&nbsp;5.2.1 by any Representative or Subsidiary
of Stratasys shall be deemed a breach of this Section&nbsp;5.2.1 by Stratasys for all purposes of this Agreement.</TD></TR></TABLE>

annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.
For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of
Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, (i) the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation,
(ii) such other business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL, (iii) if the stockholder, or the beneficial
owner on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, has provided the corporation with a Solicitation Notice (as defined
in this Section 5(b)), such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the case of a proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and
form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation&rsquo;s voting shares required under applicable law to carry
any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders
of a percentage of the corporation&rsquo;s voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or beneficial owner to be sufficient
to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either case, have included in such
materials the Solicitation Notice, and (iv) if no Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this
section, the stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies
sufficient to have required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this Section 5. To be timely, a stockholder&rsquo;s
notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business
on the ninetieth (90<SUP>th</SUP>) day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120<SUP>th</SUP>) day
prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year&rsquo;s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date
of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary
of the preceding year&rsquo;s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the
close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120<SUP>th</SUP>) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close
of business on the later of the ninetieth (90<SUP>th</SUP>) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10<SUP>th</SUP>) day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement
of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder&rsquo;s notice as described above.
Such stockholder&rsquo;s notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposed to nominate for election or
reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;1934 Act&rdquo;) and Rule 14a-4(d) thereunder (including such person&rsquo;s written
consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (B) as to any other business
that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they
appear on the corporation&rsquo;s books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which
are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such stockholder or
beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of the proposal, at least the
percentage of the corporation&rsquo;s voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination
or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the corporation&rsquo;s voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (an affirmative
statement of such intent, a &ldquo;Solicitation Notice&rdquo;).</P>

At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these
Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of
a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders
present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by statute, or
by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote
of a majority of shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the
meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided
by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares
present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled
to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where
otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the outstanding shares
of such class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized,
shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by
statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of
the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable,

Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to directors

by this Bylaw to a director or officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent
jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim
is made within thirty (30) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation
shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it
permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In
connection with any claim by an officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advancement
of expenses, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such
person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was lawful. <B> </B>Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel

is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable
law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders)
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification
or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified,
or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article XI or otherwise shall be on the corporation.</P>

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, devisees, legatees,

Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to <U>Sections</U> <U>3</U> and <U>4</U> may be assigned in connection with
any transfer or assignment by a Holder of Registrable Securities; <U>provided</U>, that: (i) such transfer may otherwise be effected
in accordance with applicable securities laws; (ii) such transfer is effected in compliance with the restrictions on transfer contained
in this Agreement (in particular, in Section 2) and in any other agreement between the Company and the Holder; and (iii) such assignee
or transferee executes this Agreement or (B) holds (after giving effect to such transfer) at least one percent (1%) of the issued
and outstanding Ordinary Shares. No transfer or assignment will divest a Holder or any subsequent owner of any rights or powers
hereunder unless all Registrable Securities are transferred or assigned. If the Ordinary Shares shall be exchanged for or replaced
by securities of another Person, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Person to expressly assume all of
the Company&rsquo;s obligations hereunder, to the extent applicable.</P>

not be adequate to compensate the non-breaching party. Accordingly, the Company agrees that each Holder shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce its rights hereunder. The right to equitable relief, including an injunction, shall not be limited by any other
provision of this Agreement. In any action or proceeding against it seeking an injunction or other equitable relief to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, the Company hereby (i) waives and agrees not to assert any defense that an adequate remedy exists
at law or that a Holder would not be irreparably harmed and (ii) waives and agrees not to seek any requirement for the posting
of any bond or other security in connection with any such action or proceeding.</P>
