## SECTION 1.01. _The Exchange._ On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Business Corporation
Act of the State of Texas (the " _BCA_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.04), (i) Parent and the Company shall effect the Exchange and
(ii) the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions._ The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Exchange and the other transactions contemplated by the

## 

  

## SECTION 1.03. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Exchange
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth

following the later of: (i) the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
Law (as defined in Section 3.06), waiver by all parties) of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in
Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as
soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article VII have
been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties
entitled to the benefits thereof); or (ii) February 8, 2006, or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.04. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of

## 

  

## SECTION 1.05. _Effects._ The Exchange shall have the effects set forth in

2   

     
   

  



  

# ARTICLE II 
  
 Effect on the Capital Stock of the Company; Exchange of Certificates

  



  

## SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Exchange and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by the Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash
or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange of Company Common Stock._ (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(a)
and 2.01(d), at the Effective Time each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than any such shares owned by Parent) shall be
transferred by operation of Law to Parent in exchange for the right to the
Exchange Price.

  

### 

  

(2) The cash payable upon the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) is referred to collectively as the "
_Exchange Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive Exchange
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest. Each owner of a beneficial interest in any such share
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights against the Company
with respect to such share of Common Stock.

  



  

### (c) _Parent Shares._ Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Company shall issue to Parent a certificate evidencing all issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than any such shares owned
at the Effective Time by Parent).

  

### 

  

### (d) _Dissent Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissent Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Dissent Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Article
5.12 of the BCA (" _Article 5.12_") shall not be transferred to Parent for
the Exchange Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(b), but rather the
holders of Dissent Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Dissent Shares in accordance with Article 5.12 in exchange for the
transfer of their Dissent Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to receive payment of fair value under Article 5.12, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissent Shares shall
cease and such holder shall be entitled to receive the Exchange Consideration
as provided in Section 2.01(b) in exchange for such shares. All Dissent
Shares shall be transferred by operation of Law to Parent at the Effective
Time. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received
by the Company

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

### for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all responses, negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
response to or payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates. _ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company to act as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Exchange
Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing Company Common
Stock. Parent shall provide to the Paying Agent immediately prior to the
Effective Time all cash necessary to pay the Exchange Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.01(b) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  

## 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
transferred to Parent for the Exchange Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(b) (the " _Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery of the Exchange Consideration shall be effected only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Exchange Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash for which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate were transferred pursuant to Section 2.01(b),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, for which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate have been transferred pursuant to
Section 2.01(b). No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person in
whose name the Certificate is registered on the Companys books, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to issue in exchange

  

### 

  

4   

     
   

  



  

### for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Exchange Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The
Exchange Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon the transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights of the former legal and
beneficial holders thereof pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
_subject_ , _however_ , to the Companys obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and
after the Effective Time there shall be no registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the right to the Exchange
Consideration represented by the Certificates. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates are presented to the Company or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Exchange Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to
five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which Exchange Consideration in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise become abandoned property or escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.06)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund in U.S. government securities maturing in
not more than 30 days or other instruments of comparable liquidity and
credit-worthiness, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, and any
losses shall be at the sole risk of Parent.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.

# ARTICLE III 
  
 Representations and Warranties of the Company

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), and subject to Section 9.07, the Company represents and warrants
to Parent that:

  



  

## SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of the Company and
each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ )
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company, a material adverse effect on the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to consummate the Exchange and the other Transactions (a "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company and each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or its ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary or the failure to so qualify has had or is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent copies, certified by the
Companys secretary to be true and complete, of the articles of incorporation
of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the
" _Company Charter_ "), and the by-laws of the Company, as amended to the
date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company By-laws_ "), and the
comparable charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary,
in each case as amended through the date of this Agreement. The "Member Asset

### (b) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified, and any
trusts forming a part thereof, have been the subject of determination letters
from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Pension
Plans and trusts are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such
determination letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Company Pension Plan been
amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or application
therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification,
materially increase its costs or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.

such determination letter and each pending application for a determination
letter.

  

### 

  

### (c) No Company Pension Plan, other than any Company Pension Plan that is
a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Company Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "), had, as of the respective last
annual valuation date for each such Company Pension Plan, an "unfunded
benefit liability" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of
ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to Parent,
and there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition of
any Company Pension Plan since its last such annual valuation date. None of
the Company Pension Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether
or not waived, and there has not been any application for a waiver of minimum
funding standards with respect to any Company Pension Plan. None of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, any officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
including the Company Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any

### Company Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or
502(l) of ERISA. None of such Company Benefit Plans and trusts has been
terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
during the last five years. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms
are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the
effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any
Multiemployer Pension Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, (i) no such Company Benefit Plan is self-insured, unfunded or
funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code), (ii) no such Company Benefit Plan provides benefits
after termination of employment, except as required by 4980B(f) of the Code
and (iii) each such Company Benefit Plan (including any such Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) may be amended or terminated without
material liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiary on or at any
time after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (e) Other than payments that may be made to the persons listed in the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Primary Company Executives_ "), any amount
that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the Exchange or any other Transaction by any current
or former Related Person of the Company or any of its affiliates who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement,
other compensation arrangement or Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement would not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no disqualified individual is
entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any other person in the event that the excise Tax under Section
4999 of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual. Set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter is (i) the estimated maximum amount that could be
paid to each Primary Company Executive and the estimated number of shares of
the Companys Common Stock which would become vested in such Primary Company
Executive (including in each case tax gross-up payments with respect thereto)
as a result of the Exchange and the other Transactions under all employment,
severance and termination agreements, other compensation arrangements,
Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements currently in effect and
(ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for
each Primary Company Executive calculated as of the date of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of the Exchange and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof will not, (i) entitle any Related Person of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any additional compensation,
severance or other benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company

the other Transactions) will be nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the
Code.

  

### 

  

### (h) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan or

as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the Company

and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Parent shall cause the Existing Indemnification Obligations to be performed
