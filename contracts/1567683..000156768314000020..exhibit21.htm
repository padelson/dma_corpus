ARTICLE 2

SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND CLOSING

2.01 Purchase and Sale. Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser
agrees to purchase from Seller, all of the right, title and interest of Seller
in and to the Acquired Interests at the Closing on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

2.02 Payment of Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth, in consideration of the delivery by Seller of the
Acquired Interests, Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
United States funds, shall pay to Seller at the Closing an amount equal to (i)
Two Hundred Million dollars ($200,000,000), which amount shall include the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount and which may be reduced pursuant
to Section 5.06 (the "Base Purchase Price"), plus (ii) the Closing Date
Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (whether a positive or a
negative amount) (such sum the "Preliminary Purchase Price"), subject to
adjustment to reflect the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount (whether
a positive or a negative amount) in accordance with Section 2.04 (such
adjusted amount, the "Final Purchase Price").

2.03 Closing. 

(a) The closing of the transactions described in Section 2.01 (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Jones Day, counsel to Seller, at 51
Louisiana Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20001, or at such other place as the
Parties mutually agree, at 10 A.M. local time, upon the fulfillment or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8.

(b) At the Closing, the following shall occur:

(i) Purchaser shall pay the Preliminary Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Seller's account as provided on Exhibit B;

(ii) The Parties shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other Parties
the certificates and other deliverables pursuant to Articles 7 and 8; and

(iii) The execution by both Parties of the Assignment of Membership Interests.

2.04 Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,
Seller will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet setting forth
Seller's good faith estimate of the Aggregate Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount"), as well
as a computation thereof (which computation shall be prepared in the same
format and on the same basis used to prepare the Aggregate Target Net Working
Capital Amount as set forth on Exhibit C). If (i) the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount is greater than the Aggregate Target Net Working
Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased
by an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount and the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount;
and (ii) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is less than the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price payable
at Closing will be decreased by an amount equal to difference between the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount (such amount under either (i) or (ii) is referred to as
the "Closing Date Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount").

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare (at
Purchaser's expense) and deliver to Seller a worksheet setting forth
Purchaser's good faith computation of the actual Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount as of the Closing Date (the "Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount"), which computation shall be prepared in the same format and on the
same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount,
together with a reasonably detailed explanation of, and documentation
reasonably sufficient to confirm the accuracy of the computation of, such
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller does
not object in writing thereto to Purchaser, then the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount shall constitute the actual Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount as of the Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement (the
"Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount"). If, within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller
objects in writing thereto to Purchaser (describing in reasonable detail the
specific line items and values that are in dispute and the reasons for such
dispute, and proposing 

alternative values with respect to such specific line items) such Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to the objection and
resolution provisions set forth in Section 2.04(e) below.

(c) If the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is not prepared and
delivered by Purchaser within the thirty (30) day period set forth in Section
2.04(b) above, Seller shall be entitled (but not obligated) during the thirty
(30) day period commencing on the thirty-first (31st) day after the Closing
Date to prepare (at Seller's expense) and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet
setting forth Seller's good faith computation of the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount, which computation shall be prepared in the same format
and on the same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount, and based upon information available to Seller, and
accompanied by the documentation that supports Seller's determinations and
calculations. If within ten (10) days following delivery of such worksheet and
supporting documentation, Purchaser does not object in writing thereto to
Seller, then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount submitted by
Seller pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall constitute the Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount. If, within ten (10) days following delivery of
such worksheet and supporting documentation, Purchaser objects in writing
thereto to Seller (describing in reasonable detail the specific line items and
values that are in dispute and the reasons for such dispute, and proposing
alternative values with respect to such specific line items), such Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to the objection and
resolution provisions set forth in Section 2.04(e) below.

(d) If neither Purchaser nor Seller prepare and timely deliver a Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with Section 2.04(b) or
(c), above, the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount delivered at
Closing shall become the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for all
purposes hereunder.

(e) If Seller timely objects to Purchaser's Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or if Purchaser timely objects to
Seller's Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section
2.04(c), then Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt
to resolve the particular items and values that are identified in the
applicable written notice of objection over a twenty (20) day period
commencing on delivery of written notice of objection pursuant to Section
2.04(b) or (c), as the case may be. Should such negotiations not result in an
agreement as to the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount within such
twenty (20) day period (or such longer period as Purchaser and Seller may
mutually agree), then either Party may submit such disputed items and values
to the Neutral Auditor. Each Party agrees to promptly execute a reasonable
engagement letter, if requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor. Purchaser and
Seller, and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the
Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall resolve such disputed items and determine the values to be
ascribed thereto, and using those values (together with other items not in
dispute) determine the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount as of the
Closing Date only (prepared on the same basis used to prepare the Estimated
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount). The Parties hereby agree that the
Neutral Auditor shall only decide the specific disputed items, the values
ascribed thereto and using those values (together with the other items
included in the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount)
determine the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, and the Neutral
Auditor's decision with respect to such disputed items and values must be
within the range of values assigned to each such item in 

the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and the notice of
objection, respectively. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve the disputed items
and amounts and deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written determination of the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount (such determination to be made
consistent with this Section 2.04(e), including a worksheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by Purchaser and Seller)
within thirty (30) days after being retained, which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their respective Affiliates
and representatives, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in this Section
2.04(e) shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes, if any,
regarding the Aggregate Net Working Capital, if any, and neither Seller nor
Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 11 for
Losses resulting or arising from the amount of the Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount or the determination of Aggregate Net Working Capital.

(f) The "Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount" shall be
calculated by computing the Closing Day Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 2.04(a) but substituting Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. The "Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount" shall be the amount equal to (i) the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount minus (ii) the Closing Date Aggregate Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay in cash to
Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is
a negative amount, then Seller shall pay in cash to Purchaser the amount equal
to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount. Any such net excess or deficit payment in respect of the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount will be due and payable within
fifteen (15) days after the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is
finally determined as provided in this Section 2.04 and will be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
shall be specified by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable. Any payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.04(f) shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(g) Following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and provide
each other and, if applicable the Neutral Auditor, and their respective
representatives, reasonable assistance and access to such books, records and
employees (including those of Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo and the
Subsidiaries) as are reasonably requested in connection with the matters
addressed in this Section 2.04. Consistent with the foregoing, if Purchaser
prepares the worksheet in accordance with Section 2.04(b), Purchaser shall, at
its expense, provide or provide reasonable access (in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to its business) to Seller or the Neutral Auditor to
review the books and records, documents and work papers related to the
preparation of the worksheet and computation of the Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount and if Seller prepares the worksheet in accordance with
Section 2.04(c), then Seller shall, at its expense, provide or provide
reasonable access (in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to its business) to
Purchaser or the 

Neutral Auditor to review the books and records, documents and work papers
related to the preparation of the worksheet and computation of the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If Purchaser prepares the worksheet in
accordance with Section 2.04(b), Seller and the Neutral Auditor shall be
entitled to make reasonable inquiries and information requests of Purchaser
regarding the worksheet setting forth the computation of the Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount and the calculations set forth therein and if
Seller prepares the worksheet in accordance with Section 2.04(c), Purchaser
and the Neutral Auditor shall be entitled to make reasonable inquiries and
information requests of Seller regarding the worksheet setting forth the
computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and the
calculations set forth therein.

operation of the applicable Facility(ies) and is consistent in all material
respects with Seller's budget for the applicable Facility(ies).

circumstance which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

hereof and prior to the satisfaction of all the closing conditions (the
"Satisfaction Date") of the Parties, and the cost of restoring such damaged or
destroyed Facility to a condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition
(net of and after giving effect to any insurance proceeds received by Laredo
HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo or the Subsidiaries for such restoration) (such cost
as estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller
and selected by Purchaser and Seller in good faith and promptly after the date
of the event giving rise to the Casualty Loss, the "Restoration Cost") does
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price, Purchaser shall
reduce the amount of the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.04) by the amount of the Restoration Cost and, subject to the prior written
consent of the Seller, such Casualty Loss shall not affect the Closing;
provided, however, that if Seller does not provide such written consent within
thirty (30) days after the date the Restoration Cost is provided to the
Parties, then Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement
by providing written notice thereof to the Seller. If the Restoration Cost is
in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price, Purchaser may, by
notice to Seller at any time prior to or within thirty (30) days after the
date such Restoration Cost amount is provided to Purchaser elect to either:
(i) subject to Seller's prior written consent, reduce the Base Purchase Price
by the Restoration Cost; or (ii) in its sole discretion, terminate this
Agreement, in the latter case by providing written notice to Seller. To the
extent Purchaser elects and Seller consents to reduce the amount of the Base
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 5.06, Purchaser will, at Seller's
election: (a) assign to Seller any rights to any contribution available under
any rights to insurance claims or recoveries available under insurance
policies covering such Facility; or (b) at Seller's sole cost and expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such available contribution, claims
or recoveries on Seller's behalf for the benefit of Seller, in either case
only up to the amount of such reduction in the Base Purchase Price. During the
period between the Satisfaction Date and the Closing, Seller shall consult
with Purchaser in respect of remediating the Casualty Loss, including promptly
commencing the restoration work with respect to such Casualty Loss and
promptly filing claims with insurance companies under applicable insurance
policies in respect of such Casualty Loss. To the extent Seller, Laredo
HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo or any Subsidiary has made any actual capital
expenditures in respect of the Restoration Cost, the amounts of such actual
capital expenditures, up to the amount equal to the Restoration Cost by which
the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.04) was reduced in
accordance with this Section 5.06, shall be added to the Base Purchase Price
(as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.04).

faith to satisfy each other condition to the obligations of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement and (b) shall not, and shall not permit Laredo

commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as may be necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such
actions at its expense as are necessary in connection with obtaining any
third-party consents and all Governmental Approvals required to be obtained by
Seller. During the Interim Period, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and
provide any information regarding Seller necessary to assist Purchaser in
making any filings or applications required to be made with any Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.09, if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or
arbitration, the furnishing of any documents or information in accordance
herewith shall be solely subject to applicable rules relating to discovery and
the remainder of this Section 5.09 shall not apply.

5.10 Support Obligations. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and certain
Affiliates have provided certain credit support pursuant to the support
obligations and related agreements described on Schedule 5.10 (the "Support
Obligations"). Schedule 5.10 sets forth a true and complete list of all of the
Support Obligations in effect as of the Effective Date. During the Interim
Period, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a
replacement of such Support Obligations with the beneficiaries thereof such
that on the Closing Date Purchaser shall effect the complete and unconditional
release of all of the Support Obligations in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, Seller and the beneficiaries thereof, including by means of a
letter of credit, escrow, posting a bond or cash deposit, or other
arrangements. To the extent that Purchaser cannot cause the release,
termination and replacement of any Support Obligations, Purchaser shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (as applicable) from and
against any and all Losses that may be suffered, incurred or sustained by any
of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting from, arising out of
or relating to any such Support Obligation being in effect on or after the
Closing Date (including as a result of any draw or demand for or making of any
payment by Seller or any such Affiliate of Seller under any Support
Obligation) with respect to the full extent of such Support Obligation and
(ii) diligently continue to seek the release, termination and replacement of
such Support Obligation; provided that Purchaser's indemnification obligations
under clause (i) shall not affect Seller's indemnification obligations under
Section 11.01.

5.11 Real Property Schedule Updating. During the Interim Period, Seller shall
update Schedule 3.14(a) such that as of the Closing, Schedule 3.14(a) lists
all of the material Real Property Rights in the Land held by Laredo HoldCo,
Tapestry HoldCo or the Subsidiaries.

similar obligations of Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo and the Subsidiaries
imposed by the States of Nebraska, Oklahoma or West Virginia or any other
Governmental Authority that are due or become due for Tax periods within which
the Closing Date occurs (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be
apportioned between Seller for the pre-Closing Date period, on the one hand,
and Purchaser for the post-Closing Date Period, on the other hand, as of the
Closing Date, based upon the actual number of days of the Tax period that have
elapsed before and after the Closing Date, and all income Taxes and Transfer
Taxes imposed on Laredo HoldCo and Tapestry HoldCo and the Subsidiaries shall
be allocated between the pre-Closing Date period and the post-Closing Date

the portion of such Apportioned Obligations attributable to the period ending
before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion of
such Apportioned Obligations attributable to the period beginning on or after
the Closing Date. Each Party shall cooperate in assuring that Apportioned
Obligations that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to the preceding
sentences are paid by Seller, and that Apportioned Obligations that are the
responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid
by Purchaser. If any refund, rebate or similar payment is received by Laredo
HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo, the Subsidiaries and/or Purchaser for any real
property Taxes, personal property Taxes or similar obligations referred to
above that are Apportioned Obligations, such refund shall be apportioned
between Seller and Purchaser as aforesaid on the basis of the obligations of
Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo and the Subsidiaries during the applicable Tax
period. Any refund, rebate or similar payment received by Laredo HoldCo,
Tapestry HoldCo, any Subsidiary and/or Purchaser for any income Tax or
Transfer Tax attributable to the pre-Closing Date period, as determined above,
shall be for the benefit of Seller; and any such refund, rebate or similar
payment attributable to the post-Closing Date period, as determined above,

timely prepare and file with the appropriate authorities all Tax Returns
required to be filed by Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo or the applicable
Subsidiary. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely prepare and
file with the appropriate authorities all other Tax Returns required to be
filed by Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo and the Subsidiaries.

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, employees and agents reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo and the
Subsidiaries, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records that are necessary for the preparation of any Tax Returns that the
Party is required to file under this Article 9, and in resolving all disputes
and audits with respect to such Returns.

(d) All sales, use transfer, controlling interest transfer, recording, stock
transfer, real property transfer, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees
("Transfer Taxes"), if any, arising out of or in connection with the

shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. Tax Returns that must be filed in 

connection with such Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed by the Party
primarily or customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing

provide such Tax Returns to the other Party at least ten (10) business days

Subsidiaries (in each case to the extent treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) among Laredo HoldCo's, Tapestry HoldCo's and the
Subsidiaries' assets consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Seller and Purchaser agree that the agreed allocation
shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values
and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax returns,
including, without limitation, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and that
neither Seller nor Purchaser or their respective Affiliates will take
positions inconsistent with such allocation in notices to any Governmental
Authority, in audits or other proceedings with respect to Taxes, or in other
documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

9.03 Treatment for Tax Purposes. For federal and applicable state and local
income tax purposes, the Purchaser and Seller shall treat the Purchaser's

to which any of them become subject, resulting from, arising out of or related

Deductible shall not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (i) any willful breach of any representation or warranty, or (ii)
fraud. 



(b) Neither Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other Indemnified
Party in connection with any single item or group of related items that result

Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

(c) The aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Parties under this Article 11
resulting from breaches of representations or warranties herein and in any
certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall be limited to an amount equal to

shall not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)

other premium adjustments reasonably attributable thereto) and the amount of
any Tax benefit (which for this purpose means any reduction in cash Taxes
payable that would otherwise be due or the receipt of a refund of Taxes by the
Indemnified Parties, in each case only with respect to the taxable year in
which the Loss was incurred or paid) to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim or the facts or events giving rise to such indemnity obligation. If
the Indemnified Party realizes such Tax benefit after the date on which an
indemnity payment has been made to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly make payment to the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal
to such Tax benefit; provided, that such payment shall not exceed the amount

claim and, when known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim and, if
known, the notice shall specify the amount or an estimate of the amount of the
liability arising therefrom. The Indemnified Party shall provide to the
Indemnifying Party copies of all material notices and documents (including
court papers) received or transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to
such claim. The failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to deliver prompt
written notice of a claim shall not affect the indemnity obligations of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was
actually disadvantaged by such failure or delay in delivery of notice of such
claim.

(b) Settlement of Losses. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of
any claim by a third party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder pursuant
to Section 11.06(d), the Indemnified Party shall not settle, consent to the
entry of a judgment of or compromise such claim without the prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Indemnifying Party.

11.06 Rights of Indemnifying Party in the Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) Right to Assume the Defense. In connection with any claim by a third party
which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such
claim by the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of any such claim, which
defense shall be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or
settlement in accordance with the terms hereof. 

(b) Procedure. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim and (ii) take
all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and
expense. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such claim, with its own counsel and at its sole
cost and expense; provided that, if the claim includes allegations for which
the Indemnifying Party both would and would not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall in
that case jointly assume the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate with each other and their respective
counsel in the defense or settlement of such claim. The Party in charge of the
defense shall keep the other Party appraised at all times as to the status of
the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.

(c) Settlement of Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Decline to Assume the Defense. The Indemnified Party may defend against
any such claim, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in
such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, including settling such
claim in accordance with the terms hereof if (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such claim resulting therefrom within thirty
(30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such claim by
the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that
the Indemnifying Party is (a) not diligently defending the Indemnified Person,
(b) not contesting such claim in good faith through appropriate proceedings or
(c) has not taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or
other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a Lien
against or attachment of any asset or property of the Indemnified Party for
payment of such claim.

11.07 Direct Claims. In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim
against any Indemnifying Party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder that
does not involve a claim brought by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and the facts constituting
the basis for such claim and, if known, the amount or an estimate of the
amount of the liability arising therefrom. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from receipt of such
claim notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of
such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder; however if the Indemnifying Party does notify the Indemnified Party
that it disputes such claim within the require thirty (30) day period, the
Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
Parties with respect to such claim. If the Parties should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
Parties. If such Parties shall not agree, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to take any action in law or in equity as such Indemnified Party
shall deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this Article 11 against the
Indemnifying Party.

11.08 Exclusive Remedy. Absent fraud or willful breach, the indemnities set
forth in this Article 11 shall be the exclusive remedies of Purchaser and
Seller and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents
and Affiliates due to misrepresentation, breach of warranty, 

nonfulfillment or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, and the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature
whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive.

11.09 Indemnity Treatment. Any amount of indemnification payable pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 11 shall to the extent possible, be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.



11.10 Mitigation.

(a) Each of the Parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder.

(b) Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification
claim pursuant to this Article 11, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated,
to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may
have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnification claim and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such
rights to the Indemnifying Party.

11.11 No Solicitation. Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit
Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo, the Subsidiaries, any of its or their
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding
an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments (whether or
not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and shall cause Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo,
the Subsidiaries, any of its and their Affiliates and all of its and their
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof,
"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person concerning (a) a merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization,
share exchange or other business combination transaction involving Laredo
HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo or any Subsidiary; (b) the issuance or acquisition of
equity securities of Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo or any Subsidiary; or (c)
the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of
Laredo HoldCo, Tapestry HoldCo's or any Subsidiary's properties or assets.

property interest by NRG Energy, Inc., the undersigned hereby certifies:



1. NRG Energy, Inc. is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder);



2. NRG Energy, Inc. is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

Internal Revenue Service by NRG Yield Operating LLC and that any false
statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

EXHIBIT I

SELLER PARENT GUARANTY



NRG ENERGY, INC.



THIS GUARANTY ("Guaranty"), effective as of November 4, 2014, by NRG Energy,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Guarantor"), is to and for the benefit of NRG
Yield Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer") and the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (collectively, "Beneficiary"). Capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given such terms in the
Contract (as such term is defined below).



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, NRG Wind LLC ("Obligor") and Buyer have of even date herewith entered
into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (as such agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Contract") for the
sale by Obligor to Buyer of the Acquired Interests;



WHEREAS, Obligor is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Guarantor; and

WHEREAS, Section 5.07 of the Contract requires that this Guaranty be executed
and delivered by Guarantor concurrently with the execution of the Contract;

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration and as an inducement to Buyer to
enter into the Contract, Guarantor covenants with Obligor as follows:

1.Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees to Beneficiary the full and
timely performance when due, the payment of all amounts when due and owing,
and observance when due of all covenants, terms and agreements to be
performed, paid or observed, as applicable, by Obligor under the Contract, all
whether presently existing or from time to time hereafter created, incurred or
arising (collectively, the "Obligations"). Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall not modify or
expand the Obligations under the Contract (which Obligations shall be limited
as expressly set forth in the Contract). This Guaranty is a continuing
guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

2.Guarantor covenants to Buyer that if at any time Obligor defaults in the
payment or performance when due of any of its Obligations, Guarantor shall,
promptly upon written notice by Beneficiary (provided that no notice is
required in case of an automatic stay), pay or perform, or cause the payment
or performance of, such Obligations.

3.It is expressly understood and agreed by Guarantor that, to the extent
Guarantor's obligations hereunder relate to Obligations which require
performance other than the payment of money, Beneficiary may proceed against
Guarantor to effect specific performance thereof (to the extent such relief is
available) or for payment of damages (as limited by the Contract) resulting
from Obligor's nonperformance. Subject to the provisions of Section 16 hereof,
Guarantor hereby covenants to perform or cause to be performed all of the
obligations, terms and conditions on the 

part of Obligor to be performed under the Contract for the balance of the term
thereof. Should the Contract be disaffirmed by the trustee in bankruptcy for
Obligor, then (without limiting the provisions of Section 6(h)) at the option
of Buyer, and subject to the provisions of Section 16 hereof, Guarantor shall
make and enter into a new agreement to perform or cause to be performed the
balance of the Obligations, which new agreement shall be in form and substance
identical to the Contract.

4.All payments by Guarantor to Beneficiary shall be made in the United States
in United States Dollars and shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
receipt by Guarantor from Buyer of written demand for such payment (except in
those circumstances where giving such demand is prevented by an automatic
stay) and shall not be the subject of any offset against any amounts which may
be owed by Beneficiary to Guarantor for any reason unrelated to the Contract.
Each and every default or failure by Obligor in making a payment or otherwise
discharging or performing any of the Obligations shall give rise to a separate
liability of such Obligor to Beneficiary and a separate cause of action
hereunder and a separate suit may be brought hereunder as each liability or
cause of action arises.

5.Guarantor agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees, including all
reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be incurred by Beneficiary in enforcing
this Guaranty, whether by suit or otherwise, but only to the extent payment or
performance under this Guaranty is otherwise due and Beneficiary is the
prevailing party in its claim against Guarantor.

6.The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable,
absolute and unconditional, except to the extent that Obligor's payment or
performance would be excused by Beneficiary's failure to fulfill its
obligations under the Contract, and shall remain in full force and effect
until such time as set forth in Section 16 hereof. The obligations of
Guarantor shall not be affected, modified or impaired or prejudiced (i) by any
other security now or hereafter held by Beneficiary as security for the
obligations of the Obligor under the Contract; or (ii) upon the happening from
time to time of any one or more of the following whether or not with notice to
or consent of Obligor (except to the extent that Obligor's consent may be
required to effectuate a modification of the Contract) or Guarantor:

(a)the taking of any action by Beneficiary to enforce any Obligation or the
Contract against Obligor;

(b)the compromise, settlement, release, change, modification, rescission or
termination of any of the Obligations;

(c)the waiver by Beneficiary of the payment, performance or observance of any
of Obligations;

(d)the extension of time for payment of any amounts due or of the time for
performance of any of the Obligations;

(e)the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any of the
Obligations; 

(f)the failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of Beneficiary to enforce,
ascertain or exercise any right, power or remedy under or pursuant to the
terms of the Contracts or this Guaranty;

(g)the fact that Guarantor may at any time in the future dispose of all or any
part of its interest in Obligor, or otherwise alter its investment in Obligor
in any manner;

(h)the bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up, dissolution, liquidation,
administration, reorganization or other similar or dissimilar failure or
financial disability of Obligor, or any legal limitation, disability,
incapacity or other circumstances relating to Obligor;

(i)the addition or substitution of any guarantor, maker or other third party
primarily or secondarily liable or responsible for the performance or
observance of any of the Obligations or by any extension, waiver, amendment or
thing whatsoever which may release or discharge (in whole or in part) any such
guarantor, maker or other third party (other than as a result of the
indefeasible payment and performance of the Obligations in full);

(j)the invalidity, nonbinding effect or unenforceability of (x) the
Obligations or (y) the Contract in its entirety; or

(k)the taking, variation, renewal, addition, substitution, subordination, or
partial or entire release of any security for the Obligations or the
enforcement or neglect to perfect or enforce any such security.

7.Guarantor irrevocably and absolutely waives any and all right of
subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement or similar rights
against Obligor with respect to the Guaranty, whether such rights arise under
an express or implied contract or by operation of law, it being the intention
of Guarantor and Buyer that Guarantor shall not be deemed to be a "creditor"
(as defined in Section 101 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable
law) of Obligor by reason of the existence of this Guaranty in the event that
Obligor becomes a debtor in any proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
any other applicable law. In addition, Guarantor will not exercise any rights
which it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty by any payment
made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the Obligations shall have
indefeasibly been paid or performed in full. If any amount shall be paid to
Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all the
Obligations shall not have been indefeasibly paid or performed in full, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Beneficiary and shall
forthwith be paid to Beneficiary and applied to such liabilities and
obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

8.Beneficiary shall have the right, in its sole judgment and discretion, from
time to time, to make demand for payment or performance and to proceed against
Guarantor for recovery of the total of any and all amounts due, or for the
performance of any nonmonetary obligation owed, to Beneficiary pursuant to
this Guaranty, or to proceed from time to time against Guarantor for such
portion of any and all such amounts, or for the performance of any and all
such nonmonetary obligations, as Beneficiary may determine. 

9.So long as any Obligations are owed to Beneficiary, Guarantor shall not,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, commence or join with any other
Person in commencing, any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding
against Obligor. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be
altered, limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary,
involving the winding up, dissolution, administration, bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement or
similar proceeding of Obligor, or by any defense which Obligor may have by
reason of any order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body
resulting from any such proceeding.

10.With respect to all Obligations, this is a guarantee of payment and
performance and not of collection, and Guarantor hereby waives and
relinquishes all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or
guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or
remedies, including without limitation:

(a) any right to require Beneficiary to proceed against Obligor or any other
person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Beneficiary at
any time or to pursue any other remedy in Beneficiary's power before
proceeding against Guarantor;

(b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority,
death or disability of any other person or the failure of Beneficiary to file
or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any
other proceeding) of any other person;

(c) any demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind except as
otherwise required under this Guaranty, including without limitation (i)
notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional
Obligations, (ii) notice of any breach or default by Obligor under the
Contract or of any action or non-action on the part of Beneficiary, Obligor,
any creditor of Obligor or Guarantor or on the part of any other person under
this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of
indebtedness held by Beneficiary as collateral or in connection with any
Obligations hereby guaranteed;

(d) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Beneficiary which
destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Guarantor, the right
of Guarantor to proceed against Obligor for reimbursement, or both;

(e) any duty on the part of Beneficiary to disclose to Guarantor any facts
Beneficiary may now or hereafter know about Obligor, regardless of whether
Beneficiary has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the
risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to assume, or has reason to believe
that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or has a reasonable opportunity to
communicate such facts to Guarantor, since Guarantor acknowledges that
Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial
condition of Obligor and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-
payment of any Obligations hereby guaranteed; and

(f) any defense arising because of the exercise of any right or remedy
available to, or election made by, Beneficiary pursuant to the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, whether as an unsecured or undersecured creditor, seeking
adequate protection, or otherwise. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10 to the contrary,
Guarantor hereby reserves to itself all rights to which Obligor is or may be
entitled arising from or in connection with each of the Contract and the
Obligations, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor or the incapacity or lack of authority
of Obligor to enter into or perform its obligations under the Contract, and
all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors
based on the defense of the statute of limitations related to the
enforceability of this Guaranty in any action hereunder or in any action for
the payment or performance of any Obligations hereby guaranteed.

11.This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that
Guarantor may not make an assignment or other transfer of this Guaranty or any
interest herein by operation of law or otherwise unless it has obtained the
prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall be solely within Buyer's
discretion) to such assignment or other transfer. Buyer may collaterally
assign its rights under this Guaranty to any Lender.

12.All notices to Guarantor required to be served under this Guaranty shall be
in writing and shall be served by registered mail and shall be addressed as
follows:

State of New York and the United States of America. All agreements,
instruments and notices referred to herein or supplementary hereto shall be
prepared, furnished in, and governed, and controlled by the English language.

may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the State of New 

York by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact and the amount of such judgment. Any
finding of fact by, and any interim or final award or judgment made by an
arbitrator, a court or tribunal with jurisdiction over a claim (in either
case, brought pursuant to Section 13.10 of the Contract) under the Contract
shall be binding on Guarantor to the same extent that it is binding on Seller
for the purposes of this Guaranty.

14.Guarantor represents, covenants and agrees to and with Buyer that:

(a)Guarantor (i) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) is duly
qualified, authorized to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary;

(b)the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and its performance have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Guarantor;

(c)this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by Guarantor and is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to the application of bankruptcy and
similar laws and of general equitable principles;

(d)the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty will not (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of Guarantor's Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) conflict with or violate any law or (iii)
conflict with, violate or constitute a default under, any provision of any
security issued by Guarantor or of any agreement, instrument or undertaking to
which Guarantor is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration thereunder
with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both), and do not
require any license, consent or approval of any governmental authority;

(e)except as disclosed in Guarantor's public filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before
any arbitrator or governmental authority or order is pending or, to
Guarantor's knowledge, threatened by or against Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries or against any of such parties' properties or revenues which, if
adversely determined, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the ability on Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder;

(f)Guarantor is not a party to, nor has it received, written notice of any
pending or, to the knowledge of Guarantor, threatened material action against
Guarantor that would prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge the
execution, delivery or performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty or the
validity or enforceability hereof; and

(g)it has established adequate means of obtaining financial and other
information pertaining to the business, operations and condition (financial or
otherwise) of Obligor and its respective properties on a continuing basis, and
Guarantor is and hereafter will be completely familiar with the business,
operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of Obligor and its
respective properties. 

15.Guarantor agrees that:

(a) It will maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental
or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this
Guaranty and will obtain any that may become necessary in the future for the
payment and performance of the Obligations;

(b) It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and
orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially
impair its ability to perform the Obligations;

(c) Guarantor will, or will cause Obligor to, deliver to Buyer from time to
time, such other reasonable information or documents regarding Guarantor
relating to any event that may materially or adversely affect Guarantor's
ability to perform the Obligations as Buyer may reasonably request and as may
be available to Guarantor without undue cost or effort; provided, however,
that Guarantor may impose reasonable confidentiality requirements in
connection with the disclosure of such information or documents.

16.Termination; Reinstatement of Guaranty.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 16(b), this Guaranty shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the full satisfaction of all Obligations of
Obligor arising under the Contract (and such satisfaction is not disputed in
good faith by Buyer) and the period for making claims set forth in Section
10.2 of the Contract has expired; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything in the Contract to the contrary, for purposes of this Guaranty such
period shall be deemed to expire as of the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
effective date of the Contract, and (ii) the termination of the Contract
(other than a termination by Buyer as a result of a breach of the Contract by
Obligor); provided, however, that Guarantor's liability hereunder shall
survive any such termination with respect to any claims made by Beneficiary
hereunder with respect to matters arising prior to such termination.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16(a), this Guaranty shall be
reinstated if at any time following the termination of this Guaranty under
Section 16(a), any payment by Guarantor or Obligor of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Beneficiary upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor, all as
though such payment had not been made. Such period of reinstatement shall
continue until satisfaction of the conditions contained in, and shall continue
to be subject to, the provisions of this Section 16.

(c) Subject to Section 16(a), this Guaranty shall remain in effect
notwithstanding any assignment of the Contract by Obligor to any affiliate or
subsidiary of such Obligor or Guarantor permitted under the terms of the
Contract. Upon request by Buyer after any such assignment, Guarantor shall
acknowledge the continuing effectiveness of this Guaranty notwithstanding such
assignment. 

17.Any invalid or unenforceable provisions in this Guaranty shall be deemed
severed herefrom, and such whole or partial invalidity shall not affect the
enforceability or validity of the balance of this Guaranty.

18.No failure on the part of Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by Beneficiary of any right,
remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right,
remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to
Beneficiary or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Beneficiary at any time or
from time to time.

19.This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

20.This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between Guarantor and
Beneficiary with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Guaranty
nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived
or modified orally, except by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which the enforcement of this termination, amendment, supplement,
waiver or modification shall be sought.
