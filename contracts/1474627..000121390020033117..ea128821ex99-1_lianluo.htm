(b) The Parties shall take all action necessary (including, to the extent
necessary, procuring the resignation or removal of any directors on the Board
of Directors of LLIT (the " _LLIT Board_ ") immediately prior to the
Effective Time) so that, as of the Effective Time, the LLIT Board shall be

Section 1.6 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of LLIT, Newegg, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of LLIT, Newegg or Merger Sub, other than as
contemplated in this Agreement, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (and the shares of the Surviving Corporation into which
the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock are so converted shall be the only
shares of the Surviving Corporation's capital stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time), so that
immediately following the Effective Time, LLIT will be the holder of all the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) or Excluded Shares (as hereinafter

issued and outstanding on the date hereof, after giving effect to such reverse
stock split.

be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, split-up,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Newegg Shares, LLIT Class A Shares or LLIT Class B Shares,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to the Newegg Shares, LLIT Class A Shares or LLIT Class B Shares
having a record date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time; provided, that nothing in this subsection (i)
shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(i) If  _Section 1.6(b)_ would result in the issuance of any fractional LLIT
Exchange Shares, then, notwithstanding _Section 1.6(b)_ , such fractional
LLIT Exchange Share shall not be issued by LLIT and in lieu thereof, LLIT
shall pay in cash, without interest, an amount equal to the amount of such
fractional LLIT Exchange Share times the LLIT 20 Day VWAP (the " _Cash
Payment_ ").

  



  

(ii) All Newegg Shares, when so exchanged and converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Newegg Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to Newegg Shares, and thereafter such certificates shall
represent the LLIT Exchange Shares into which such Newegg Shares are
converted.

  



  

(c) Each Newegg Share held by Newegg as treasury stock or owned by LLIT,
Merger Sub or by any wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Newegg
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired without payment or consideration therefor.

  



  

(d) All options, warrants and other securities convertible into or
exercisable for shares of Newegg capital stock shall either be converted or
exercised into Newegg Shares prior to the Effective Time (and holders thereof
shall receive part of the Merger Consideration) or be assumed by LLIT pursuant
to _Section 1.9_.

  



  

(e) At the Effective Time, each LLIT Class A Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding.
Immediately following the Effective Time, any LLIT Class A Shares owned by
the Surviving Corporation shall automatically be cancelled and
retired without payment or consideration therefor.

  



  

(f) Through the Support Agreement, Hangzhou Lianluo has agreed (i) to convert
each LLIT Class B Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time into a LLIT Class A Share pursuant to the terms of the Amended
Charter, and (ii) that the warrant contained in Section 4(j) of the Share
Purchase Agreement dated as of April 28, 2016 by and among LLIT and Hangzhou
Lianluo shall be a warrant to acquire from LLIT 125,000 LLIT Class A Shares
at a purchase price of $17.60 per share (after giving effect to LLIT's 1 for 8
reverse stock split), with the number of shares and exercise price both
subject to appropriate adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock
dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of LLIT Shares
that occur after the date hereof. Subject to the foregoing, immediately
following the Effective Time, any LLIT Class B Shares, and any options,
warrants or other securities which are convertible or exchangeable into LLIT
Class B Shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired without payment
or consideration therefor.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, LLIT shall designate
for exchange, in accordance with this _Section 1.7_ ,

Time, LLIT shall cause its transfer agent to deliver the appropriate Merger
Consideration and enter in LLIT's register of members the names of the
holders of record of Newegg Shares in exchange for all Newegg Shares that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether

form and have such provisions as LLIT and Newegg mutually and reasonably
specify); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange and
cancellation to LLIT or to such agents as may be appointed by LLIT, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and any other documents as
may be reasonably required, the holder of such Newegg Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the LLIT Exchange Shares together with the
Cash Payment, if applicable, to which such holder is entitled to under
_Section 1.6(b)_ , and the Newegg Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7_, (x) each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
LLIT Exchange Shares as contemplated by _Section 1.6(b)_ and (y) a holder
of Newegg Shares shall not receive any dividends or distributions in
respect of any such corresponding LLIT Exchange Shares which they may
otherwise be entitled to; _provided_ that once the Newegg Shares are

dividends or distributions with a record date after the Closing Date and
payable with respect to such LLIT Exchange Shares, if any, they are entitled
to receive.

destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
LLIT in its reasonable business judgment, the execution of an indemnity
agreement against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, LLIT will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the LLIT Exchange Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_.

  



  

(d) _Form F-4_. LLIT shall issue the LLIT Exchange Shares in exchange for
outstanding Newegg Shares as provided in _Section 1.6_ pursuant to the
Merger Registration Statement on the Form F-4 filed under the Securities Act.
LLIT and Newegg shall comply with all applicable provisions of, and rules
under, the Securities Act in connection with the offering and issuance of the
Merger Consideration, including the inclusion of the necessary financial
statements related to their respective businesses.

the Surviving Corporation or LLIT, such Certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

  



  

Section 1.9 _Assumption of Newegg Benefit Plans and Awards_.

acquire or vest in, each Newegg Share (the " _Awards_ ") issued under the
Newegg Benefit Plans or granted by Newegg outside of its Benefit Plans that is
outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each of the Awards shall be converted into a
stock option to purchase or a right to acquire or vest in, respectively, such
number of LLIT Class A Shares equal to the LLIT Conversion Ratio, and, for
stock options, the exercise price per LLIT Class A Share shall equal the
exercise price per Newegg Share in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time for the Award divided by the LLIT Conversion Ratio, _provided that_
 such exercise price per share for the applicable LLIT Shares will be at
least the per share par value of such LLIT Class A Shares and _provided
further_ that any Awards made during the Interim Period (as hereinafter
defined) shall have an exercise price at least equal to the closing price of
the LLIT Class A Shares on the date of grant times the LLIT Conversion Ratio.
If the aforementioned conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction
of a LLIT Class A Share, in lieu of issuing such fraction of a LLIT Class A
Share, LLIT shall pay to the holder of the Award an amount in cash equal to
the LLIT 20 Day VWAP times the amount of such fraction. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Newegg Benefit Plans_ " shall mean, collectively, the Benefit
Plans listed on  _Schedule 4.19_ of the Newegg Disclosure Schedules (as
hereinafter defined) and any and all subplans, appendices or
addendums thereto, and any and all agreements evidencing Awards.

business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (b) not been subject to a Material Adverse Effect and (c) has not
taken any action or committed or agreed to take any action that would be
prohibited by _Section 5.2(b)_ if such action were taken on or after the

material respects its business as presently conducted and as currently
contemplated to be conducted, and to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties (collectively, the " _Newegg Permits_"). Newegg has made
available to LLIT true, correct and complete copies of all material Newegg
Permits. All of Newegg Permits are in full force and effect, and no
suspension or cancellation of any of Newegg Permits is pending or, to Newegg's
Knowledge, threatened, except where the failure to hold such Permit or for

or registered or in which an application for issuance or registration has
been filed and (D) the issuance, registration or application numbers and
dates; and (ii) all material unregistered Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by a Newegg Subsidiary. _Schedule 4.13(a)(ii)_ sets

_Newegg IP Licenses_ ") (other than "shrink wrap," "click wrap," and "off the
shelf" software agreements and other agreements for Software commercially
available on reasonable terms to the public generally with license,
maintenance, support and other fees of less than $5,000 per year
(collectively, " _Off-the-Shelf Software Agreements_ "), which are not
required to be listed, although such licenses are "Newegg IP Licenses" as
that term is used herein), under which a Newegg Subsidiary is a licensee or
otherwise is authorized to use or practice any Intellectual Property, and
describes (A) the applicable Intellectual Property licensed, sublicensed or
used and (B) any royalties, license fees or other compensation due from a
Newegg Subsidiary, if any. Each Newegg Subsidiary owns, free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens), has valid and enforceable rights in, and
has the unrestricted right to use, sell, license, transfer or assign, all
Intellectual Property currently used, licensed or held for use by such Newegg
Subsidiary, and previously used or licensed by such Newegg Subsidiary, except
for the Intellectual Property that is the subject of Newegg IP Licenses. For
each Patent and Patent application in Newegg Registered IP, the Newegg
Subsidiaries have obtained valid assignments of inventions from each
inventor. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13(a)(iii)_ , all Newegg
Registered IP is owned exclusively by the applicable Newegg Subsidiary
without obligation to pay royalties, licensing fees or other fees, or
otherwise account to any third party with respect to such Newegg Registered
IP.

  



  

(b) Each Newegg Subsidiary has a valid and enforceable license to use all
Intellectual Property that is the subject of Newegg IP Licenses applicable to
such Newegg Subsidiary. Newegg IP Licenses include all of the licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements or permissions necessary to operate the
Newegg Subsidiaries as presently conducted. Each Newegg Subsidiary has
performed all obligations imposed on it in Newegg IP Licenses, has made
all payments required to date, and such Newegg Subsidiary is not, nor, to the
Knowledge of Newegg, is any other party thereto, in breach or default
thereunder, nor has any event occurred that with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default thereunder, except that any breach or default
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Newegg.
The continued use by the Newegg Subsidiaries of the Intellectual Property
that is the subject of Newegg IP Licenses in the same manner that it is
currently being used is not restricted by any applicable license of any Newegg
Subsidiary. All registrations for Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks that are
owned by or exclusively licensed to any Newegg Subsidiary are valid and in
force, and all applications to register any Copyrights, Patents and
Trademarks are pending and in good standing, all without challenge of any
kind. No Newegg Subsidiary is party to any Contract that requires a Newegg
Subsidiary to assign to any Person all of its rights in any
Intellectual Property developed by a Newegg Subsidiary under such Contract.

licensee under such Outbound IP License, and (iii) any royalties, license fees
or other compensation due to a Newegg Subsidiary, if any. Each Newegg
Subsidiary has performed all obligations imposed on it in the Outbound IP
Licenses, and such Newegg Subsidiary is not, nor, to the Knowledge of Newegg,
is any other party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor has any
event occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default thereunder, except that any breach or default would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Newegg.

  



  

(d)  No Action is pending or, to Newegg's Knowledge, threatened that
challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or right to use, sell,
license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently licensed, used or
held for use by the Newegg Subsidiaries in any material respect. No Newegg
Subsidiary has received any written or, to the Knowledge of Newegg, oral
notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use of the Intellectual
Property of any other Person is or may be occurring or has or may have
occurred, as a consequence of the business activities of any
Newegg Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of Newegg is there a reasonable basis
therefor. There are no Orders to which any Newegg Subsidiary is a party or
its otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of a Newegg Subsidiary to
use, transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned by a Newegg
Subsidiary, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of a Newegg Subsidiary
in order to accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property, or (iii)
grant any third Person any right with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by a Newegg Subsidiary. No Newegg Subsidiary is currently infringing, or
has, in the past, infringed, misappropriated or violated any Intellectual
Property of any other Person in any material respect in connection with the
ownership, use or license of any Intellectual Property owned or purported to
be owned by a Newegg Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Newegg, otherwise
in connection with the conduct of the respective businesses of the Newegg
Subsidiaries. To Newegg's Knowledge, no third party is infringing upon, has
misappropriated or is otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned,
licensed by, licensed to, or otherwise used or held for use by any Newegg
Subsidiary (" _Newegg IP_ ") in any material respect.

(e)  All employees and independent contractors of a Newegg Subsidiary have
assigned to the Newegg Subsidiaries all Intellectual Property arising from
the services performed for a Newegg Subsidiary by such Persons. No current or
former officers, employees or independent contractors of a Newegg Subsidiary
have claimed any ownership interest in any Intellectual Property owned by a
Newegg Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Newegg, there has been no violation of
a Newegg Subsidiary's policies or practices related to protection of Newegg
Intellectual Property or any confidentiality or nondisclosure Contract
relating to the Intellectual Property owned by a Newegg Subsidiary, except
for any violation that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Newegg. Newegg has provided LLIT with true and complete
copies of all written Contracts referenced in subsections under which
employees and independent contractors assigned their Intellectual Property to
a Newegg Subsidiary.

  



  

(f) To the Knowledge of Newegg, no Person has obtained unauthorized access
to third party information and data in the possession of a Newegg Subsidiary,
nor has there been any other compromise of the security, confidentiality or
integrity of such information or data. Each Newegg Subsidiary has complied in
all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to privacy, personal
data protection, and the collection, processing and use of personal
information and its own privacy policies and guidelines. The operation of the
business of the Newegg Subsidiaries has not and does not materially violate
any right to privacy or publicity of any third person, or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under applicable Law.

  



  

(g)  The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will neither violate nor by their terms result in the material
breach, material modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of, or
acceleration of any payments with respect to, or release of source code
because of (i) any Contract providing for the license or other use of
Intellectual Property owned by a Newegg Subsidiary, or (ii) any Newegg IP
License. Following the Closing, Newegg shall be permitted to exercise,
directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries, all of the Newegg
Subsidiaries' rights under such Contracts or IP Licenses described in the
previous sentence to the same extent that the Newegg Subsidiaries would have
been able to exercise had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred, without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other
than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Newegg Subsidiaries would
otherwise be required to pay in the absence of such transactions.

Section 4.15 _Real Property_. _Schedule 4.15_ contains a complete and
accurate list of all premises currently leased or subleased or otherwise used
or occupied by a Newegg Subsidiary for the operation of the business of a
Newegg Subsidiary, and of all current leases, lease guarantees, agreements
and documents related thereto, including all amendments, terminations and

Newegg Real Property Lease, a written summary of the material terms of such
Newegg Real Property Lease. Newegg Real Property Leases are valid, binding
and enforceable in accordance with their terms and are in full force

Newegg Subsidiary or any other party under any of Newegg Real Property

trade or practice. Each such employee has entered into Newegg's standard form
of employee non-disclosure, inventions and restrictive covenants agreement

incorporation by reference in the Form F-4, LLIT shall ensure that, when
furnished, the Form F-4 will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
LLIT shall cause the Shareholder Meeting Notice to be disseminated as
promptly as practicable to LLIT's equity holders as and to the extent such
dissemination is required by U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ promulgated thereunder or otherwise (the "

all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties. In the event that any signature

shall create a valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance; Submission to Jurisdiction_. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this

hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided, that
if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of

action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve, (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. LLIT,
Newegg and Merger Sub hereby consent to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section 9.1_ and agree that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail (return receipt
requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the respective addresses set

or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Exhibit D

  

Form of Lock-Up Agreement

  



  

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of [●], 2020 by and
among Lianluo Smart Limited., a British Virgin Islands company, which will be
known after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (as defined below) as "Newegg Commerce, Inc." (including any
successor entity thereto, the " _Parent_ "), and the undersigned (" _Holder_
"). Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Agreement will have the
meaning ascribed to such term in the Merger Agreement (as defined herein
below).

  



  

WHEREAS, on [●], 2020, the Parent entered into that certain Merger Agreement
(as amended from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among (i) the Parent, (ii) Newegg, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and (iii) Lightning Delaware Sub,
Inc., Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "
_Merger Sub_ "), pursuant to which the Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and as a result of
which, among other matters, all of the issued and outstanding capital shares
of the Company, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ "), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, in exchange for the LLIT Exchange Shares,
and each outstanding Company option shall be assumed by the Parent and
automatically converted into an option exercisable into LLIT Class A Shares
(as equitably adjusted), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Closing, each Holder is a beneficial holder
of the Company's securities, in such amounts as set forth underneath Holder's
name on the signature page hereto; and

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in view of the valuable
consideration to be received by Holder thereunder, the Parent and Holder
desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which the LLIT Exchange
Shares received by Holder in the Merger (all such securities, together with
any securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such
securities or into which such securities are exchanged or converted, the _"
Restricted Securities"_) shall become subject to limitations on
disposition as set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

   

D-1

 



    



  

1\. _Lock-Up Provisions_.

  



  

(a) Holder hereby agrees not to, during the period commencing from the
Closing and, with respect to the Restricted Securities, ending on the
earliest of (x) the 180 day anniversary of the date of the Closing and (y)
the date after the Closing on which the Parent consummates a liquidation,
merger, share exchange or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third
party that results in all of the Parent's shareholders having the right to
exchange their equity holdings in the Parent for cash, securities or other
property (a " _Subsequent Transaction_ "), (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "): (i)
lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to
sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract
to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise
transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Restricted
Securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of the Restricted Securities, or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to do
any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction described in clauses (i),
(ii), or (iii) above is to be settled by delivery of Restricted Securities or
other securities, in cash or otherwise (any of the foregoing described in
clauses (i), (ii), or (iii), a " _Prohibited Transfer_ "); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not preclude Holder from engaging in any transaction
in the securities of another company in the same sector or in a similar
sector as that of the Parent. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to the
transfer of any or all of the Restricted Securities owned by Holder, (A) by
gift, will or intestate succession upon the death of Holder, (B) to any
Permitted Transferee or (C) pursuant to a court order or settlement agreement
related to the distribution of assets in connection with the dissolution of
marriage or civil union; provided, however, that in any of cases (A), (B) or
(C) it shall be a condition to such transfer that the transferee executes and
delivers to the Parent an agreement stating that the transferee is
receiving and holding the Restricted Securities subject to the provisions of
this Agreement applicable to Holder, and there shall be no further transfer
of such Restricted Securities except in accordance with this Agreement. As
used in this Agreement, the term " _Permitted Transferee_ " shall mean: (1)
the members of Holder's immediate family (for purposes of this Agreement,
"immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin), (2) any trust for the direct or
indirect benefit of Holder or the immediate family of Holder, (3) if Holder is
a trust, to the trustor or beneficiary of such trust or to the estate of a
beneficiary of such trust, (4) as a distribution to limited partners,
shareholders, members of, or owners of similar equity interests in Holder
upon the liquidation and dissolution of Holder or (5) to any affiliate of
Holder or to any investment fund or other entity controlled by Holder.

  



  

(b) Intentionally omitted.

  



  

  

(c) If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the
provisions of this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be null
and void ab initio, and the Parent shall refuse to recognize any such
purported transferee of the Restricted Securities as one of its equity
holders for any purpose. In order to enforce this _Section 1_ , the Parent
may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Restricted
Securities of Holder (and permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until the
end of the Lock-Up Period.

  



  

(d) During the Lock-Up Period, each certificate evidencing any Restricted
Securities shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend
in substantially the following form, in addition to any other applicable
legends:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS
ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF [●], 2020, BY
AND AMONG THE ISSUER OF SUCH SECURITIES (THE "PARENT") AND THE PARENT'S
SHAREHOLDER NAMED THEREIN, AS AMENDED. A COPY OF SUCH LOCK-UP AGREEMENT WILL
BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE PARENT TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN
REQUEST."

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of any doubt, Holder shall retain all of its rights as
a shareholder of the Parent during the Lock-Up Period, including the right to
vote any Restricted Securities.

  



  

   

D-2

 



    



  

(f) To the extent that any of the Merger Consideration Shares held by any
other Company Stockholder subject to a Lock-Up Agreement entered into
in connection with the Closing are released from, or not subject to, lockup
restrictions substantially similar to those in this Agreement (a " _Lock-up
Change_ "), the Parent shall promptly give Holder written notice of such Lock-
up Change and the Restricted Securities subject to the terms of this
Agreement shall be immediately released from, or not subject to, the
lockup restrictions in this Agreement with an effectiveness concurrent with,
and to substantially the same extent and effect as, the Lock-up Change.

  



  

2\. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Termination of Merger Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the event that the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, this Agreement
and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically
terminate and be of no further force or effect.

  



  

(b) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement and all
obligations of Holder are personal to Holder and may not be transferred or
delegated by Holder at any time. The Parent may freely assign any or all of
its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any successor entity
(whether by merger, consolidation, equity sale, asset sale or
otherwise) without obtaining the consent or approval of Holder.

  



  

(c) _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any instrument
or document executed by any party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have been
executed for the benefit of, any person or entity that is not a party hereto
or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a party.

  



  

(d) _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
California without reference to its conflict of law provisions. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of any state or federal court located in Los Angeles County, California (or in
any court in which appeal from such courts may be taken) in connection with
any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California for such Persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.

  



  

(e) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 2(e)_.

  



   

D-3

 



    



  

(f) _Interpretation_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are for
convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires: (i) any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa; (ii)
"including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including without
limiting the generality of any description preceding or succeeding such term
and shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation"; (iii) the words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words
of similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or other
subdivision of this Agreement; and (iv) the term "or" means "and/or". The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Notices_. Any notice, consent or request to be given in connection with
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be completed in
accordance with Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

  

(h) _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term of this Agreement may be amended and
the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance, and either retroactively or prospectively) only
with the written consent of the Parent and Holder. No failure or delay by a
party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No
waivers of or exceptions to any term, condition, or provision of this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as
a further or continuing waiver of any such term, condition, or provision.

  



  

(i) _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

(j) _Specific Performance_. Holder acknowledges that its obligations under
this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by Holder, money damages may be inadequate and the
Parent may have not adequate remedy at law, and agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by Holder in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parent shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
Holder and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
without the requirement to post any bond or other security or to prove that
money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to any other right
or remedy to which such party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or
in equity.

  



  

(k) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject
matter hereof existing between the parties is expressly canceled; _provided_
, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not affect the rights
and obligations of the parties under the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, including the Amended and Restated Registration Rights
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit any of the rights or remedies of the Parent or any of the obligations
of Holder under any other agreement between Holder and the Parent or any
certificate or instrument executed by Holder in favor of the Parent, and
nothing in any other agreement, certificate or instrument shall limit any of
the rights or remedies of the Parent or any of the obligations of Holder
under this Agreement.

  



  

(l) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at another party's request and
without further consideration (but at the requesting party's reasonable cost
and expense), each party shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(m) _Counterparts; Facsimile._ This Agreement may also be executed and
delivered by facsimile signature or by email in portable document format in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
