to use, sell, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently licensed, used or held for use by the Newegg Subsidiaries

any other Person is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred, as a consequence of the business activities of any Newegg
Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of Newegg is there a reasonable basis therefor. There are no Orders to which any Newegg Subsidiary

Intellectual Property owned by a Newegg Subsidiary, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of a Newegg Subsidiary in order to
accommodate a third Person&rsquo;s Intellectual Property, or (iii) grant any third Person any right with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by a Newegg Subsidiary. No Newegg Subsidiary is currently infringing, or has, in the past, infringed, misappropriated
or violated any Intellectual Property of any other Person in any material respect in connection with the ownership, use or license
of any Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by a Newegg Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Newegg, otherwise in
connection with the conduct of the respective businesses of the Newegg Subsidiaries. To Newegg&rsquo;s Knowledge, no third party
is infringing upon, has misappropriated or is otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned, licensed by, licensed to, or
otherwise used or held for use by any Newegg Subsidiary (&ldquo;<U>Newegg IP</U>&rdquo;) in any material respect.</P>

In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall

and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
nor shall the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties will substitute for any invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.</P>

Holder acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach
of this Agreement by Holder, money damages may be inadequate and the Parent may have not adequate remedy at law, and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by Holder in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parent shall be entitled to seek an injunction or restraining
order to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Holder and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
the requirement to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to
any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.</P>

in favor of the Parent, and nothing in any other agreement, certificate or instrument shall limit any of the rights or remedies
