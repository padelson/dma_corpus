deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable hereunder to any Person such
consideration as it is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of any Law respecting

Merger Consideration, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and for making payments of the
Merger Consideration to the Equityholders except for the payments of cash to the holders of Vested
Company Options which shall be made by the Surviving Company in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.2(b). As
soon as reasonably practicable after the First Merger Effective Time, the Buyer will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to the extent not already sent by the Company prior to Closing, to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Warrants, as of the
First Merger Effective Time, whose shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and

applicable, a properly completed and duly executed Surrender Agreement, and such other documents as

in lieu of fractional shares) and/or shares of Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock representing, in the
aggregate, the portion and type of the Exchange Fund that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;III (less any required Tax withholding). Such cash
and/or shares shall be paid as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two Business Days)
after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificates and letter of transmittal in accordance
with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any consideration from the Exchange
Fund. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the First Merger Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such portion and type of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by Sections&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If any shares issuable under this Article&nbsp;III are to be registered in the name of a Person
other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the shares issuable
hereunder shall pay to the Exchange Agent any required transfer or other similar Taxes or establish

prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Buyer for delivery of the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder&#146;s shares of Company Common Stock, shares of

the Surviving Company nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants for any consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with this Agreement remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer free

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Closing Statement</U>. Included on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet are
estimates of the (i)&nbsp;Net Closing Cash, (ii)&nbsp;Transaction Expenses, (iii)&nbsp;Net Working Capital, and
(iv)&nbsp;the Adjustment Amount (such item (iv), the &#147;<U>Estimated Adjustment Amount</U>&#148;). Within 90
days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative and JMI
a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing and a certificate executed by an executive officer
of the Buyer (the &#147;<U>Closing Statement</U>&#148;) setting forth the Buyer&#146;s determination of the
actual (i)&nbsp;Net Closing Cash, (ii)&nbsp;Transaction Expenses, (iii)&nbsp;Net Working Capital, and (iv)&nbsp;the
Adjustment Amount, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Company&#146;s
past practices (to the extent such past practices were in accordance with GAAP). Following
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Representative and JMI with trial
balances and supporting schedules relevant to such determinations prepared by Buyer or its
accountants. Buyer shall also provide the Representative and its accountants with timely access,
during the Buyer&#146;s normal business hours, to the personnel, properties, books and records of Buyer,
Merger Sub (Corp), Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;and the Surviving Company as may be reasonably requested by the
Representative to the extent related to the determination of the items set forth on the Closing
Statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Dispute Resolution</U>. Within 30&nbsp;days after the Representative&#146;s receipt of the
Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a written statement either
accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any objections thereto in reasonable detail (an
&#147;<U>Objections Statement</U>&#148;). If the Representative accepts the Closing Statement or does not
deliver an Objections Statement within such 30-day period, then the Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon all parties. If the Representative does deliver an Objections Statement
within such 30-day period, then the Representative and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for
15&nbsp;days following the Buyer&#146;s receipt of such Objections Statement to resolve such objections (any
unresolved objection, a &#147;<U>Dispute</U>&#148;). After such 15-day period, any item or matter set forth
in the Closing Statement that is not a Dispute shall become final and binding upon all parties. If
the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve all Disputes during such 15-day period, then
any remaining Disputes, and only such remaining Disputes, shall be resolved by Ernst & Young LLP
or, if Ernst & Young LLP is not available for such assignment, such other nationally or regionally
recognized accounting firm upon which the Buyer and the Representative shall reasonably agree (the
&#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining
Disputes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30&nbsp;days after its appointment. The
resolution of such Disputes by the Accounting Firm (i)&nbsp;shall be set forth in writing, (ii)&nbsp;shall be
within the range of dispute between the Buyer and the Representative, (iii)&nbsp;shall constitute an
arbitral award, and (iv)&nbsp;shall be conclusive and binding upon all the parties upon which a judgment
may be rendered by a court having proper jurisdiction thereover. Upon delivery of such resolution,
the Closing Statement, as modified in accordance with such resolution, shall become final and
binding upon all parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Fees and Expenses of Accounting Firm</U>. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Buyer if the Buyer is the non-prevailing party or
solely by the Equityholders if the Representative is the non-prevailing party. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the &#147;non-prevailing party&#148; shall be the party whose proposed calculation of the
Adjustment Amount submitted to the Accounting Firm was further from the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount as finally determined. If the Equityholders are required to bear the fees, costs
and expenses of the Accounting Firm, such fees, costs and expenses shall be satisfied through the
payment of such fees, costs and expenses by the Buyer and a deduction of the amount thereof from
the Escrow Cash Amount. In such event the Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to release such amount from the Escrow Cash Amount to the Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Final Adjustment Amount</U>. As used herein, &#147;<U>Final Adjustment Amount</U>&#148; means
(i)&nbsp;if the Representative accepts the Closing Statement in writing or fails to deliver an
Objections Statement within the time period specified in Section&nbsp;3.5(b), the Adjustment Amount as
set forth in the Closing Statement, or (ii)&nbsp;if the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Closing
Statement is resolved by resolution of the Buyer and the Representative or by submission of any
remaining Disputes to the Accounting Firm, as contemplated by Section&nbsp;3.5(b), the Adjustment Amount
as so resolved. If the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
then the Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days following the
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) deliver cash in the amount of such difference to the
Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Equityholders other than JMI (based on their respective Pro
Rata Portions). If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then
the Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver from the Escrow Cash
Amount an amount in cash from the Escrow Fund equal to such difference. All consideration payable
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.5 shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the
consideration payable by the Buyer under Article&nbsp;III.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Effect on Dissenting Shares</U>. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by a holder who has
demanded and perfected such demand for appraisal of such holder&#146;s shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL and as of the Closing has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holder&#146;s right to such appraisal (the &#147;<U>Dissenting
Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be converted into the right to receive any portion of the consideration
payable in accordance with Article&nbsp;III, but shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
the DGCL. The Buyer shall be entitled to retain any portion of the Merger Consideration payable by
the Buyer under Article&nbsp;III that would otherwise have been paid to holders of such Dissenting
Shares pending resolution of the claims of such holders, and the Equityholders shall not be
entitled to any portion thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Loss of Dissenting Share Status</U>. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section&nbsp;3.6(a), if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who
demands appraisal of such holder&#146;s shares under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder&#146;s right to appraisal, then as of the
First Merger Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder&#146;s
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration payable by the Buyer under
Article&nbsp;III, without interest thereon, as and when payable pursuant to this Agreement, following
the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Notice of Dissenting Shares</U>. The Surviving Company shall give the Buyer:
(i)&nbsp;prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock received by the Surviving Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Surviving Company; and (ii)&nbsp;the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
appraisal. The Surviving Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer and
the Representative, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or offer to settle any such demands other than by operation
of law or pursuant to a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">3.7. <U>Escrow of Buyer Holdback Fund</U>. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement the Escrow Cash Amount (including the Escrow Note),
the Escrow Common Stock and the Escrow Preferred Stock (collectively, the &#147;<U>Buyer Holdback
Fund</U>&#148;). The Buyer Holdback Fund shall be used to satisfy certain claims of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for indemnification pursuant to Article&nbsp;X, if any, made from and after the
Closing but on or before the Expiration Date, or to cover any payments required from the
Equityholders by Section&nbsp;3.5. All payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement to the Buyer from
the Buyer Holdback Fund shall be effected by transferring from the Escrow Agent to the Buyer (a)
first, reduction of the principal amount of the Escrow Note to the extent then being held in the
Buyer Holdback Fund, (b)&nbsp;second, cash to the extent then being held in the Buyer Holdback Fund, (c)
third, shares (which may include fractional shares) of Buyer Common Stock then being held in the
Buyer Holdback Fund, based on the Buyer Common Stock Value, as adjusted to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or similar
change affecting the Buyer Common Stock, and (d)&nbsp;fourth, shares (which may include fractional
shares) of Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock based on a value of $77.30 per share of Buyer Series&nbsp;A
Preferred Stock, as adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or similar change affecting the Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Buyer Holdback Fund and release cash or shares within such
Buyer Holdback Fund solely pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Except for dividends paid in stock declared with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock and
Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund which shall be delivered by Buyer to
the Exchange Agent and shall be treated as part of the Buyer Holdback Fund, any cash dividends,
dividends payable in securities or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the Buyer
Common Stock will be delivered to the Equityholders based on their Pro Rata Portions and dividends
payable in securities or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the Buyer Series&nbsp;A
Preferred Stock will be delivered to JMI. Each Equityholder will have voting rights with respect
to the shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer Holdback
Fund with respect to such Equityholder so long as such shares are held in escrow, and Buyer will
take, and will cause the Escrow Agent to take, all reasonable steps necessary to enable the
exercise of such rights. While the shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock
held in the Buyer Holdback Fund remain in the Escrow Agent&#146;s possession pursuant to this Agreement,
the Equityholders will retain and will be able to exercise all other incidents of ownership of such
shares which are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of
federal and other taxes based on income, the parties agree that the Buyer will be treated as the
owner of the Escrow Cash Amount and will be obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned
on, or derived from, the Escrow Cash Amount as income of the Buyer, in the taxable year or years in
which such income is properly includible, and shall be obligated to pay any taxes attributable
thereto. For purposes of federal and other taxes based on income, the parties agree that the
Equityholders&nbsp;other than JMI will be treated as the owner of the Buyer Common Stock held in the
Buyer Holdback Fund and will be obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or
derived from, the Buyer Common Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund as income of the Equityholders
other than JMI, in the taxable year or years in which such income is properly includible, and shall
be obligated to pay any taxes attributable thereto.&nbsp; For purposes of federal and other taxes based
on income, the parties agree that&nbsp;JMI will be treated as the owner of the Buyer&nbsp;Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund and will be obligated to report all income, if any, that is
earned on, or derived from, the Buyer Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund as

be obligated to pay any taxes attributable thereto.

Buyer Holdback Fund shall be administered as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;If Buyer, on behalf of itself or any Buyer Indemnified Party has or claims to have

Party, deliver a written claim notice (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) to the Representative, JMI and to
the Escrow Agent. No Claim Notice may be delivered after the Expiration Date. Each Claim Notice
shall state or provide (i)&nbsp;that such Buyer Indemnified Party believes that it is entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to Article&nbsp;X, (ii)&nbsp;a reasonably detailed description of
the circumstances supporting the basis for such Buyer Indemnified Party&#146;s belief that it is
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under Article&nbsp;X, and (iii)&nbsp;to the extent estimable,
the estimated amount of Losses such Buyer Indemnified Party claims to have so incurred or suffered
(the &#147;<U>Claimed Amount</U>&#148;) provided, that the failure of the Buyer Indemnified Party to provide
the information set forth in Section&nbsp;3.8(a)(ii) and (iii)&nbsp;shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations under Article&nbsp;X except to the extent that such failure shall materially
prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt by the Representative and JMI of a Claim Notice, the
Representative and JMI shall deliver to Buyer and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the
&#147;<U>Response Notice</U>&#148;) in which the Representative and JMI either: (i)&nbsp;agree that an amount of

an amount of Applicable Escrow Property equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount may be
released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party (or, in the case of the Escrow
Note, the principal balance of such Escrow Note may be reduced); or (iii)&nbsp;indicate that no part of
the Buyer Holdback Fund may be released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party
in respect of the Claimed Amount. The Response Notice shall also contain a reasonably detailed
description of the basis for the Representative&#146;s belief that all or a portion of the Claimed
Amount shall not be released; provided, that any failure to provide such description shall not make
such notice invalid in any respect. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be
released to the Indemnified Party pursuant to the Response Notice shall be the &#147;<U>Contested
Amount</U>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If the Representative and JMI deliver a Response Notice agreeing that an amount of
Applicable Escrow Property equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Buyer Holdback

Notice on a timely basis in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.8(b), the Representative, JMI and the Buyer
shall within two (2)&nbsp;Business Days following the receipt of such Response Notice (or, if the Escrow
Agent has not received a Response Notice, within two (2)&nbsp;Business Days following the expiration of
the 30-day period referred to in Section&nbsp;3.8(b)), deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions to release from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party such amount of
Applicable Escrow Property equal to the Claimed Amount (plus a pro rata portion of the interest and
investment income deposited in the Buyer Holdback Fund from the date hereof which is attributable
to such Claimed Amount) with such distribution to be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.7.

Response Notice, deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to release from the Buyer
Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party an amount of Applicable Escrow Property equal to the
Agreed Amount (plus a pro rata portion of the interest and investment income deposited in the Buyer
Holdback Fund from the date hereof which is attributable to such Agreed Amount) with such

Contested Amount, the Escrow Agent shall not pay the Contested Amount to the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party until such Contested Amount is resolved pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.8(f).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;If the Representative or JMI delivers a Response Notice indicating that there is a
Contested Amount, the Representative, JMI and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to the claims underlying such Contested Amount. If
the Representative, JMI and the Buyer reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, if such agreement would result in a payment from
the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Representative, JMI and the Buyer
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to release from the Buyer Holdback
Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party such amount (plus a pro rata portion of the interest and

such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within 45&nbsp;days after delivery of the
Response Notice, Buyer, JMI or the Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the
Contested Amount is the subject of a pending litigation with a Third Party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration. Such arbitration
shall be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, and shall be presided over by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Representative or JMI, on the other hand (depending on which such party
delivered the Response Notice) or, if such parties cannot mutually agree on a single arbitrator, a
panel of three (3)&nbsp;arbitrators, one determined by the Buyer, one determined by JMI or the
Representative (depending on which such party delivered the Response Notice), and the third
mutually agreed on by the other two arbitrators. The decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators, as
the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any Claimed Amount shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Buyer Indemnified Parties. Such decision
shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the Buyer Holdback Fund in accordance with, the
terms of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within 30&nbsp;days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such
other party, or cause such payment to be made (including by executing and delivering mutual written

refund or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax Liability with respect

Buyer will promptly notify the Representative and JMI in writing of any Contest or proposed
Contest, to the extent that the Buyer has notice or is otherwise aware thereof, which, if
determined adversely, could result in, or cause an adjustment to, any liability for Taxes as to
which the Equityholders are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to the
provisions hereof. Any such notice shall include copies of any notice or other document received
from any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any dispute as to the settlement or compromise of a

shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns and shall deliver any such Tax Return to
the Representative and JMI for their review at least 30&nbsp;days prior to the date such Tax Return is
required to be filed. If any such Tax Return reflects a liability for Taxes that would give rise
to an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.2(b)(iv), and the Representative or JMI
disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for its objection, and the Representative, JMI and the Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith for 15&nbsp;days following the Buyer&#146;s receipt of such notice to resolve such objections. If the
Buyer, JMI and the Representative are unable to resolve all objections during such 15-day period,
then any remaining disputes, and only such remaining disputes, shall be resolved by the Accounting
Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining disputes in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement within 30&nbsp;days after its appointment. The fees, costs and

Company, Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;or Merger Sub (Corp) to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax
election or Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period if such change would cause an
increase to the Stockholders&#146; Tax liability hereunder, without the prior written consent of the
Representative and JMI, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any dispute with
respect to the foregoing shall be resolved in the same manner in which disputes are resolved in

Pre-Closing Tax Period in excess of $500,000, determined on a cumulative basis, in the aggregate.

of the date hereof, at the cost and expense of the Stockholders, cause Merger Sub (LLC), as
successor-in-interest to the Company, to file for and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and expedite any claim for (and any receipt of) refund to which the Stockholders are

Holdback Fund to the Equityholders shall be released to the Equityholders other than JMI based on
their respective Pro Rata Portions.

this Article&nbsp;X, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Stockholder and such Stockholder&#146;s successors and assigns (collectively, the &#147;<U>Stockholder
Indemnified Parties</U>&#148;) from and against any and all Losses incurred by the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

as of the Closing Date, made by the Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;and Merger Sub (Corp) in this
Agreement; or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;any breach or default in performance by the Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;and Merger Sub (Corp)

which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or Action is based
ceases to survive as set forth in Section&nbsp;10.1, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such
claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date; provided, that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to provide reasonable details of the facts and circumstances with respect to the
subject matter of such claim or Action shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under Article&nbsp;X except to the extent that such failure shall materially prejudice any defense or
claim available to the Indemnifying Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;the maximum amount of

actually received by such Equityholder in respect of such Equityholder&#146;s shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Options and/or Warrants, as applicable (including any consideration
subsequently disbursed to such Equityholder from the Buyer Holdback Fund).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(h)&nbsp;The obligations of the Equityholders to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, be reduced by any Tax benefit actually
realized as a result of the item or occurrence giving rise to the applicable indemnification

for the recovery of any Losses arising under this Agreement, whether directly or by way of
contribution, or for any other relief whatsoever, under any applicable Laws, whether now existing
or applicable or hereinafter enacted or applicable (including claims for breach of contract,
failure of disclosure or&nbsp;tortious wrong). The Company and the Principal Stockholders expressly
waive, release and agree not to make any claim against the Buyer, Merger Sub (Corp) or Merger Sub
(LLC), except for indemnification claims made pursuant to this Article&nbsp;X, for the recovery of any
Losses arising under this Agreement, whether directly or by way of contribution, or for any other
relief whatsoever, under any applicable Laws, whether now existing or applicable or hereinafter
enacted or applicable (including claims for breach of contract, failure of disclosure or&nbsp;tortious
wrong). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section&nbsp;10.6
shall be deemed to limit any claims for non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of
Buyer to pay any portion of the Merger Consideration to any Equityholder under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">10.7. <U>Third Party Claims</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article&nbsp;X (the &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) of notice of the commencement of any Action involving a
Third Party (such Action, a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim
with respect thereto is to be made against any party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Article&nbsp;X (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;), give such
Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party; <U>provided</U> that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially
prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20)&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice to assume
the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith, at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s
expense; <U>provided</U>, that (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party;
<U>provided</U>, that, except as otherwise set forth in Section&nbsp;10.7(c), the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party, and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the defense of such action only to the extent the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in writing its indemnity obligation; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees
and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (A)&nbsp;such Third Party Claim is
reasonably foreseeable to result in Losses which are more than three (3)&nbsp;times the Equityholder
Indemnification Threshold; (B)&nbsp;the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (C)&nbsp;the claim seeks
an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (D)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party has been
advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; or (E)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party failed or is
failing to use reasonable efforts to prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
claim or demand or separate but similar or related claims or demands in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, any
costs or expenses relating to a claim in which a Buyer Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party
shall be borne by the Equityholders and not the Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party shall have elected to assume the conduct and control of any
Third Party Claim pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.7(b), any Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party unless (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim in accordance with Section&nbsp;10.7(b), (ii)&nbsp;the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, or (iii)&nbsp;the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by such counsel that there may be one
(1)&nbsp;or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to the
Indemnifying Party, or available to the Indemnifying Party the assertion of which would be adverse
to the interests of the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably
contesting any such Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle
any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, that in such event it shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party for such Third Party Claim unless
the Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten (10)&nbsp;days after
the receipt of the Indemnified Party&#146;s notice of a Third Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest,
settle or compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to any judgment or settle any Third Party Claim
on account of which the Indemnified Party shall be solely responsible for any Losses unless (i)&nbsp;the
judgment or settlement does not entail any admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified
Party, (ii)&nbsp;the judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim and (iii)&nbsp;the judgment or settlement does
not include any equitable remedy binding upon the Indemnified Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Any consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under this Article&nbsp;X shall be given by the Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and any consent to be given by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under this Article&nbsp;X
shall be given by (i)&nbsp;the Representative acting on behalf of the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
and (ii)&nbsp;JMI.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">10.8. <U>Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments</U>. It is the intention of the parties hereto
to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Article&nbsp;III for all Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file
their Tax Returns accordingly, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable Tax Laws or a
final determination.

only be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
failure of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.6. <U>Binding Effect; Assignment</U>. This Agreement and the rights of the parties
hereunder may not be assigned, and the obligations of the parties hereunder may not be delegated,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer (in the case of any assignment or delegation by the
Company) or the Company before the Closing and the Representative and JMI after the Closing (in the
case of any assignment or delegation by the Buyer), and any purported assignment, delegation or
other transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable; provided, however, that
without written consent of any party hereto, (i)&nbsp;the Buyer may assign its rights and obligations to
any of its Affiliates, and (ii)&nbsp;the Buyer may assign its rights hereunder as collateral security to
any lender to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer, but no assignment shall relieve the Buyer of
any Liability hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.7. <U>No Third Party Beneficiary</U>. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights,

Agreement, except for (a)&nbsp;the provisions of Article&nbsp;X (Indemnification) with respect to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and Stockholder Indemnified Parties; (b)&nbsp;the provisions of Section&nbsp;3.1(c) with
respect to Stockholders; and (c)&nbsp;the provisions of Section&nbsp;7.4 with respect to the Indemnified

which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed to by Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;and Merger Sub (Corp).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.8. <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by the
internal laws of the State of Delaware (excluding any conflict of law, rule or principle that would
refer to the laws of another jurisdiction).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.9. <U>Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process</U>. Each party hereto irrevocably
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in the State of
Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents, and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
any such action or proceeding must be brought and/or defended in such court; provided, however,

irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent each may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court; provided that
each party hereto hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail addressed to such party shall be effective service of process for any such suit,
action or proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive
and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such
party is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment.

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A)&nbsp;CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B)&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.11. <U>Severability</U>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the
Buyer, the Company, JMI and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.12. <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (and
by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)&nbsp;transmission) with the same effect as if the
signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together
shall be deemed an original of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when, and
only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other
parties hereto. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

irrevocably appoints the Representative as such Equityholder&#146;s true and lawful attorney-in-fact,
proxy and agent, with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, in such Equityholder&#146;s name,
place and stead, in any and all capacities, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact, proxy and agent, full power
and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as fully to all
intents and purposes as such Equityholder might or could do in person, including for the purposes
of:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 11%">(i)&nbsp;taking any action on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual Equityholder
other than JMI that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Representative in
its sole discretion, in connection with the indemnification provisions set forth in
Article&nbsp;X and the amendment of this Agreement in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.2;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 11%">(ii)&nbsp;taking any action on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual Equityholder
other than JMI that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Representative in
its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or entering into settlements,
resolutions and compromises with respect to the adjustments or consideration payable under
this Agreement;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 11%">(iii)&nbsp;accepting notices on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual Equityholder
other than JMI in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.4;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 11%">(iv)&nbsp;executing and delivering, on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI, any notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the
Equityholders or any individual Equityholder other than JMI in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 11%">(v)&nbsp;granting any consent or approval on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI under this Agreement. As the representative of the
Equityholders or any individual Equityholder other than JMI under this Agreement, the
Representative shall act as the representative, agent and proxy for each Equityholder other
than JMI and shall have authority to bind each Equityholder other than JMI in accordance
with this Agreement, and no such Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary
duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely
by the express provisions of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Buyer Reliance</U>. The Buyer may rely exclusively, without independent verification
or investigation, upon all decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by the
Representative in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyer and/or the Surviving Company is entitled to deal exclusively with the
Representative and, to the extent expressly set forth herein, JMI on all matters relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any action taken or not taken or
decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by the Representative, for or on
behalf of any Equityholder other than JMI, shall be deemed an action taken or not taken or
decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by such Equityholder. Any notice or
communication delivered by the Buyer and/or the Surviving Company to the Representative and JMI
shall be deemed to have been delivered to all the Equityholders. The Buyer and/or the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to disregard any decisions, communications or writings made, given or
executed by any Equityholder other than JMI in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless the same is made, given or executed by the Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Limitation on the Representative&#146;s Liability</U>. Other than in its capacity as an
Equityholder hereunder and without limitation to its obligations hereunder in its capacity as the
Representative, the Representative shall have no liability to the Buyer and/or the Surviving
Company for any default under any this Agreement by any other Equityholder. Except for fraud,
criminal activity, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, the Representative shall
have no liability to any other Equityholder under this Agreement for any act or omission by the
Representative on behalf of the other Equityholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Retention of Counsel</U>. The Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and
to incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate
in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Representative
shall incur no liability to Equityholders with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by
them in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Representative may engage the Company&#146;s current counsel to represent the
Representative in matters relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and that such
representation would be adverse to the interests of the Surviving Company. Buyer and the Company
hereby waive any right that Buyer or the Surviving Company might have in the future to object to
any such representation. The Representative shall be reimbursed for all such third party fees,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and expenses) by the Escrow Expense
Fund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Survival</U>. All of the immunities and powers granted to the Representative under
this Agreement shall survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement. The Equityholders
other than JMI further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Equityholder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Limitation on the Buyer&#146;s Liability</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, neither the Buyer nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any Loss to any
Person, including any Equityholder, for any action taken or not taken by the Representative or for
any act or omission taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or
decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by the Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Replacement of the Representative; Assignment</U>. The Representative may be removed
by action of those Equityholders representing eighty percent (80%) of the Pro Rata Portion and such
removal shall be effective upon written notice to the Representative and the Buyer. If the
Representative (i)&nbsp;is removed by the Equityholders, (ii)&nbsp;dies or terminates its legal existence (if
not an individual), (iii)&nbsp;becomes legally incapacitated, or (iv)&nbsp;resigns from its position as
Representative, then the Equityholders representing a majority of the Pro Rata Portion shall, as
promptly as practicable thereafter, appoint a replacement Representative, which replacement
Representative shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Such appointment shall be effective
upon delivery of at least two (2)&nbsp;Business Days prior written notice to the Buyer and, thereafter,
the replacement Representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement. Any obligation of the Buyer to take any action in respect of the Representative shall
be suspended during any period that the position of Representative is vacant. Any successor to the
Representative shall succeed the Representative as Representative hereunder, and all references to
the Representative in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such successor from and after the
appointment thereof. If for any reason there is no Representative at any time, all references
herein to the Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Equityholders. No bond shall be
required of the Representative, and the Representative shall receive no compensation for his
services, other than reimbursement through the Escrow Expense Fund. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the parties agree that Updata Partners III, L.P. (&#147;Updata&#148;) may (A)&nbsp;assign
and delegate all of its rights and obligations as Representative under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Updata by providing written notice of such assignment and delegation to the other
parties hereto and/or (B)&nbsp;may deposit the Escrow Expense Fund with an escrow or similar
distribution agent selected by Updata or in a non-interest bearing account, and in each case the
costs and expenses associated therewith (including any tax reporting) may be charged to the Escrow
Expense Fund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(h)&nbsp;<U>Access to Information</U>. The Representative and JMI shall have reasonable access to
information about Buyer and the Surviving Company and the reasonable assistance of Buyer and the
Surviving Company&#146;s officers and employees for purposes of performing the Representative&#146;s duties
and exercising the Representative&#146;s and JMI&#146;s rights hereunder, provided that the Representative
and JMI shall (i)&nbsp;treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
Buyer and the Surviving Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to the Representative&#146;s
retained advisors for such matter who agree to treat such information confidentially), and (ii)&nbsp;not
have access to materials or information access to which by the Representative or JMI could result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;<U>Indemnity</U>. Each Equityholder other than JMI shall severally indemnify and hold
the Representative harmless from and against any loss, damage or deficiencies (except as result
from the Representative&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the Representative may
suffer or incur in connection with any action taken by the Representative, and each such
Equityholder shall bear its pro rata portion (based on such Equityholder&#146;s Pro Rata Portion) of
such loss, damage or deficiency. The Representative shall be fully protected by the Equityholders
other than JMI in acting on and relying upon any written notice, direction, request, waiver,
notice, consent, receipt or other paper or document which the Representative in good faith believes
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(j)&nbsp;<U>Expenses</U>. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees, shall be paid from the Expense Escrow Fund. Should the Expense Escrow Fund be
exhausted, all costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees, shall be paid severally and on a pro rata basis (based on the Equityholder&#146;s Pro
Rata Portions) by the Equityholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.14. <U>Representation by Counsel</U>. Each of the parties has been represented by and has
had an opportunity to consult legal counsel in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against or interpreted to the
disadvantage of any party by any Governmental Authority by reason of such party having drafted or
being deemed to have drafted such provision


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">11.15. <U>Buyer Guarantee</U>. Buyer, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and prompt payment by Merger Sub
(LLC)&nbsp;and Merger Sub (Corp) of all monetary obligations of Merger Sub (LLC)&nbsp;and Merger Sub (Corp)
