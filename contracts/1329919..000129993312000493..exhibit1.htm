of this Agreement and for making payments of the Merger Consideration to the
Equityholders except for the payments of cash to the holders of
Vested Company Options which shall be made by the Surviving Company in
accordance with Section 3.2(b). As soon as reasonably practicable after the
First Merger Effective Time, the Buyer will cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to the extent not already sent by the Company prior to Closing, to
each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock and Warrants, as of the First Merger Effective Time, whose shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Warrants were converted or
exchanged, as applicable, into the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, a letter of transmittal substantially
in the form of  _Exhibit H_ (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ), which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates and, if applicable,
copies of cancelled Vested Company Warrants, to the Exchange Agent, including
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for a portion of the Merger Consideration. On
or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent the Closing Cash Payment (minus (x) the Closing Cash Vested
Company Option Payment which shall be paid to the Surviving Company
for payment to the holders of Vested Company Options pursuant to Section
3.2(b) and (y) the aggregate amount of the Additional Escrow Amount Per
Escrow Participating Share delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section
3.1(c), which shall be paid to the Surviving Company for payment to the
holders of Vested Company Options pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iii)), the
Closing Cash in Lieu of Stock Payment (minus the portion of the Closing Cash
in Lieu of Stock Payment payable to the holders of Vested Company Options who
are Non-Accredited Equityholders) which shall be paid to the
Surviving Company for payment to the holders of Vested Company Options who
are Non-Accredited Equityholders pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii), the Closing
Buyer Common Stock Payment (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form) and the shares of Closing Preferred Stock (collectively, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the applicable payments of the Closing Cash Payment,
the Closing Buyer Common Stock Payment, the Closing Cash in Lieu of Stock
Payment and the shares of Closing Preferred Stock to the Equityholders out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Buyer shall cause the shares of Closing Preferred Stock to be delivered to
JMI at the Closing subject to the Buyers receipt at or prior to the Closing
of Certificates representing all of the JMI Shares and a Letter of
Transmittal duly executed by JMI.   

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Options and Warrants that have been converted or exchanged, as applicable,
into the right to receive a portion of the Exchange Fund, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto or,
if applicable, a properly completed and duly executed Surrender Agreement,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Buyer or the
Exchange Agent, will be paid in exchange therefor cash, shares of Buyer
Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares) and/or shares of Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock representing, in the aggregate, the portion and type of the Exchange
Fund that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article III (less any required Tax withholding). Such cash and/or shares
shall be paid as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two Business
Days) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificates and letter of
transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any consideration from the Exchange Fund. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall, after the First Merger Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such portion and type of the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Sections 3.1 and 3.2.   

(c) If any shares issuable under this Article III are to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition thereof that
the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the
shares issuable hereunder shall pay to the Exchange Agent any required
transfer or other similar Taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   

(d) After the First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall not register the
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred
Stock, Options or Warrants. From and after the First Merger Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock,
shares of Company Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants outstanding immediately
prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred
Stock, Options or Warrants except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. If, after the First Merger Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article III.   

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock, Options or
Warrants six months after the First Merger Effective Time shall be returned
to the Buyer, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or
her shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred
Stock, Options or Warrants for a portion of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Buyer for delivery of the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock,
shares of Company Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Buyer, the Surviving Company nor the Company shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company
Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants for any consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this Agreement
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of
Company Preferred Stock, Options or Warrants immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.   

3.5. _Cash Consideration Adjustments_.   

(a) _Closing Statement_. Included on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
are estimates of the (i) Net Closing Cash, (ii) Transaction Expenses, (iii)
Net Working Capital, and (iv) the Adjustment Amount (such item (iv), the "
_Estimated Adjustment Amount_ "). Within 90 days following the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative and JMI a balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing and a certificate executed by an
executive officer of the Buyer (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Buyers determination of the actual (i) Net Closing Cash, (ii)
Transaction Expenses, (iii) Net Working Capital, and (iv) the Adjustment
Amount, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
Companys past practices (to the extent such past practices were in
accordance with GAAP). Following delivery of the Closing Statement, the Buyer
shall provide the Representative and JMI with trial balances and supporting
schedules relevant to such determinations prepared by Buyer or
its accountants. Buyer shall also provide the Representative and its
accountants with timely access, during the Buyers normal business hours, to
the personnel, properties, books and records of Buyer, Merger Sub (Corp),
Merger Sub (LLC) and the Surviving Company as may be reasonably requested by
the Representative to the extent related to the determination of the items
set forth on the Closing Statement.   

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. Within 30 days after the Representatives receipt
of the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a
written statement either accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any
objections thereto in reasonable detail (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If
the Representative accepts the Closing Statement or does not deliver an
Objections Statement within such 30-day period, then the Closing Statement
shall become final and binding upon all parties. If the Representative does
deliver an Objections Statement within such 30-day period, then the
Representative and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for 15 days
following the Buyers receipt of such Objections Statement to resolve such
objections (any unresolved objection, a " _Dispute_ "). After such 15-day
period, any item or matter set forth in the Closing Statement that is not a
Dispute shall become final and binding upon all parties. If the Buyer and the
Representative are unable to resolve all Disputes during such 15-day period,
then any remaining Disputes, and only such remaining Disputes, shall be
resolved by Ernst and Young LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP is not available for
such assignment, such other nationally or regionally recognized accounting
firm upon which the Buyer and the Representative shall reasonably agree
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to
resolve any such remaining Disputes in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within 30 days after its appointment. The resolution of such
Disputes by the Accounting Firm (i) shall be set forth in writing, (ii) shall
be within the range of dispute between the Buyer and the Representative,
(iii) shall constitute an arbitral award, and (iv) shall be conclusive and
binding upon all the parties upon which a judgment may be rendered by a court
having proper jurisdiction thereover. Upon delivery of such resolution, the
Closing Statement, as modified in accordance with such resolution, shall
become final and binding upon all parties.   

(c) _Fees and Expenses of Accounting Firm_. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Buyer if the Buyer is the
non-prevailing party or solely by the Equityholders if the Representative is
the non-prevailing party. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "non-
prevailing party" shall be the party whose proposed calculation of
the Adjustment Amount submitted to the Accounting Firm was further from the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount as finally determined. If the
Equityholders are required to bear the fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm, such fees, costs and expenses shall be satisfied through
the payment of such fees, costs and expenses by the Buyer and a deduction of
the amount thereof from the Escrow Cash Amount. In such event the Buyer and
the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release such amount
from the Escrow Cash Amount to the Buyer.   

(d) _Final Adjustment Amount_. As used herein, " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "
means (i) if the Representative accepts the Closing Statement in writing or
fails to deliver an Objections Statement within the time period specified in
Section 3.5(b), the Adjustment Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement,
or (ii) if the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Closing Statement is
resolved by resolution of the Buyer and the Representative or by submission of
any remaining Disputes to the Accounting Firm, as contemplated by Section
3.5(b), the Adjustment Amount as so resolved. If the Final Adjustment Amount
is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the Buyer shall
promptly (but in any event within five Business Days following
the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) deliver cash in the amount
of such difference to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the
Equityholders other than JMI (based on their respective Pro Rata Portions).
If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
then the Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver from the Escrow Cash Amount an amount in cash from the Escrow Fund
equal to such difference. All consideration payable pursuant to this Section
3.5 shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to
the consideration payable by the Buyer under Article III.   

3.6. _Dissenting Shares_.   

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such demand
for appraisal of such holders shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the
Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders right to
such appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive any portion of the consideration payable in accordance with
Article III, but shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the
DGCL. The Buyer shall be entitled to retain any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable by the Buyer under Article III that would otherwise
have been paid to holders of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the
claims of such holders, and the Equityholders shall not be entitled to any
portion thereof.   

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 3.6(a), if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock who demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or
otherwise) such holders right to appraisal, then as of the First Merger
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such
holders shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as
applicable, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the
applicable consideration payable by the Buyer under Article III, without
interest thereon, as and when payable pursuant to this Agreement,
following the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock.   

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Surviving Company shall give the
Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock received by the Surviving Company,
withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Surviving Company; and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands
for appraisal. The Surviving Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Buyer and the Representative, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock or offer to settle any such demands other than by
operation of law or pursuant to a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.   

3.7. _Escrow of Buyer Holdback Fund_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit
with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement the Escrow Cash Amount
(including the Escrow Note), the Escrow Common Stock and the Escrow Preferred
Stock (collectively, the " _Buyer Holdback Fund_ "). The Buyer Holdback Fund
shall be used to satisfy certain claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
indemnification pursuant to Article X, if any, made from and after
the Closing but on or before the Expiration Date, or to cover any payments
required from the Equityholders by Section 3.5. All payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement to the Buyer from the Buyer Holdback Fund shall be
effected by transferring from the Escrow Agent to the Buyer (a) first,
reduction of the principal amount of the Escrow Note to the extent then being
held in the Buyer Holdback Fund, (b) second, cash to the extent then being
held in the Buyer Holdback Fund, (c) third, shares (which may include
fractional shares) of Buyer Common Stock then being held in the Buyer
Holdback Fund, based on the Buyer Common Stock Value, as adjusted to reflect
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization or similar change affecting the Buyer Common
Stock, and (d) fourth, shares (which may include fractional shares) of Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock based on a value of $77.30 per share of Buyer Series
A Preferred Stock, as adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar change affecting the Buyer Series A Preferred Stock. The Escrow Agent
shall hold the Buyer Holdback Fund and release cash or shares within
such Buyer Holdback Fund solely pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. Except for dividends paid in stock declared with
respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund which shall be delivered by Buyer
to the Exchange Agent and shall be treated as part of the Buyer Holdback
Fund, any cash dividends, dividends payable in securities or other
distributions of any kind made in respect of the Buyer Common Stock will be
delivered to the Equityholders based on their Pro Rata Portions and
dividends payable in securities or other distributions of any kind made in
respect of the Buyer Series A Preferred Stock will be delivered to JMI. Each
Equityholder will have voting rights with respect to the shares of Buyer
Common Stock and Buyer Series A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer
Holdback Fund with respect to such Equityholder so long as such shares are
held in escrow, and Buyer will take, and will cause the Escrow Agent to take,
all reasonable steps necessary to enable the exercise of such rights. While
the shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series A Preferred Stock held in
the Buyer Holdback Fund remain in the Escrow Agents possession pursuant to
this Agreement, the Equityholders will retain and will be able to exercise
all other incidents of ownership of such shares which are not inconsistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of federal and
other taxes based on income, the parties agree that the Buyer will be treated
as the owner of the Escrow Cash Amount and will be obligated to report all
income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Cash Amount as
income of the Buyer, in the taxable year or years in which such income is
properly includible, and shall be obligated to pay any taxes
attributable thereto. For purposes of federal and other taxes based on
income, the parties agree that the Equityholders other than JMI will be
treated as the owner of the Buyer Common Stock held in the Buyer Holdback
Fund and will be obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned on,
or derived from, the Buyer Common Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund as
income of the Equityholders other than JMI, in the taxable year or years in
which such income is properly includible, and shall be obligated to pay any
taxes attributable thereto. For purposes of federal and other taxes based on
income, the parties agree that JMI will be treated as the owner of the Buyer
Series A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund and will be
obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from,
the Buyer Series A Preferred Stock held in the Buyer Holdback Fund as income
of JMI, in the taxable year or years in which such income is properly
includible, and shall be obligated to pay any taxes attributable
thereto.   

3.8. _Administration of Buyer Holdback Fund_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Buyer Holdback Fund shall be administered as follows:   

(a) If Buyer, on behalf of itself or any Buyer Indemnified Party has or claims
to have incurred or suffered Losses for which it is or may be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under Article X of this Agreement, Buyer
shall, on behalf of itself or such Buyer Indemnified Party, deliver a written
claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Representative, JMI and to the
Escrow Agent. No Claim Notice may be delivered after the Expiration Date. Each
Claim Notice shall state or provide (i) that such Buyer Indemnified Party
believes that it is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to
Article X, (ii) a reasonably detailed description of the circumstances
supporting the basis for such Buyer Indemnified Partys belief that it
is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under Article X, and (iii) to
the extent estimable, the estimated amount of Losses such Buyer Indemnified
Party claims to have so incurred or suffered (the " _Claimed Amount_ ")
provided, that the failure of the Buyer Indemnified Party to provide the
information set forth in Section 3.8(a)(ii) and (iii) shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Article X except to the extent
that such failure shall materially prejudice any defense or claim available
to the Indemnifying Party.   

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Representative and JMI of a
Claim Notice, the Representative and JMI shall deliver to Buyer and to the
Escrow Agent a written response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the
Representative and JMI either: (i) agree that an amount of the Escrow Note,
cash, Buyer Common Stock and/or Buyer Series A Preferred Stock, determined
in accordance with Section 3.7 (the " _Applicable Escrow Property_ ") equal
to the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to
the Buyer Indemnified Party; (ii) agree that an amount of Applicable Escrow
Property equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount may be released
from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party (or, in the case
of the Escrow Note, the principal balance of such Escrow Note may be
reduced); or (iii) indicate that no part of the Buyer Holdback Fund may be
released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party in
respect of the Claimed Amount. The Response Notice shall also contain a
reasonably detailed description of the basis for the Representatives belief
that all or a portion of the Claimed Amount shall not be released; provided,
that any failure to provide such description shall not make such notice
invalid in any respect. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to
be released to the Indemnified Party pursuant to the Response Notice shall be
the " _Contested Amount_."   

(c) If the Representative and JMI deliver a Response Notice agreeing that an
amount of Applicable Escrow Property equal to the full Claimed Amount may be
released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party, or if
neither the Representative nor JMI deliver a Response Notice on a timely
basis in accordance with Section 3.8(b), the Representative, JMI and the
Buyer shall within two (2) Business Days following the receipt of such
Response Notice (or, if the Escrow Agent has not received a Response Notice,
within two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the 30-day period
referred to in Section 3.8(b)), deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions to release from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer
Indemnified Party such amount of Applicable Escrow Property equal to the
Claimed Amount (plus a pro rata portion of the interest and investment income
deposited in the Buyer Holdback Fund from the date hereof which is
attributable to such Claimed Amount) with such distribution to be made in
accordance with Section 3.7.   

(d) If the Representative and JMI deliver a Response Notice agreeing that an
amount of Applicable Escrow Property equal to or less than the full Claimed
Amount may be released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified
Party (the " _Agreed Amount_ "), the Representative, JMI and the Buyer shall,
within two (2) Business Days following the receipt of such Response Notice,
deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to release from the
Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party an amount of Applicable
Escrow Property equal to the Agreed Amount (plus a pro rata portion of the
interest and investment income deposited in the Buyer Holdback Fund from the
date hereof which is attributable to such Agreed Amount) with
such distribution to be made in accordance with Section 3.7.   

(e) If the Representative or JMI delivers a Response Notice indicating that
there is a Contested Amount, the Escrow Agent shall not pay the Contested
Amount to the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party until such Contested Amount
is resolved pursuant to Section 3.8(f).   

(f) If the Representative or JMI delivers a Response Notice indicating that
there is a Contested Amount, the Representative, JMI and Buyer shall attempt
in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect
to the claims underlying such Contested Amount. If the Representative, JMI
and the Buyer reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, if such agreement
would result in a payment from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the Representative, JMI and the Buyer shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to release from the Buyer
Holdback Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party such amount (plus a pro rata
portion of the interest and investment income deposited in the Buyer Holdback
Fund from the date hereof which is attributable to such Agreed Amount), with
such distribution to be made in accordance with Section 3.7. If no such
agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within 45 days after
delivery of the Response Notice, Buyer, JMI or the Representative may demand
arbitration of the matter unless the Contested Amount is the subject of a
pending litigation with a Third Party, in which event arbitration shall not
be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree
to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and shall
be presided over by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Representative or JMI, on the other hand (depending on which
such party delivered the Response Notice) or, if such parties cannot mutually
agree on a single arbitrator, a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one
determined by the Buyer, one determined by JMI or the Representative
(depending on which such party delivered the Response Notice), and the
third mutually agreed on by the other two arbitrators. The decision of the
arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount
of any Claimed Amount shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement and the Buyer Indemnified Parties. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on, and make distributions from the Buyer Holdback Fund in accordance with,
the terms of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within 30
days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to
another, such party shall make the payment to such other party, or cause such
payment to be made (including by executing and delivering mutual
written instructions to the Escrow Agent) including any distributions out of
the Buyer Holdback Fund, as applicable. The fees, costs and expenses of the
arbitrator(s) shall be borne solely by the Buyer if the Buyer is the non-
prevailing party or solely by the Equityholders if the Representative is
the non-prevailing party. If the Equityholders are required to bear the fees,
costs and expenses of the arbitrator(s), such fees, costs and expenses shall
be satisfied through the payment of such fees, costs and expenses by the
Buyer and a deduction of the amount thereof from the Escrow Cash Amount and,
if such amount is not sufficient to pay such fees, costs and expenses, the
Equityholders shall pay them on a several basis in accordance with their
Consideration Portions. In such event the Buyer, JMI and the Representative
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release such amount from the Escrow Cash
Amount to the Buyer.   

3.9. _Escrow of Escrow Expense Fund_. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver the Escrow Expense Fund to the Representative pursuant to wire
instructions provided by the Representative. The Escrow Expense Fund shall be
available to compensate the Representative for any expenses incurred by the
Representative in accordance with its rights and obligations hereunder. For
purposes of federal and other taxes based on income, the parties agree that
the Escrow Participants will be (i) treated as receiving the Escrow Expense
Fund at the Closing, (ii) treated as the owners of the Escrow Expense Fund,
and (iii) obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or
derived from, the Escrow Expense Fund as income of the Escrow Participants, in
the taxable year or years in which such income is properly includible, and
shall be obligated to pay any taxes attributable thereto. Upon distribution
of any remaining funds in the Escrow Expense Fund to the Escrow Participants,
the Representative shall have no obligation to withhold any amount with
respect thereto.   

3.10. _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will
be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
Vested Company Options and Vested Company Warrants who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be received by such
holder) shall receive from Buyer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
Buyer Common Stock Value.

the Contemplated Transactions.

13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). As of December 31, 2011, Buyers
chief executive officer and chief financial officer have (i) designed such
internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control
over financial reporting to be designed under their supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, and (ii) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under their
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to Buyer is made
known to them by others within Buyer during the period in which Buyer is
required to disclose such information in its reports filed with, or submitted
to, the SEC. As of December 31, 2011, Buyers chief executive officer and
chief financial officer have (i) evaluated the effectiveness of Buyers
disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that Buyers disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports that Buyer files or submits
under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to
management, including Buyers chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii)
concluded that Buyers internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2011. There were no changes in Buyers internal
controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
Buyers internal control over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation
described in the previous sentence, Buyers chief executive officer and
chief financial officer have disclosed to Buyers auditors and audit
committee, as of December 31, 2011, (x) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Buyers
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Buyers internal control over
financial reporting..   

6.9. _Merger Sub (LLC) and Merger Sub (Corp)_. Merger Sub (Corp) has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated

Buyer.

Schedule and the certificates delivered by Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC) and Merger
Sub (Corp) pursuant to this Agreement, taken as a whole, does not contain any

Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing or any indemnification agreement between the Company and such
director or officer (to the extent disclosed in _Schedule 4.12_). In the
event any claim in respect of which indemnification is available pursuant to

decrees or other rulings in connection with such claim are fully
satisfied.   

(b) If not purchased by the Company prior to the First Merger Effective Time,
Surviving Company shall purchase, promptly after Closing, the "tail policy"
provided for by the Companys current directors and officers insurance, at
a cost not to exceed $90,000 with such cost to be treated as a Transaction

own choosing, of any audit, claim for refund or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax Liability with respect to the Company
(any such audit or proceeding referenced to herein as a " _Contest_ ").
The Buyer will promptly notify the Representative and JMI in writing of any
Contest or proposed Contest, to the extent that the Buyer has notice or is
otherwise aware thereof, which, if determined adversely, could result in, or
cause an adjustment to, any liability for Taxes as to which the Equityholders
are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
the provisions hereof. Any such notice shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability.   

(b) In the case of a Contest that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
Representative and JMI shall have the right to participate in such Contest,
at their own expense, and the Buyer shall keep the Representative and JMI
fully informed with respect thereto. In addition, the Buyer shall not have
the right to settle or compromise any issue or matter with respect to any
Contest to the extent that the Equityholders would be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, and subsequent to such
time as the Equityholders have become obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to Tax in excess of $500,000 in the
aggregate, without the prior written consent of the Representative and JMI,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any
dispute as to the settlement or compromise of a Contest in accordance with
the foregoing shall be resolved in the same manner in which disputes
are resolved in Section 8.2(b) hereof.   

(c) The Representative shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Buyer,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c) hereof, the
Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file (or cause to
be filed) all Tax Returns of the Company.   

(b) In the case of Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to
any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
Tax Period_ "), the Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax
Returns and shall deliver any such Tax Return to the Representative and JMI
for their review at least 30 days prior to the date such Tax Return
is required to be filed. If any such Tax Return reflects a liability for
Taxes that would give rise to an indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 10.2(b)(iv), and the Representative or JMI disputes any item on such
Tax Return, it shall notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis for its objection, and the Representative, JMI and the Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith for 15 days following the Buyers receipt of such
notice to resolve such objections. If the Buyer, JMI and the Representative
are unable to resolve all objections during such 15-day period, then any
remaining disputes, and only such remaining disputes, shall be resolved by the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such
remaining disputes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30
days after its appointment. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be allocated equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Representative and JMI, on the other hand.   

(c) With respect to any Tax Returns filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 8.3 and Section
8.4 hereof and the limitation on the indemnification obligations related to
Taxes set forth in Section 10.2(b), the Stockholders shall be responsible for
the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. The
Stockholders shall remit such Tax payments to the Buyer no later than five
Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due. Any dispute as to the
amount due from the Stockholders in accordance with the foregoing shall be
resolved in the same manner in which disputes are resolved in Section
8.2(b) hereof.   

(d) The Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by Law, prepare the Tax Returns
of the Company described in Section 8.2(b) in a manner consistent with the
Companys prior practice. Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate thereof shall
amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Company, Merger Sub
(LLC) or Merger Sub (Corp) to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any
Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period if such
change would cause an increase to the Stockholders Tax liability hereunder,
without the prior written consent of the Representative and JMI, not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any dispute with respect to
the foregoing shall be resolved in the same manner in which disputes are
resolved in Section 8.2(b). The Stockholders shall be entitled to all refunds
of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in excess of $500,000,
determined on a cumulative basis, in the aggregate. The Buyer shall, if the
Representative so requests in writing on or prior to the first anniversary of
the date hereof, at the cost and expense of the Stockholders, cause Merger Sub
(LLC), as successor-in-interest to the Company, to file for and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and expedite any claim for (and any
receipt of) refund to which the Stockholders are entitled under this Section
8.2(d), provided that doing so is, in Buyers reasonable opinion, lawful, and
will not result in an adverse Tax or other consequence to the Buyer.   

8.3. _Conveyance Taxes_. The Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on
the other hand, shall each pay 50% of all sales, use, value added, transfer,
stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or
similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Stockholders and the Buyer shall jointly file all required
change of ownership and similar statements.   

8.4. _Federal and State Income Tax Liability Incurred in Connection with
the Mergers_.8.5. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, any
federal or state income tax liability of the Company, Merger Sub (Corp) or
Merger Sub (LLC) that is incurred solely and directly as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the
Equityholders, and the Equityholders shall, pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iv)
hereof, indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to fifty percent
(50%) thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any provision hereof to the
contrary, to the extent that any such Tax liability is incurred due to
the breach by Buyer of the covenants made by Buyer in the second, third, or
fourth sentences of Section 7.5 hereof, or the breach by Buyer of the
representations set forth in Section 6.9 hereof (collectively, the " _Buyer
Tax Provisions_ "), (i) the Equityholders shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, and (ii) the
Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties

breach of a Company Fundamental Representation or pursuant to Section

Holdback Fund is insufficient to satisfy the entire amount of the Losses
determined to be owed to the applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties arising

shall release all remaining cash and all remaining shares of Buyer Common
Stock and/or Buyer Series A Preferred Stock to the Equityholders less
a sufficient amount of cash and a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock and/or Buyer Series A Preferred Stock as necessary to fully satisfy any
Pending Indemnity Claims (each, an " _Interim Distribution Amount_ ").
Following the Expiration Date, once all Pending Indemnification Claims are
resolved and all appropriate amounts from the Buyer Holdback Fund shall have
been paid to the Buyer in satisfaction of such claims, the Escrow Agent shall
release all remaining cash and all remaining shares of Buyer Common Stock
and/or Buyer Series A Preferred Stock to the Equityholders (the " _Final
Distribution Amount_ "). Any shares of Buyer Series A Preferred Stock to be
released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Equityholders shall be
released solely to JMI, and any cash and/or shares of Buyer Common Stock to
be released from the Buyer Holdback Fund to the Equityholders shall be
released to the Equityholders other than JMI based on their respective Pro
Rata Portions.   

(d) Each of the Expiration Date Distribution Amount, Interim Distribution
Amounts and the Final Distribution Amount shall be released by the Escrow
Agent to the Equityholders as provided herein.   

10.4. _Indemnification of the Stockholders_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article X, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder and such Stockholders
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Stockholder Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any and all Losses incurred by the
Stockholder Indemnified Parties resulting from or arising out of any of the
following:   

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing Date, made by the Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC)
and Merger Sub (Corp) in this Agreement; or   

(b) any breach or default in performance by the Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC) and
Merger Sub (Corp) of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement or in any document delivered with respect hereto or
thereto; or   

(c) any breach of, inaccuracy in, or default in performance, as applicable, by
the Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC) or Merger Sub (Corp) with respect to the Buyer
Tax Provisions.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any provision hereof to the contrary, to the
extent that any Stockholder incurs any Tax liability as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect
to the receipt by such Stockholder of Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred
Stock, the Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify such Stockholder for
such Tax liability other than in accordance with Section 10.4(c).   

10.5. _Limitations_.   

(a) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against any party
for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, unless written notice of such claim or Action is received by such
party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date
on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such
claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 10.1,
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have
occurred before or after such date; provided, that the failure of
the Indemnified Party to provide reasonable details of the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Article X
except to the extent that such failure shall materially prejudice any defense
or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.   

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the maximum
amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from all indemnification
claims (including claims based on breach of any of the Company Fundamental
Representations) shall be an amount equal to the value of the Merger
Consideration (with shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock valued in the manner set forth in Section 3.7), as adjusted pursuant to
Section 3.5; (ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Equityholder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out
of or resulting from all indemnification claims (including claims based on
breach of any of the Company Fundamental Representations and a Principal
Stockholders representations, warranties, covenants and agreements,
including such Principal Stockholders Fundamental Representations) shall be
an amount equal to the value of the Merger Consideration (with shares
of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Series A Preferred Stock valued in the manner
set forth in Section 3.7) actually received by such Equityholder, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.5; and (iii) the maximum amount of any specific
indemnifiable Loss which may be recovered from an Equityholder by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from all indemnification
claims (including claims based on breach of any of the Company Fundamental
Representations) under Section 10.2(b) shall be an amount equal to such
Equityholders Consideration Portion of such Loss. There shall be no cap on
the amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for claims arising out of fraud; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Equityholder shall have any liability for the fraud of
any other Equityholder.   

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the aggregate
liability of the Buyer to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties for
Losses under Section 10.4(a) other than Losses arising from claims based on
breach of any of the Buyer Fundamental Representations or fraud, shall in no
event exceed an amount equal to $15,000,000, and (ii) the maximum
aggregate liability of the Buyer to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties for Losses arising from claims based on a breach of the Buyer
Fundamental Representations, agreements or covenants shall be an amount equal
to the value of the Merger Consideration. There shall be no cap on the amount
of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties arising out of fraud.   

(d) There shall be no liability of any Equityholder for indemnification under
Section 10.2(b), unless the aggregate amount of Losses thereunder exceeds
$500,000 (the " _Equityholder Indemnification Threshold_ "), at which time
the Equityholders will only be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to the aggregate amount of all such Losses described in
Section 10.2(b) in excess of $500,000.   

(e) There shall be no liability for indemnification under Section 10.4(a),
unless the aggregate amount of Losses thereunder exceeds $500,000 (the "
_Buyer Indemnification Threshold_ "), at which time Buyer will only be
obligated to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties with respect to
the aggregate amount of all such Losses described in Section 10.4(a) in
excess of $500,000.   

(f) If Buyer has Knowledge of a claim for breach of a representation or
warranty at Closing, Buyer must give the Representative written notice of
such claim immediately prior to the Closing.   

(g) Liability of any Equityholder under this Article X for Losses which may be
recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties other than from the Buyer Holdback
Fund shall be several and not joint and shall be calculated in accordance
with such Equityholders respective Consideration Portion, provided that in
no event shall an Equityholder be liable for more than the
consideration actually received by such Equityholder in respect of such
Equityholders shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Options and/or Warrants, as applicable (including any
consideration subsequently disbursed to such Equityholder from the Buyer
Holdback Fund).   

(h) The obligations of the Equityholders to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties hereunder shall, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, be reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized as a result of the
item or occurrence giving rise to the applicable indemnification obligation
in the Tax year giving rise to the applicable indemnification obligation, as
calculated on a with and without basis, and the reasonably estimated present
value of any future Tax benefit, taking all facts and circumstances into
account, as determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with procedures
substantially similar to those set forth in Section 3.5(b) hereof, if the
parties are unable to reach agreement thereon.   

(i) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to recover any Losses
to which such fact, circumstance or event gave rise more than once.   

(j) In no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover any
Losses to the extent subject to a reserve or reflected in the Financial
Statements.   

(k) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses incurred in
connection with any breach of any representation or warranty but not for
purposes of determining whether a breach of such representation or warranty
has occurred, the words "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" contained in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded   

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of
determining each Equityholders liability or responsibility for Losses under
this Article 10 (other than Section 10.2(a)) or for fees, costs or expenses
of arbitration under Section 3.8(f), such liability or responsibility shall
be allocated (i) pursuant to Section 3.7 and subject thereto to the
extent covered by the Buyer Holdback Fund and (ii) in accordance with such
Equityholders respective Consideration Portion to the extent not covered by
the Buyer Holdback Fund.   

10.6. _Limitation on Remedies_. From and after the Closing, and except with
respect to claims arising from fraud or claims for equitable relief, the
provisions of this Article X shall constitute the exclusive remedy in respect
of breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement. Buyer, Merger Sub (Corp), Merger Sub (LLC), on behalf
of themselves and the Buyer Indemnified Parties, expressly waive, release and
agree not to make any claim against the Equityholders, except for
indemnification claims made pursuant to this Article X, for the recovery of
any Losses arising under this Agreement, whether directly or by way
of contribution, or for any other relief whatsoever, under any applicable
Laws, whether now existing or applicable or hereinafter enacted or applicable
(including claims for breach of contract, failure of disclosure or tortious
wrong). The Company and the Principal Stockholders expressly waive, release
and agree not to make any claim against the Buyer, Merger Sub (Corp) or Merger
Sub (LLC), except for indemnification claims made pursuant to this Article X,
for the recovery of any Losses arising under this Agreement, whether directly
or by way of contribution, or for any other relief whatsoever, under any
applicable Laws, whether now existing or applicable or hereinafter enacted or
applicable (including claims for breach of contract, failure of disclosure or
tortious wrong). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 10.6 shall be deemed to limit any claims for non-
fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer to pay any
portion of the Merger Consideration to any Equityholder under this
Agreement.   

10.7. _Third Party Claims_.   

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article X (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the
commencement of any Action involving a Third Party (such Action, a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect
thereto is to be made against any party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this Article X (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to such
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give
notice shall materially prejudice any defense or claim available to the
Indemnifying Party.   

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days after receipt of such
notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
of the settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense; _provided_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , that, except as
otherwise set forth in Section 10.7(c), the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by such Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its indemnity obligation; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) such Third Party Claim is reasonably
foreseeable to result in Losses which are more than three (3) times the
Equityholder Indemnification Threshold; (B) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (C) the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (D) the Indemnified Party has
been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party; or (E) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to use reasonable
efforts to prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall
the Indemnifying Party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim or demand or
separate but similar or related claims or demands in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
For the avoidance of doubt, any costs or expenses relating to a claim in
which a Buyer Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party shall be borne by
the Equityholders and not the Representative.   

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall have elected to assume the conduct and
control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.7(b), any Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or
claim and to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with Section
10.7(b), (ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized
in writing by the Indemnifying Party, or (iii) the named parties to any such
action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised
in writing by such counsel that there may be one (1) or more legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to
the Indemnifying Party, or available to the Indemnifying Party the assertion
of which would be adverse to the interests of the Indemnified Party. So long
as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such Third Party Claim
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that in
such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying
Party for such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have
consented to such payment or settlement.   

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten
(10) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a Third
Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or
compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.   

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to any judgment or settle any
Third Party Claim on account of which the Indemnified Party shall be solely
responsible for any Losses unless (i) the judgment or settlement does not
entail any admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party, (ii)
the judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim and
(iii) the judgment or settlement does not include any equitable remedy
binding upon the Indemnified Party.   

(f) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Any
consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Article X
shall be given by the Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and any consent to be given by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under this
Article X shall be given by (i) the Representative acting on behalf of the
Stockholder Indemnified Parties and (ii) JMI.   

10.8. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. It is the intention of the
parties hereto to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Article III for
all Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns
accordingly, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable Tax Laws
or a final determination.

by this Agreement; provided, however, the Buyer will, at the Closing,

Such addresses may be changed, from time to time, by means of a notice given
in the manner provided in this Section 11.4.   

11.5. _Waiver_. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by any party
shall only be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.   

11.6. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights of the
parties hereunder may not be assigned, and the obligations of the parties
hereunder may not be delegated, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer (in the case of any assignment or delegation by the Company) or the
Company before the Closing and the Representative and JMI after the Closing
(in the case of any assignment or delegation by the Buyer), and any purported
assignment, delegation or other transfer without such consent shall be void
and unenforceable; provided, however, that without written consent of any
party hereto, (i) the Buyer may assign its rights and obligations to any of
its Affiliates, and (ii) the Buyer may assign its rights hereunder as
collateral security to any lender to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer,
but no assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any Liability hereunder. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.   

11.7. _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any
rights, remedies or claims upon any Person not a party or a permitted
assignee of a party to this Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of
Article X (Indemnification) with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
Stockholder Indemnified Parties; (b) the provisions of Section 3.1(c)
with respect to Stockholders; and (c) the provisions of Section 7.4 with
respect to the Indemnified Company Parties and their heirs and
representatives; provided, however, that JMI and the Representative (on
behalf of the Equityholders) shall be entitled and have the right to pursue
and recover damages (including damages based on the consideration that would
have otherwise been payable to the Equityholders) in the name of and on
behalf of the Equityholders in the event of any breach by Buyer, Merger Sub
(LLC) or Merger Sub (Corp) of this Agreement or in the event of fraud, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed to by Buyer, Merger Sub (LLC) and
Merger Sub (Corp).   

11.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware (excluding any
conflict of law, rule or principle that would refer to the laws of another
jurisdiction).   

11.9. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Each party hereto
irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal
courts located in the State of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
of any such action or proceeding must be brought and/or defended in such
court; provided, however, that matters which are under the jurisdiction of
the federal courts in Delaware shall be brought in the United States Federal
District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Each party hereto consents to service
of process by any means authorized by the applicable law of the forum in any
action brought under or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, and each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent each may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court; provided
that each party hereto hereby agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party shall be
effective service of process for any such suit, action or proceeding brought
against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any
other courts to whose jurisdiction such party is or may be subject by suit
upon such judgment.   

11.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.   

11.11. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Buyer, the Company, JMI and the Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   

11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts (and by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)
transmission) with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be
deemed an original of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when, and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and provisions of this Agreement.   

11.13. _The Representative_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to
applicable Law:   

(a) _Appointment of the Representative_. Each Equityholder other than JMI
hereby irrevocably appoints the Representative as such Equityholders true
and lawful attorney-in-fact, proxy and agent, with full powers of
substitution and resubstitution, in such Equityholders name, place and
stead, in any and all capacities, in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-
fact, proxy and agent, full power and authority to do and perform each and
every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as fully to
all intents and purposes as such Equityholder might or could do in person,
including for the purposes of:    

(i) taking any action on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI that may be necessary or desirable, as determined
by the Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article X and the amendment of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 11.2;    

(ii) taking any action on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI that may be necessary or desirable, as determined
by the Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating
or entering into settlements, resolutions and compromises with respect to the
adjustments or consideration payable under this Agreement;    

(iii) accepting notices on behalf of the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI in accordance with Section 11.4;    

(iv) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Equityholders or any
individual Equityholder other than JMI, any notices, documents or
certificates to be executed by the Equityholders or any individual
Equityholder other than JMI in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and    

(v) granting any consent or approval on behalf of the Equityholders or any
individual Equityholder other than JMI under this Agreement. As the
representative of the Equityholders or any individual Equityholder other than
JMI under this Agreement, the Representative shall act as the representative,
agent and proxy for each Equityholder other than JMI and shall have authority
to bind each Equityholder other than JMI in accordance with this Agreement,
and no such Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.   

The Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including
any fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties and
obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement.   

(b) _Buyer Reliance_. The Buyer may rely exclusively, without independent
verification or investigation, upon all decisions, communications or writings
made, given or executed by the Representative in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer
and/or the Surviving Company is entitled to deal exclusively with
the Representative and, to the extent expressly set forth herein, JMI on all
matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or
writings made, given or executed by the Representative, for or on behalf of
any Equityholder other than JMI, shall be deemed an action taken or not taken
or decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by such
Equityholder. Any notice or communication delivered by the Buyer and/or the
Surviving Company to the Representative and JMI shall be deemed to have been
delivered to all the Equityholders. The Buyer and/or the Surviving Company
shall be entitled to disregard any decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by any Equityholder other than JMI in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless the same
is made, given or executed by the Representative.   

(c) _Limitation on the Representative s Liability_. Other than in its
capacity as an Equityholder hereunder and without limitation to its
obligations hereunder in its capacity as the Representative, the
Representative shall have no liability to the Buyer and/or the
Surviving Company for any default under any this Agreement by any other
Equityholder. Except for fraud, criminal activity, gross negligence or
willful misconduct on its part, the Representative shall have no liability to
any other Equityholder under this Agreement for any act or omission by
the Representative on behalf of the other Equityholders.   

(d) _Retention of Counsel_. The Representative shall be entitled to retain
counsel and to incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Representative
deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement. The Representative shall incur no
liability to Equityholders with respect to any action taken, omitted or
suffered by them in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such
counsel. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Representative may
engage the Companys current counsel to represent the Representative in
matters relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and that
such representation would be adverse to the interests of the Surviving
Company. Buyer and the Company hereby waive any right that Buyer or the
Surviving Company might have in the future to object to any such
representation. The Representative shall be reimbursed for all such third
party fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs
and expenses) by the Escrow Expense Fund.   

(e) _Survival_. All of the immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement. The Equityholders other than JMI further agree
that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Equityholder.   

(f) _Limitation on the Buyer s Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, neither the Buyer nor the Surviving Company shall
be liable for any Loss to any Person, including any Equityholder, for any
action taken or not taken by the Representative or for any act or omission
taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken
or decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by the
Representative.   

(g) _Replacement of the Representative; Assignment_. The Representative may
be removed by action of those Equityholders representing eighty percent (80%)
of the Pro Rata Portion and such removal shall be effective upon written
notice to the Representative and the Buyer. If the Representative (i) is
removed by the Equityholders, (ii) dies or terminates its legal existence
(if not an individual), (iii) becomes legally incapacitated, or (iv) resigns
from its position as Representative, then the Equityholders representing a
majority of the Pro Rata Portion shall, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, appoint a replacement Representative, which
replacement Representative shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Such
appointment shall be effective upon delivery of at least two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to the Buyer and, thereafter, the replacement
Representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement. Any obligation of the Buyer to take any action in respect of
the Representative shall be suspended during any period that the position of
Representative is vacant. Any successor to the Representative shall succeed
the Representative as Representative hereunder, and all references to the
Representative in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such successor
from and after the appointment thereof. If for any reason there is no
Representative at any time, all references herein to the Representative shall
be deemed to refer to the Equityholders. No bond shall be required of the
Representative, and the Representative shall receive no compensation for
his services, other than reimbursement through the Escrow Expense Fund.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that
Updata Partners III, L.P. ("Updata") may (A) assign and delegate all of its
rights and obligations as Representative under this Agreement to an Affiliate
of Updata by providing written notice of such assignment and delegation to the
other parties hereto and/or (B) may deposit the Escrow Expense Fund with an
escrow or similar distribution agent selected by Updata or in a non-interest
bearing account, and in each case the costs and expenses associated therewith
(including any tax reporting) may be charged to the Escrow Expense
Fund.   

(h) _Access to Information_. The Representative and JMI shall have reasonable
access to information about Buyer and the Surviving Company and the
reasonable assistance of Buyer and the Surviving Companys officers and
employees for purposes of performing the Representatives duties and
exercising the Representatives and JMIs rights hereunder, provided that the
Representative and JMI shall (i) treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about Buyer and the Surviving Company to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to the Representatives retained advisors for
such matter who agree to treat such information confidentially), and (ii)
not have access to materials or information access to which by the
Representative or JMI could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
by the Company.   

(i) _Indemnity_. Each Equityholder other than JMI shall severally indemnify
and hold the Representative harmless from and against any loss, damage or
deficiencies (except as result from the Representatives gross negligence or
willful misconduct) that the Representative may suffer or incur in connection
with any action taken by the Representative, and each such Equityholder shall
bear its pro rata portion (based on such Equityholders Pro Rata Portion)
of such loss, damage or deficiency. The Representative shall be fully
protected by the Equityholders other than JMI in acting on and relying upon
any written notice, direction, request, waiver, notice, consent, receipt or
other paper or document which the Representative in good faith believes to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties.   

(j) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable attorneys fees, shall
be paid from the Expense Escrow Fund. Should the Expense Escrow Fund
be exhausted, all costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable attorneys fees, shall
be paid severally and on a pro rata basis (based on the Equityholders
Pro Rata Portions) by the Equityholders.   

11.14. _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the parties has been represented
by and has had an opportunity to consult legal counsel in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party by
any Governmental Authority by reason of such party having drafted or being
deemed to have drafted such provision   

11.15. _Buyer Guarantee_. Buyer, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due
and prompt payment by Merger Sub (LLC) and Merger Sub (Corp) of all monetary
obligations of Merger Sub (LLC) and Merger Sub (Corp) to the Equityholders
under this Agreement and the due and prompt performance of all
covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of Merger Sub (LLC) and
Merger Sub (Corp) under or in respect of this Agreement.
