ARTICLE 3 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON 
CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

 Section 3.1 _ Effect on Company Capital Stock._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.3) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.65882 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall 

    automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the
Effective Time, each Company Certificate, without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company or the holder of such share of Company Common Stock,
shall be deemed to represent that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Company Certificate by the Exchange Ratio. Each holder of
a Company Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, upon the surrender of any such
Company Certificates, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Company Certificate in accordance with Section 3.4 and cash in lieu of
fractional interests pursuant to Section 3.5.

  

 Section 3.2 _ Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holder of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 3.3 _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock, any Company Subsidiary, Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by third parties) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 Section 3.4 _ Exchange of Company Certificates._ 

  

 (a) Parent shall designate the Exchange Agent to act as agent for the holders of, and to receive in trust, the shares of Parent Common Stock and funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Article 3\. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of such shares the aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.1 (the "Exchange Fund"). 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Company Certificates, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock together with any dividends and other distributions with respect thereto and any cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be credited in street name through Depository Trust Company unless a physical certificate is specifically requested or is otherwise required by applicable Law) and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article 3, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. If certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be registered in the name of a Person or cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other 

     

 than the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable.

  

 (c) At the close of business on the day during which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. 

  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.5, until the surrender of such Company Certificate in accordance with this Article 3\. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.4(d) or 3.5) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Certificates, subject, however, to the obligation of the Surviving Corporation, if any, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

  

 Seciton 3.5 _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to Section 3.1 who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price. 

  

 Section 3.6 _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ At any time following six months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which has not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional interests in a share of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional interests in a share of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock 

     

 delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Company Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by
Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent, but any investment losses shall
not reduce the right of holders of shares to receive the consideration
specified in this Article 3\.

   

 Section 3.7 _ Certain Adjustments._ If between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or dividend. 

   

 Section 3.8 _ Company Options and Restricted Stock._ 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, together with all Company Stock Plans. Each assumed Company Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan and the applicable stock option agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to the consummation of the Merger, as specified by such terms and conditions), except that such assumed Company Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (b) The assumption of a Company Option by Parent shall not terminate or modify (except as required hereunder) any right of first refusal, right of repurchase, vesting schedule or other restriction on transferability relating to a Company Option or the stock issuable upon the exercise thereof. Continuous employment or service (in the case of a director or consultant) with the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be credited to an optionee for purposes of determining the number of shares subject to exercise, vesting or repurchase after the Effective Time, and the provisions in the applicable Company Stock Plan and stock option agreement evidencing the terms and conditions of any Company Option relating to the exercisability of any Company Option upon termination of an optionee\'s employment or service as a director shall not be deemed triggered until such time as such optionee shall be neither an employee or officer nor serving as a director of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. After such assumption, Parent shall issue, upon any partial or total exercise of any Company Option, in lieu of shares of Company Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock as described in Section 3.8(a). The assumption by Parent of Company Options shall not give holders of such Company Options any additional benefits which they did not have immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall not create any or other agreement for or right to employment. 

  

 (c) The Company shall terminate the Company ESPP in accordance with its terms, including without limitation, making all required notices and affording all required opportunities to purchase shares of Common Stock to participants, immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven days after the Effective Time), a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form (including a Form S-3 registration statement if required under applicable securities laws for former employees of the 

     

 Company who are not also former employees of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
assumed Company Options. The Company shall cooperate with Parent with the
preparation of such registration statement(s). Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make such amendments, if any, to the Company Stock Plans as shall be necessary to permit the assumption contemplated by this Section 3.8. It is the intention of the parties that (i) Company Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the same extent Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the assumption of Company Options provided by this Section 3.8 shall satisfy the conditions of Section 424(a) of the Code and (iii) the provisions of this Section 3.8 shall be applied consistent with this intent. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent. 

  

 (f) Except as may be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that all stock option plans established by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are not Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary are deleted, terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (g) All outstanding rights of the Company that it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase shares of Restricted Stock shall be assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to the consummation of the Merger, as specified by such terms and conditions), except that the shares purchasable, and purchase price, pursuant to the repurchase option shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (h) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Company Stock Plans or pursuant to the terms of any Company Option granted thereunder, each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of outstanding Company Options or Restricted Stock to the foregoing treatment of such Company Options or Restricted Stock. 

  

 Section 3.9 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates._ If any Company Certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 3.1, _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

      

    

  Section 3.10 _ Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of such
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.

  

 Section 3.11 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their corporation or otherwise to take, and will use good faith efforts to take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

No payment or benefit which may be required to be made by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or which otherwise may be required to be made under the terms of 

     

 any Parent Benefit Plan or other arrangement will constitute a parachute

 (ii) making such disclosure to Parent\'s stockholders as, in the good faith
judgment of the board of directors of Parent, pursuant to advice from outside
counsel, is required under applicable law; _provided_ , that Parent may not,
except as permitted by Section 6.6(c), withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend any Parent Competing
Transaction, or enter into any agreement with respect to any Parent
Competing Transaction. Upon execution of this Agreement, Parent will
immediately cease (and not resume) any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by Parent\'s stockholders, Parent may furnish information concerning
its business, properties or assets to any corporation, partnership, Person or
other entity or group pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements
(which shall be no more permissive than the Confidentiality Agreement and

negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such entity or
group concerning a Parent Competing Transaction if:

 (1)

 written opinion from Parent\'s investment banking firm that the Parent Competing Transaction is superior, from a financial point of view, to the Merger, and  


(2)

 written advice from independent legal counsel to Parent that the failure to provide such information or access or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be likely to cause the board of directors of Parent to violate its fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders under applicable law.

The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will disclose that three of the seven members of the board of directors of Parent will resign at the Effective Time and shall be replaced by three designees of the Company immediately after the Effective Time, as contemplated by Section 6.9 of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the assumption of Company Options, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent without the Company\'s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and without providing the Company the opportunity to review and comment thereon; _provided_ that with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations; and _provided further_ that the Company, in connection with a change in the recommendation of its board of directors, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any filing pursuant to this Section 6.13 or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any filing pursuant to this Section 6.13. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 6.13 to comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent will advise the Company promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the share of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

Parent shall ensure that the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Parent in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the DGCL, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent, the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and all other applicable legal requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.13(c) shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Parent of any Parent Superior Proposal or a Change in Parent Recommendation.

 Section 9.7 _ Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to and shall, subject to the discretion of 

     

 such court, reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid,
void or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

   

 Section 9.8 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including Section 5-1401 of New York General Obligations Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger shall be governed by Delaware Law. 

  

 Section 9.9 _ Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
