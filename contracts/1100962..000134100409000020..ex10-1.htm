WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, Parent

time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the \'\'Offer\'\') to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock ") at a price per share of
Company Common Stock of (1) $4.50, net to the seller in cash, without
interest, (2) the contractual right to receive one or more Nebido Contingent
Cash Consideration Payments (as defined in Section 9.14(v)) and (3) the
contractual right to receive an Octreotide Contingent Cash Consideration
Payment (as defined in Section 9.14(x)) (the aggregate consideration referred
to in (1), (2) and (3), or any other consideration per share paid pursuant to
the Offer, the ("Offer Price"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), pursuant to which each share of Company Common Stock, other than
(i) shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
3.3), will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(as defined in Section 3.1(a));

 



 

WHEREAS the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) adopted and approved this
Agreement and determined the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interest of the
stockholders of the Company and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared it
advisable for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement providing for the Offer
and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has approved this Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have entered into an agreement with each of Glenn L.
Cooper, M.D., Michael W. Rogers, Noah D. Beerman, Mark S. Butler, Bobby W.
Sandage, Jr. Ph.D, Malcolm Morville, Ph.D, and Sanders Morris Harris,
pursuant to which each of them has irrevocably agreed to tender the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such executive officer or director
in the Offer (constituting, in the aggregate, approximately 4.7% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the
"Stockholder Tender Agreements,") and together with (i) the Nebido Contingent
Cash Consideration Payment Agreement and the Octreotide Contingent Cash
Consideration Agreement and (ii) this Agreement, collectively referred to as
the "Transaction Agreements");

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

 

THE OFFER

 

 

Section 1.1 The Offer.

 

 

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than five business days) after the date of
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; provided, that the Company agrees
that no shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. The obligations of Merger
Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay
for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (as they may be amended
in accordance with this Agreement, the "Offer Conditions").

 

 

(i) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City
time, on the 45th calendar day following the commencement of the
Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act).
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time, to, in its
sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify
the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change,
modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit A), (iv)
add to the Offer Conditions, or (v) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner
adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and without
limiting Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s obligations under this
Section 1.1(a)(ii), Merger Sub (A) may, in its sole discretion, without
consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for any
period, if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the
Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or, in Merger Sub\'s sole discretion,
waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or
waived and (B) shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Stock Market
(the "Nasdaq") applicable to the Offer, and until any waiting period (and
any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act") and any other applicable foreign antitrust, competition
or similar Law shall have expired or been terminated; provided, however, that
in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer (1) beyond the
Outside Date (as defined in Section 8.1(b)(i)) or (2) at any time that Parent
or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE
VIII.

 

 

(iii) Parent and Merger Sub agree that if on any scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied but all of the other
Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A are satisfied or, in Merger Sub\'s
sole discretion, waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for a ten calendar day period;
provided, however, that this provision shall not require Merger Sub to extend
the expiration of the Offer more than one time, and in no event shall Merger
Sub be required to extend the Offer (1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any
time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII.

 

 

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject
to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a)). Acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Offer Closing", and the date on which the
Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing
Date". Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion,
following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer
Documents (as defined below) may, in Merger Sub\'s sole discretion, provide
for such a reservation of right. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(a)
shall affect any termination rights in ARTICLE VIII.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"), which shall contain an offer
to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other appropriate ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as
and to the extent required by Federal securities laws. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as soon as
reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence and
summaries of all material oral communications between them and their
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to
the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration
to any such comments. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub receives any
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly to
such comments and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues
raised therein.

 

 

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and
pay for, pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of
Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub or the paying agent for the Offer (the "Paying
Agent") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable
Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent to the
appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent.

4

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Contingent Cash
Consideration Agreements and represents that the Board of Directors, at a

Consideration Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders;

 

 

(ii) adopted this Agreement and approved the transactions hereby;

 

 

(iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, if required,

similar statute or regulation ("Takeover Statute").

 

 

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing, subject to Section
6.5(b), the recommendation described in Section 1.2(a)(iii) and shall mail the
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company as required by Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable
and as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence and summaries of all material oral communications between the
Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or
response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the Company contained in the Schedule 14D-9.
In the event that the Company receives any comments from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) respond promptly to such comments and (ii) take all other actions
necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly (and no later than
the date hereof) with mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the latest practicable
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings
and computer files and all other information in the Company\'s possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub such information and assistance (including
periodically updated lists of stockholders, security position listings
and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the
Offer to holders of Company Common Stock.

 

 

Section 1.3 Directors.

 

 

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors that equals
the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors
(giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this
Section 1.3) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares outstanding, and
the Company shall cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to
the Board of Directors, including by increasing the number of directors
and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time,
the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute
the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A)
each committee of the Board of Directors and (B) as requested by Parent,
each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee
thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Board of Directors. 

 

 

(b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions necessary
to effect the appointment of Parent\'s designees, including mailing to
its stockholders information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section 1.3(b), which, unless Parent otherwise
elects, shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply
to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Company\'s obligations under
Section 1.3(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information.

 

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2(b)
hereof), the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who were not designated by Parent (the "Independent Directors") shall
be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on the part of
the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall
be required to authorize) any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Board of Directors, any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger
Sub and any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein for the benefit of the Company.

 

 

Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

 

 

(a) The Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option, for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the
"Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company up to the number of
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (including as
authorized and unissued shares, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any shares
of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) equal to
the number of shares that, when added to the number of shares owned by
Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one
share more than the number of shares (the "Requisite Short-Form Merger
Shares") entitled to cast 90% of all the votes entitled to be cast by
the holders of the Company Common Stock on the Merger after the issuance of
all shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, calculated on
a fully-diluted basis or, as may be elected by Parent, on a primary basis as
of immediately prior to the issuance of such shares (such shares to be issued
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "Top-Up Shares").

 

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole or in part at
any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (i)
the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, provided that Merger Sub shall own as of such time less than
the Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to
the extent (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares would require approval of
the Company\'s stockholders under Nasdaq Rule 4350, (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would
exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock
that are not already reserved for issuance or (iii) any other provision of
applicable laws or judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by
Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying
the number of such shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such
aggregate purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either
in the same form of consideration as the Offer Price or by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to such purchase price.

 

 

(c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable laws, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). In the event Merger Sub wishes
to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company at least
three business days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of Top-
Up Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option;
(ii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase
price; and (iii) the place and time for the closing of such purchase. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to
be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.
Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

 

 

 

ARTICLE II

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

Section 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving entity following the Merger
(sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"). The existence
of the Company shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as
the Surviving Corporation, it shall be governed by the DGCL.

 

 

Section 2.2 Closing; Effective Time.

 

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New
York 10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as
the "Closing Date."

 

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by making all other

extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At the

the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the cash portion of the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock. All cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, which at the Effective Time
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1 hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case
of Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of Certificates
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or
(ii) or receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1, and any Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person (as defined in Section 9.14(dd))
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such surrender.

 

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article III.

 

 

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article
III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration.

 

 

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time,
or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash or Contingent
Cash Consideration Payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 4.5), any such cash or
Contingent Consideration Cash Payments shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis provided
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
former stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time pursuant to this
Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this Article III shall promptly be paid
to Parent.

 

 

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

 

 

(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the
Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 3.1(a);
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262
unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose
their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common
Stock and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

Approval With Label Milestone Date (as defined in the Nebido Contingent Cash
Consideration Agreement) by such Paying Agent in accordance with the Nebido

Section 4.3 Authority.

 

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined below) if required
in connection with this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Offer and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Offer and the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the effect of general
principles of equity. If approval of the Company Stockholders is required
pursuant to the DGCL, the affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the

holders of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly
and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) determining that this Agreement is advisable and that the terms of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
and (iii) recommending that the Company\'s stockholders adopt
this Agreement. Such resolutions are sufficient to render the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement and the other
Contingent Cash Consideration Agreements, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company,
no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or
purports to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the

Section 4.14 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

(a) Section 4.14(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as
of the date hereof, of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to individually as a
"Company Pension Plan" and collectively as the "Company Pension Plans"), all
"employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) (sometimes referred to individually as a "Company Welfare Plan" and
collectively as the "Company Welfare Plans"), and each vacation or paid time
off, severance, termination, retention, change in control, employment,
incentive compensation, performance, profit sharing, stock-based, stock-
related, stock option, fringe benefit, perquisite, stock purchase, stock
ownership, phantom stock and deferred compensation plan, arrangement,
agreement and understanding and other compensation, benefit and fringe
benefit plans, arrangements, agreements and understandings (whether or not
legally binding), sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any other Person that, together with the Company, is treated as
a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any
other applicable Law (each, a "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case,
providing benefits to any Company Participant, but not including the
Company Benefit Agreements (all such plans, arrangements, agreements and
understandings, including any such plan, arrangement, agreement or
understanding entered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into or adopted on or after the date of this Agreement, collectively,
"Company Benefit Plans"). Section 4.14(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list, as of the date hereof, of (i) each employment,
deferred compensation, change in control, severance, termination,
employee benefit, loan or indemnification agreement between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Company Participant, on the
other hand, and (ii) each contract between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Company Participant, on the other hand
(all such contracts under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), including any
contract which is entered into on or after the date of this Agreement,
collectively, "Company Benefit Agreements").

 

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (i)

summary of the material provisions of such plan or agreement) in effect on
the date hereof, (ii) the most recent report on Form 5500 filed with the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Company Benefit Plan in effect
on the date hereof, to the extent any such report was required by applicable
Law, (iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit

and (iv) each currently effective trust agreement or other funding vehicle

to sponsor, maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or contingent
liability under, any benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or is a
plan described in Section 3(40) of ERISA or Section 413 of the Code. With
respect to any Company Welfare Plan or any Company Benefit Agreement that is
an employee welfare benefit plan, (A) no such Company Welfare Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code), (B) each such Company Welfare Plan
and Company Benefit Agreement that is a "group health plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) materially complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and any applicable
similar state or local Law and (C) to the knowledge of the Company, each
such Company Welfare Plan and Company Benefit Agreement (including any such
plan or agreement covering retirees or other former employees) may be
amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary on or at any time after the Effective Time. No Company
Welfare Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that is an employee welfare benefit
plan as defined under ERISA Section 3(1) provides benefits to, or on behalf
of, any former employee after the termination of employment except (1) where
the full cost of such benefit is borne entirely by the former employee
(or his eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or (2) where the benefit is
required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 

 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company (i) each Company Benefit Plan and
Company Benefit Agreement has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and
the Code; (ii) all material contributions, including participant
contributions, and benefit payments required under each Company Benefit Plan
and Company Benefit Agreement have been made in full on a timely and proper
basis pursuant to the terms of such plan or agreement and applicable Law;
(iii) no Company Participant has received or is reasonably expected to
receive any payment or benefit from the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that would be nondeductible pursuant to Section

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

162(m) of the Code or any other applicable Law, except as otherwise set
forth in Section 4.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter; (iv) each
Company Pension Plan that is intended to comply with the provisions
of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service or an application therefor with respect
to all material and applicable Tax law changes to the effect that such
Company Pension Plan currently is qualified and exempt from income
Taxes under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust relating to such plan is
exempt from income Taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such determination letter has been revoked and,
to the knowledge of the Company, revocation has not been threatened, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the
most recent determination letter or application therefor relating to any
such Company Pension Plan that is reasonably expected to affect the
qualification of such Company Pension Plan adversely or materially increase
the costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of
ERISA; (v) the Company has made available to Parent a copy of the most
recent determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension
Plan for which such a letter has been issued, as well as a copy of any
pending application for a determination letter and a complete and accurate
list of all amendments to any Company Pension Plan in effect as of the date
hereof as to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been
received; (vi) there are no understandings, agreements or undertakings,
written or oral, with any Person (other than pursuant to the express terms
of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement) that are
(pursuant to any such understandings, agreements or undertakings) reasonably
expected to result in any material liabilities if such Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement were amended or terminated upon or at any time
after the Effective Time or that would prevent any unilateral action by the
Company (or, after the Effective Time, Parent) to effect such amendment or
termination; (vii) only officers, directors and employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries are eligible for compensation or benefits under the
terms of each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreements, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, each individual who is classified by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as an "employee" or as an "independent
contractor" is properly so classified; and (viii) except as set forth in
Section 4.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter or Section 4.14(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding any oral or written representation
to the contrary, no Company Participant is entitled to any gross-up, make-
whole or other additional payment from the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in respect of any Tax (including Federal, state, local or foreign income,
excise or other Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Section 409A of the
Code)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

 

 

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Benefit Plan and each
Company Benefit Agreement for the benefit of any employee, officer or
director of the Company that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a
"Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") subject to Section 409A of the
Code has been operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the
Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of (i) Section 409A of the Code and (ii)(A) the
Final Regulations issued thereunder or (B) Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-1 (clauses (i) and (ii), together, the "409A Authorities"), and the
Company has used its reasonable best efforts to amend each
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan to the extent required to comply
with Section 409A and the Final Regulations issued thereunder.

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted, assigned or otherwise
transferred to any Person any right, title or interest in or to any Product
or Product IP.

knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any Litigation regarding any
of the foregoing in (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4) or (A)(5); no Company IP
has been or is being used or enforced by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or, with respect to any or all of the Product IP, by any of
their licensors, in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to result in the cancellation, invalidity or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

case may be, or which would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of
any of the conditions set forth in Annex A to be satisfied. Notwithstanding
the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3 will not
limit or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties, the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice or the conditions to such party\'s obligation to
consummate the Offer or the Merger.

 

 

(b) The Company: (i) shall keep Parent promptly informed of (A) any
communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMEA and any other
Regulatory Authority and (B) any material communications (written or
oral) received from any Person relating to the Company IP and (ii) shall not
make any submissions to, or have discussions with, the FDA, EMEA and any
other Regulatory Authority without prior disclosure to Parent of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

details of such communications or submissions. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a periodic basis of any material communications from the FDA,
EMEA, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council (UK)
and any other Regulatory Authority relating to any of the Products.

 

 

Section 6.4 Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all other
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices with other Governmental Entities under Competition Laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. "Competition Laws" mean the HSR Act,
the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for
additional information made by the United States Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Entities, and act in good faith and reasonably cooperate
with the other party in connection with any investigation of any Governmental
Entity. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each
other all information required for any filing, form, declaration,
notification, registration and notice. Each party shall give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and
permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed communication,
understanding or agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement. None of the parties shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings or
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting and,
unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. The parties will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any information or proposals submitted in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts: (i) to avoid the entry of any judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing; (ii) to eliminate every impediment under
any Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date (as defined herein)); and (iii) vigorously to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any
administrative or judicial action.

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Entities and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the making of all other necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities, if any), (ii) the obtaining of all
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required in
connection with the Offer or the Merger that are necessary to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any other documents that may
be required to be filed with the SEC, (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement, and (v) the providing of all such information concerning such
party, its subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its subsidiaries\' and
Affiliates\' officers, directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in Section 6.4(a)
or this Section 6.4(b). Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Offer Closing
each of the consents that are listed in Section 6.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any
other action or agree to any limitation or restriction.

 

 

Section 6.5 No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation.

 

 

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
the Company Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action
designed to, or which is reasonably expected to, facilitate, any Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to,
any Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, in
response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company
Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal
was not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.5(a), the Company
may, if a majority of the Company Board determines (after consultation with
outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, and subject to compliance with this Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(c)
and after giving Parent written notice of such determination, (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall
include a customary "standstill" or similar covenant) not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement and containing provisions allowing necessary disclosures to Parent
pursuant to Section 6.5(c) hereof; provided that (1) all such information
has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to the
time it is provided to such Person and (2) such customary
confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for the Company to
comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.5(b) and Section
6.5(c), and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.5(a) by any Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5(a) by
the Company.

 

 

The term "Company Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of any Product or of assets or businesses that constitute 15%
or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest
expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pursuant to which any Person or the stockholders of any
Person would own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or of any resulting parent company of the Company,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

The term "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal
(provided, that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in the
definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
50%) which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from
a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account
all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and the Offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i) (A)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare
advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change")
or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.5(a) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set
forth therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to Offer
Closing Date, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if a majority of the Company Board determines (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that no such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth calendar day
following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (a "Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that (x)
any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal or (y) with
respect to any previous Company Adverse Recommendation Change, any material
change in the principal stated rationale by the Company Board for
such previous Company Adverse Recommendation Change, shall, in the case
of either (x) or (y), require a new Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation
and a new five (5) calendar day-period). In determining whether to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to a Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

 

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.5(a)
and Section 6.5(b), (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry that is reasonably expected to lead to any
Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry
and (ii) the Company shall (A) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the
status and material details (including any change to any material term
thereof) of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to
Parent promptly after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
In addition, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Offer Closing, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive
any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. During such period, the Company shall enforce, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court of the United States of America or of any state having
jurisdiction.

 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14(e)-2(a)
or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders (including, without limitation,
any amendments to its Schedule 14D-9 relating to a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company Adverse Change Recommendation) if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that
all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or the Company Board
or any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 6.5(a).

 

 

Section 6.6 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parent\'s expense) in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its
directors relating to the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that
Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not
include full release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

 

 

Section 6.7 Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance. For not less
than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-
Laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any directors, officers or employees of the Company for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless such Persons to the fullest extent permitted by law for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not
less than six years from the Effective Time, the Company\'s current directors
and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that
is no less favorable than the Company\'s existing policy or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250 percent of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; provided that
Parent may substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to
DandO Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance.

 

 

Section 6.8 Public Announcements. The initial press release shall be a
joint press release and thereafter, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the Offer Closing and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company and Parent each
shall obtain the prior consent of the other prior to issuing any press
releases or making other public statements and communications with respect to
the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
Products, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of Nasdaq. In addition, the Company and
Parent shall develop a joint communications strategy and each party shall
ensure that, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Offer Closing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, all
press releases and other public statements and communications (including any
communications that would require a filing under Rules 14d-2 or 14d-9 of the
Exchange Act), with analysts, members of the financial community or
otherwise, with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or Products shall be consistent in all
material respects with such joint communications strategy.

 

 

Section 6.9 Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders\' Meeting.

 

 

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is
required by the DGCL, as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing,
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review,
comment and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholder
Approval (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the "Proxy Statement"). The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as
promptly as practicable after clearing comments received from the SEC.
No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be
made by the Company without Parent\'s prior consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and without providing Parent the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company will
advise Parent promptly of any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become known to Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement necessary
so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at
the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, the Proxy Statement shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

 

(c) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is
required by the DGCL, the Company shall take all action necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the approval by
the Company\'s stockholders in accordance with the DGCL (the
"Company Stockholders\' Meeting"). The Company shall ensure that the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited
in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of Nasdaq and the Company
Organizational Documents.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any subsequent
offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Offer Closing without the Company Stockholder\'s Meeting in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

 

Section 6.10 Employees.

 

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to employ those
individuals set forth on Section 6.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the "Nebido Transition Team") from the Offer Closing
until at least the earliest of (i) the Approval With Label Milestone Date
(as defined in the Nebido Contingent Cash Consideration Agreement), the
(ii) Approval Without Label Milestone Date (as defined in the
Nebido Contingent Cash Consideration Agreement, (iii) December 31, 2009 (the
"Nebido Transition Team Employment Period") and (iv) with respect to any
member of the Nebido Transition Team, such member\'s death, disability or
voluntary termination of employment. During the Nebido Transition Team
Employment Period, the management structure and reporting lines of the Nebido
Transition Team shall be as set forth on Section 6.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Upon the Approval with Label Milestone Date or Approval
Without Label Milestone Date, provided that such date occurs on or prior to
December 31, 2009, each member of the Nebido Transition Team who is then
employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be provided with a cash
bonus in the amount set forth beside his or her name on Section 6.10(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) For a period of one year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Covered Employees") who remain employed
during such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding
equity based compensation) which, taken as a whole, have a
value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefits provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in
such case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered Employees
who remain employed during such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respective Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits that, taken as
a whole, have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
Covered Employees than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries. In addition, except as set forth in Section
6.10(a), for a period of one year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Covered Employees whose
employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with severance benefits in accordance with such employee\'s individual
employment agreement or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance
with the severance policy of Parent in effect from time to time. Effective
not later than the Closing Date, Parent will establish a retention program
for those Company employees Parent determines to seek to retain. Parent shall
have no obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the
effect of requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

 

 

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall
receive service credit for service with the Company (and with any predecessor
or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company granted
service credit) as if such service had been completed with Parent; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 

 

(d) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or
use reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any
pre-existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to
any Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health
or welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (a "New Plan") in which such Covered Employee or
covered dependent shall become eligible to participate after the
Effective Time to the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was
no longer subject to such pre-existing condition limitation under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee or such
covered dependent was participating immediately before he or she became
eligible to participate in the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each
Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time and during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs under any Company Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-
payment and deductible requirements for such calendar year under any New Plan
in which such Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time.

 

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall confer any rights or remedies of any
kind or description upon any Covered Employee or any other Person other than
the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns or be
construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement.

 

 

(f) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall refrain from causing any
employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to suffer an "employment
loss" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 or any similar state or local law (collectively, the "WARN Act"), in
the ninety-one (91) days prior to the Offer Closing, without the prior consent
of Parent. Notwithstanding Section 6.8 of this Agreement, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cooperate with
and provide reasonable assistance to Parent or its agents in preparing
and delivering any notices required or potentially required pursuant to the
WARN Act (as determined by Parent in its sole discretion) to effectuate the
termination of the employment of any employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time in compliance with the WARN Act;
provided, however, that all such notices shall indicate that the terminations
of employment are contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

 

Section 6.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such efforts to include all steps
required be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12,
1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

 

 

Section 6.12 Development Drugs. From and after the Offer Closing, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, in the ordinary course,
each of Nebido and Octreotide; provided, that, with respect to (i)
Nebido, Parent\'s obligations under this Section 6.12 shall terminate on the
third anniversary of the Offer Closing and (ii) with respect
Octreotide, Parent\'s obligations under this Section 6.12 shall terminate on
the fourth anniversary of the Offer Closing. For the purposes of this
Section 6.12, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall mean efforts and
resources normally used by Parent for a product owned by it or to which it
has exclusive rights, which is of similar market potential at a similar stage
in its development or product life, taking into account issues of safety and
efficacy, product profile, competitiveness of the marketplace, the
proprietary position of the compound or product, the regulatory and
reimbursement structure involved, the profitability of the applicable
products, and other relevant factors.

 

 

Section 6.13 State Takeover Laws. If any state takeover Law becomes
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

 

Section 6.14 Contingent Stock Rights. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall:

 

 

(a) pursuant to the Stent Contingent Stock Rights Agreement, dated as of
April 17, 2007, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (the "Stent Contingent Stock Rights Agreement"), execute and
deliver to the Rights Agent thereunder a supplemental contingent stock rights
agreement, providing that Parent shall (i) provide such cash and Contingent
Cash Consideration Payments as any Holder (as defined in the Stent
Contingent Stock Rights Agreement) would be entitled in accordance with the
terms of the Stent Contingent Stock Rights Agreement upon the occurrence of

Event underlying such termination is not an act of God, natural disaster, war

rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts
