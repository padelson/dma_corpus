analysis of data and information whether or not in electronic format, used in
the conduct of Companys or its Subsidiaries respective businesses
(collectively, the " _IT Systems_ ") have been properly maintained by
technically competent personnel, in accordance with standards set by the
manufacturers or otherwise in accordance with standards prudent in the
industry to ensure proper operation, monitoring and use. The IT Systems are in
reasonable working condition capable of reasonably performing all material
information technology operations used in the conduct of Companys or its
Subsidiaries respective businesses. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have experienced within the past twenty-four (24) months any
material disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of the

against unauthorized access to the IT Systems or Company Data. To the

have complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws pertaining to
data privacy regarding the Company Data. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement (or any of the ancillary agreements) nor the
consummation of any of the Sections (or any of the ancillary agreements) will
result in a material violation of any Laws pertaining to data privacy or
Company Data. For avoidance of doubt, all Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for

programs or arrangements (whether written or unwritten), including any equity
plans, written employment agreements, written consulting agreements, severance
pay policies, or material fringe benefits (the " _Plans_ "). No Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA. Each of the Plans that is intended to be

amended (the " _Code_ "), has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or may rely on a

(b) The Employee Benefits Schedule lists each Plan maintained outside the
jurisdiction of the United States, or that covers any employee residing or

established, maintained and

 



      
 

 



 

administered in material compliance with their terms and all applicable
statutes, Laws, ordinances, rules, orders, decrees, judgments, writs, and
regulations of any controlling Governmental Entity or instrumentality. All
Foreign Plans that are required to be funded are funded in accordance with
such requirements in all material respects, and with respect to all other
Foreign Plans, adequate reserves therefor have been established or liabilities
have been accrued on the Latest Balance Sheet. No material liability or
obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries exists with respect to any
Foreign Plans other than the benefits provided under such Foreign Plans and
applicable administrative expenses. Each Plan that is required to be
registered under the Laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States has been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate
regulatory authorities and Governmental Entities. Any increases to benefits
under a Foreign Plan that are required under applicable Laws have been made as

States Law.

hearing or claim with respect to the assets thereof (other than routine claims

writing that could reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
the Company. There are no audits, inquiries or Proceedings pending or
threatened in writing or, to the Companys knowledge, otherwise threatened by
the IRS, Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any Plan. Except as would not be expected to result in material liability to
the Company, the Company has not incurred any penalty or Tax with respect to
any Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the
Code. Except as would not be expected to result in material liability to the
Company, the Company has made all contributions and other payments required by
and due under the terms of each Plan.

severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any Person.

 



 

(j) Each Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to
Section 409A of the Code has been administered, operated and maintained in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the

(xxvii) enter into any agreement or transaction that is not in the ordinary
course of business that would result in the Company or any Subsidiary
realizing

be in excess of any cash or cash equivalents received by the Company or any
Subsidiary in respect of such income within three (3) months after the date

6.02 _Access_.

 



 

(a) _Books_ and _Records_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, subject to _Section 7.01_, the Company
shall provide Buyer and its authorized representatives (" _Buyer s
Representatives_") with commercially reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, personnel, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order for Buyer to effect a
smooth transition of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) nothing herein
shall require the Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information
to, Buyer or any of its representatives if such access or disclosure, in the
good faith reasonable belief of the Company, (x) would waive any legal
privilege or (y) would be in violation of applicable laws or regulations of
any Governmental Entity (including competition laws) or the provisions of any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party. Buyer is
not authorized to and shall not (and shall cause its Buyers Representatives
and Affiliates not to) contact any officer, employee, independent contractor,
customer, supplier, consultant or any other material business relation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing with respect to any
matter arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (as provided by Kraig McEwen).
Buyer acknowledges that it remains bound by the Non-Disclosure Agreement,
dated December 3, 2013, by and between Omnicell, Inc. and Francisco Partners
III, L.P., for the benefit of the Company (as amended or supplemented through
the date of this Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ that Buyer and Buyers Representatives may provide the Required
Information and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to

 



      
 

 



 

Financing Sources under customary confidentiality terms and agreements and may
file or furnish the Required Information in filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission to the extent required or appropriate in connection
with the Debt Financing or other financing transaction, whether as a result of
the operation of Regulation S-X, to comply with obligations under Regulation
FD under the Securities Act or otherwise. Except as set forth in the proviso
to the prior sentence, all information provided or obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby will be held by Buyer in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
automatically, without any action by any party, upon the Closing. In the event
of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms hereof and the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms hereof will govern.

 



 

(b) _Financial Information; Litigation_. Without limiting generality of the
foregoing, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof
until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause the respective
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to: (A) provide Buyer and
Buyer Representatives with such copies of the books, records, Tax Returns,
work papers and other documents and information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and with such additional financial, operating and other data
and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Buyer may
reasonably request; (B) permit Buyer Representatives to meet, upon reasonable
notice and during normal business hours, with the chief financial officer and
other officers and managers of the Company responsible for the Companys
financial statements and the internal controls of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to discuss such matters as Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or
appropriate in order to enable Buyer to satisfy its obligations under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations relating thereto or otherwise
in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement; and (C)
(x) keep legal counsel selected by Buyer, in its sole discretion, informed,
following Buyers reasonable request, of any developments with respect to any
of the matters set forth on the Litigation Schedule and (y) for any Proceeding
not set forth on the Litigation Schedule, permit legal counsel selected by
Buyer, in its sole discretion, to participate in discussions regarding the
defense of any such material Proceeding, including discussions of matters of
strategy and tactics. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof until the
Closing Date, Company shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of:

 



 

(i) any audited year-end financial statements, which shall be provided by the
Company to Buyer as soon as they become available;

 



 

(ii) a monthly booking forecast, expenditures report and cash balances report,
which shall be delivered by the Company to Buyer within ten days after the end
of such calendar month, in each case, in the format agreed to by the Company
and Buyer;

 



 

(iii) the unaudited quarterly consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
the end of each fiscal quarter and the related unaudited quarterly
consolidated statements of operations, and statements of cash flows for such
fiscal quarter, as well as a quarterly revenue forecast, all of which shall be
delivered by the Company to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the end of
such fiscal quarter; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) any material, non-privileged notice, document or other communication sent
by or on behalf of, or sent to, any of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
relating to any Proceeding threatened in writing against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement, except for Proceedings in which
the amount in controversy is not likely to exceed $50,000.

 



 

6.03 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_, the Sellers and the Company shall ensure that none of the
Sellers, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries or their respective
employees, officers, directors, investors, affiliates, agents or authorized
representatives (including, without limitation, Francisco Partners) directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations or
enter into an agreement with, provide any information to, or otherwise
encourage any Person (other than Buyer, Buyers Representatives and the
Financing Sources) concerning any purchase and sale of all or substantially
all of the Company Interests, any merger involving the Company, any purchase
and sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any similar transaction involving the Company (other than
sales of assets in the ordinary course of business).

 



 

6.04 _Consents_. The Company shall, prior to the Closing, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals or waivers and deliver
any notices required to be made and obtained, including those listed on the
Authorization Schedule, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to any applicable law or
contract, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the mere failure to
obtain any actions, consents, approvals or waivers required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement and (b) all
obligations of Buyer, Sellers and the Company relating to the Debt Financing
shall be governed exclusively by _Section 6.05 and Section 6.06_, and not
this _Section 6.04_.

 



 

6.05 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the proceeds of the Debt
Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter into Financing Agreements with respect
thereto, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent to the
obligations of the Financing Sources applicable to, and within the control of
Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (v) in the event all conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letter and all conditions precedent hereunder to Buyers
obligations in _Section 2.02_ have been satisfied, cause the Financing
Sources to consummate and fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that it complies with any minimum liquidity
or similar conditions precedent included in the Debt Commitment, to the extent
that such compliance is required by the Financing Sources as a condition to
the Debt Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.05(c)_, Buyer shall not agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such amendments, modifications or
waivers would impose new or additional conditions precedent or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent in a manner adverse to
Buyer, Sellers or the Company, in each case, solely to the extent that such
amendment or modification would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or delay
or impair the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights or
remedies against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing
Agreements or (C) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing any
less likely to occur.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity financing for
all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources so long as such
substitute financing is subject to funding conditions that are not less
favorable to Buyer than the funding conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and so long as such substitute financing would not adversely
impact the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
on a timely basis.

 



 

(d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreements, (i) Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within three
(3) Business Days) so notify the Company in writing and (ii) Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the
same or alternative financial institutions in an amount (after taking into
consideration the funds otherwise expected to be available to Buyer) equal to
the lesser of (x) an aggregate amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) the amount of financing that was
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any fees, premiums and
expenses payable in connection therewith) on the date of this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to obtain, negotiate or enter
into any Financing Agreements with respect to any Debt Financing on terms and
conditions that are materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than
those in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any flex provisions).
The definitive agreements entered into in connection with any Debt Financing
or Alternative Financing, as applicable, are referred to in this Agreement,
collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." In the event any alternative
or substitute debt financing (an " _Alternative Financing_ ") is obtained in
accordance with _Section 6.05(c)_ or this _Section 6.05(d)_, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the financing
contemplated by such Alternative Financing as permitted to be modified
pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, and (B) if a new financing commitment letter
is entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing (the " _New
Commitment Letter_ "), references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment
Letter (except for purposes of _Section 4.08_) shall be deemed to include the
New Commitment Letter and any other Debt Commitment Letter(s) that are not
superseded by the New Commitment Letter at the time in question.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Buyer shall (i) furnish the Company complete and correct copies of the
Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement entered into in
accordance with this _Section 6.05_ promptly upon their execution (provided
that any Fee Letter may be redacted with respect to fees and other provisions
that do not affect the conditionality of the applicable Debt Financing), (ii)
give the Company prompt (and in any case within two (2) Business Days) written
notice of any breach or threatened breach of which Buyer is or becomes aware
by any party of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements
or any termination or threatened termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep
the Company reasonably informed in a timely manner of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 



 

6.06 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their representatives to, and provide to Buyer such customary and necessary
cooperation, at Buyers sole expense, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
to assist Buyer in causing the conditions in each Debt Commitment Letter to be
satisfied and such customary cooperation as is otherwise reasonably necessary
and reasonably requested by Buyer solely in connection with obtaining the Debt
Financing (and any Alternative Financing), which cooperation shall include
(without limiting the generality of the foregoing):

 



 

(i) upon reasonable advance notice, causing its management team, external
auditors and other non-legal advisors to assist in preparation for and to

marketing and syndication thereof;

 



 

(iv) subject to _Section 6.02_, furnishing Buyer and its Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable with (A) information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably available to the Company (including

regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries) customarily delivered by a
borrower for the arrangement of loans contemplated by the Debt Financing, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer to assist in preparation of customary
rating agency or lender or investor presentations relating to such arrangement
of loans (the " _Required Information_ "), _provided_ _that_ the only
financial statements that shall be required as part of the Required
Information shall be the audited financial statements contemplated in _Section
6.06(a)(iv)(B)(1)_ below and any unaudited

 



      
 

 



 

financial statements required to be delivered as of any applicable date
pursuant to _Section 6.06(a)(iv)(B)(2)_ below, and (B) all reasonably

Commitment Letter or necessary for the preparation of customary offering
memoranda contemplated by the Debt Financing, including (1) the audited
consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of income,
members equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the

furnished upon completion thereof), and (2) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and related consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the six months ended September 30, 2015 and
for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter after the date of the most recent

the preceding fiscal year;

 



 

(v) executing and delivering any customary pledge, guaranty and collateral
documents, ancillary document and instruments and customary closing
certificates, preparing and delivering of original stock certificates and
original stock powers and other instruments (together with appropriate powers
relating thereto) to the Financing Sources on the Closing Date (to the extent
required in connection with the Debt Financing) and assisting in preparing
schedules to any credit agreement, security agreements and other documents in
connection with the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer;

 



 

(vi) delivery to Buyer and the Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably
practicable of (A) the documentation and other information requested by the
Financing Sources with respect to (x) applicable "know-your-customer" and

the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and, in any event, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date);

 



 

(vii) using reasonable best efforts (including by providing customary
representations to such accountants) to cause accountants to consent to the
use of their reports in any material relating to the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(viii) providing Buyer prompt notice of any Required Information ceasing to be
Compliant.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 6.06_): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Section 6.06_) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it
would (A) require the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives, as applicable, to waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees
or reimburse any expenses that are not contingent upon the Closing or incur
any liability or give any indemnities that are not contingent upon the
Closing, (B) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
the Sellers, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, (C) require the
Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to take any action
that will conflict with or violate the applicable partys Organizational
Documents, any Laws or the Credit Agreement or result in the contravention of,
or that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or
default under, any Material Contract, (D) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any financing or purchase agreement for
the Debt Financing prior to the Closing, or (E) result in the Sellers, the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries incurring any liability with
respect to any agreements or matters relating to the Debt Financing prior to
the Closing (other than with respect to customary letters referred to above);
(ii) no action, liability or obligation (including any obligation to pay any
commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses) of the Company or any of

certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the

effective until (or that is not contingent upon) the Closing; and (iii) none
of the Sellers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of
their respective representatives shall have any liability or incur any losses,

the event the Closing does not occur.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries
trademarks in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such
trademarks are used solely in conformance with the Companys trademark usage
guidelines and all such uses are in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
goodwill associated with such uses shall inure to the sole benefit of the
Company.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Companys or any of its Affiliates

subject to Buyers prior approval of a statement of work and budget. Subject
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the 2014-2015 Audit as promptly as reasonably
practicable. In the event that the 2014-2015 Audit is completed prior to the
date the Closing is to occur, the Company shall deliver to Buyer the 2014-2015
Audit upon completion thereof, it being understood and agreed that neither the
completion of the 2014-2015 Audit nor the delivery of the 2014-2015 Audit is a
condition to the Closing.

 



 

6.08 _Section 280G of the Code_. Prior to the Closing Date, Aesynt Holdings,
Inc. shall seek a vote of the Sellers (to the extent and in the manner
required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) as to whether any "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) who, in the absence of
shareholder approval satisfying the requirements of Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii)
and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, would receive payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, has a
right to receive such payments. Prior to such vote, Aesynt Holdings, Inc.
shall obtain waivers from such individuals in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer, such that unless such payments are approved by the Sellers to the
extent and in the manner required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, no such payments shall be made. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Closing shall not be conditioned on Aesynt Holdings, Inc.
receiving such shareholder approval for any such payments. Sellers agree that
in the absence of such shareholder approval, no parachute payments shall be
made to any disqualified individual. The form and substance of all documents
contemplated by this Section 6.08, including the waivers, shall be subject to
the prior review and reasonable approval of Buyer.

 



 

ARTICLE VII

 



 

 _CERTAIN COVENANTS OF BUYER AND SELLERS_

 



 

7.01 _Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
Buyer and Buyers Representatives shall not contact or otherwise communicate
with the employees, independent contractors, customers, suppliers, consultants
and other material business relations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 



 

7.02 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide the Sellers and
their authorized representatives with access at all reasonable times to the
offices, properties, personnel and books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by the Sellers for periods prior to the
Closing Date in connection with any Tax matter whether or not relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business operations of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

and its Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise consented to by the Sellers, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Buyer shall
not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any
material books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date and that would be
required to be retained for purposes of compliance with applicable Tax Laws
without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Sellers and offering to
surrender to the Sellers such books and records or such portions thereof.

 



 

7.03 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
modify any provision in their respective Organizational Documents as now in
effect relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers,
managing members, managers, directors or equivalent Persons (unless required
by law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers, managing
members, managers, directors and equivalent Persons of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the full extent of the law.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, take all necessary steps to acquire
and maintain a liability insurance policy (or acquire an equivalent tail-
policy) for the benefit of the Companys and its Subsidiaries and (to the
extent related to the Company and its Subsidiaries) the Companys officers,
managing members, managers, directors or equivalent Persons with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to or in connection
with the Closing, in each case, which policy shall have a term of or be
maintained for at least six (6) years following the Closing Date and terms
that are no less favorable than those under the Companys and its
Subsidiaries existing officers, managing members, managers, directors and
equivalent Persons liability insurance policy; _provided_ _that_ , in
satisfying their obligations under this _Section 7.03(b)_, Buyer and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year
(the " _Premium Limit_ "), which amount the Company has disclosed to Buyer
prior to the date hereof, but nonetheless shall be obligated to maintain the
maximum amount of liability insurance coverage available for the Premium
Limit.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement between the Company and any individual who at
the Closing is, or at any time prior to the Closing was, a managing member,
manager, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (to the extent related to the Company and its Subsidiaries)
the Company and (ii) any indemnification provision (including advancement of
expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. Buyers and the Companys and its Subsidiaries
obligations under the preceding sentence shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification,

 



      
 

 



 

exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim.

 



 

(d) In the event that Buyer, the Company, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as
the case may be, are obligated to honor the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.03_.

 



 

7.04 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Company shall provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date with (i) at least the same total cash compensation (taking into
account base pay and cash bonus opportunities, but excluding equity-based
benefits) as was in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all
other material employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those other employee benefits as were in effect immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement as provided to Buyer, except for any 401(k) plan
matching program of the Company or its Subsidiaries. In addition, Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide severance benefits to any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is terminated within
one (1) year after the Closing Date that are at least as favorable as those
that exist under the written severance plan, written severance policy or
written severance practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
execution of this Agreement as provided to Buyer (the " _Company Severance
Plan_ ").

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.04(a)_, except to the
extent any of the following would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to any employee benefit plans as may be maintained for employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries during the twelve- (12)-month period
following the Closing by Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
(including without limitation plans or policies providing vacation entitlement
or the Company Severance Plan, or any severance plan established following the
Closing providing severance benefits to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries), service by such employees performed for the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (or a predecessor to the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries business or assets) shall be treated as service with Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting. Such service
also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.04(a)_, Buyer shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their terms, and
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company) to, make
required payments when due under, all benefit plans maintained or contributed
to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (including without limitation employment, bonus,
incentive and severance agreements and arrangements), that are applicable with
respect to any

 



      
 

 



 

employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or
their beneficiaries.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Buyer, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any Person any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment or (iv) is intended to confer
upon any Person any other rights right as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) If requested by Buyer in writing (including by email), the Company shall
adopt board resolutions, in a form acceptable to Buyer, to terminate any
401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective as of immediately prior to the Closing. If
such termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan is required by Buyer pursuant to
the preceding sentence, prior to the Closing, the Company shall have provided
Buyer with evidence satisfactory to Buyer that the board of directors of the
Company has adopted such resolutions regarding the termination of the
Companys 401(k) Plan effective immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

7.05 _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. For a period of ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor the Company shall terminate any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such numbers as would
trigger any liability under the Worker Adjustment, Retraining and Notification
Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq. (" _WARN_ ") or any state plant closing or
severance law. Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply
with any notice or filing requirements under WARN and any state plant closing
or severance law.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII _ 
TERMINATION_

 



 

8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated in writing at any time
prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyer, the Sellers and the Company;

 



 

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by the Company
of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Buyer or, in the case of a covenant breach, cured by the Company
within fifteen (15) days after notice thereof to the Company from Buyer;

 



 

(c) by the Company, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer
of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of the Company at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by the Company or cured by Buyer within fifteen

 



      
 

 



 

(15) days after notice thereof to Buyer by the Company, as applicable;
_provided_ _that_ the failure of Buyer to deliver the consideration as
required pursuant to _Section 1.04_ shall not be subject to cure hereunder;

 



 

(d) by the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if (i) the
transactions contemplated hereby shall violate any writ, judgment, decree,
injunction or similar order of any court or Governmental Entity, in each case,
that shall have become final and nonappealable or (ii) there shall be any law,
statute, rule or regulation adopted or enacted by any Governmental Entity
after the date hereof which makes the transactions contemplated hereby illegal
or otherwise prohibited;

 



 

(e) by Buyer if the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department
of Justice imposes any Antitrust Restraint; or

 



 

(f) by Buyer or the Company, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated by October 29, 2016; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor the Company shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01_ if such
party is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

8.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Buyer or the Company as
provided above, the provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void
and of no further force and effect (other than this _Section 8.02,_ _Article
XII_ and the Confidentiality Agreement each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of
any of Buyer, the Company or the Sellers (or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors or members) to one another with respect to
such termination, except (i) to the extent provided in _Section 8.02(b)_ and
(ii) for any willful breaches of the covenants or agreements of this Agreement
or any other willful breaches of the representations or warranties contained
in _Article III_, _Article IV_ and _Article V_ of this Agreement at or
prior to the time of such termination.

 



 

(b) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Buyer or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_, (B) by Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.01(e)_, or (C) by the Company or Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_, and
(ii) at the time of such termination, (x) if this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer, each of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.02_ (other than
_Section 2.02(c)_) have been satisfied or waived (disregarding those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but which would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination), and (y) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company, each of
the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ (other than _Section 2.01(c)_)
have been satisfied or waived (disregarding those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but which would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), then Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers a non-refundable termination fee of $15,000,000 (the
" _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the Sellers, at the time of termination
in the case of a termination by Buyer, or within two (2) Business Days after
such termination in the case of a termination by the Company, it being

 



      
 

 



 

understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay the Reverse Termination Fee when
due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Sellers commences a Proceeding
that results in a judgment against Buyer for the Reverse Termination Fee,
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, together with the Reverse Termination Fee,
interest on the Reverse Termination Fee from the date of termination of this
Agreement at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Without limiting the Sellers right
to obtain an award of specific performance permitted by _Section 12.15_,
solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee or
expanding the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is to be
paid, it is agreed that the Reverse Termination Fee is a liquidated damage,
and not a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, while the Sellers may seek both specific performance pursuant
to, and subject to the provisions of, _Section 12.15_, and any other remedy
available to it at law or in equity, under no circumstances shall the Sellers
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
this Agreement and any other remedy available to it at law or in equity,
including payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) If Buyer becomes obligated to pay the Reverse Termination Fee and actually
pays such amount (together with any other payments required to be made
pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_), then (i) the right of the Sellers to receive
the Reverse Termination Fee (together with any other payments required to be
made pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Sellers against Buyer, the Financing Sources (subject to clause (d) below)
and any of their and any of their respective former, current, or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors,
officers, affiliates, employees, representatives or agents (the " _Buyer
Related Parties_ "), with respect to any such termination of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii)
except (A) as provided in the preceding clause (i) and (B) pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, neither the Sellers nor the Company shall bring any
cause of action against or otherwise seek remedies from the Buyer Related
Parties, whether at equity or in law, for breach of contract, in tort or
otherwise, and any such claim is hereby fully waived, released and forever
discharged. The payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (together with any
other payments required to be made pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_) in the
circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any rights or claims against any
Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise; and (ii) subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Financing Agreements under the terms thereof, none
of the parties hereto, nor or any of their respective Affiliates, solely in
their respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source, solely in their respective
capacities as agents, lenders or arrangers in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
at

 



      
 

 



 

law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under
the Financing Agreements related thereto.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _SURVIVAL, INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

9.01 _Agreement to Indemnify_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article IX_, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, partners, members, agents,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnitees_ ") each shall be indemnified, held harmless, compensated and
reimbursed by the Sellers, jointly and severally, as the Buyer Indemnitees
sole and exclusive remedy (other than pursuant to the Seller Guarantee) for
any breach of this Agreement to the extent set forth in this _Article IX_ in
respect of any and all Damages directly incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee as a result of (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty made by the Company or the Sellers in _Article
III_ or _Article V_ of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as
of the Closing as if such representation or warranty had been made on and as
of the Closing (in each case after giving effect to any updated Material
Contracts Schedule pursuant to a permitted Schedule Supplement), (ii) any
breach of, or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company
or the Sellers contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Transaction Expenses not
paid prior to or in connection with the Closing, (iv) any inaccuracy in
_Section 3.07(b)_, (v) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Signing Tax Period (excluding any Taxes
attributable to a breach of _Section 10.02(a)(iii))_, (vi) the matters set
forth on the Specified Matters Schedule (except to the extent any such Damages
constitute Settlement Payments and are taken into account in determining Sale
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.02_), and (vii) any 280G Indemnifiable
Matter.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be indemnified
under _Section 9.01(a)_ for any claim (or series of related claims) for
breach of a representation and warranty set forth in the Disclosure Schedules
(and not, for the avoidance of doubt, a representation and warranty set forth
in _Article III_ or _Article V_ of this Agreement) unless the aggregate
amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees as a result of
such breach exceeds $25,000 (the " _Small Claims Threshold_ "), whereupon the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled (subject to the same limitations
applicable to the applicable section of this Agreement to which such
disclosure relates) to indemnification for all Damages so incurred or
suffered, including the Small Claims Threshold; (ii) no Buyer Indemnitee shall
be indemnified under _Section 9.01(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount
of all Damages incurred or suffered by any or all of the Buyer Indemnitees
hereunder exceeds $2,750,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), whereupon the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled (subject to the other limitations herein)
to indemnification for all Damages incurred or suffered by them only in excess
of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ _that_ such limitation shall not apply
(A) to Damages relating to (1) the breach of a Specified Representation in
_Article III_ or _Article V_ or (2) to the matters referred to in Section
_9.01(a)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , or _(vii_ ) or (B) in the
event of fraud or willful misconduct; and (iii) the maximum aggregate amount
of indemnification that the Buyer

 



       
 

 



 

Indemnitees may recover under _Section 9.01(a)_ shall not exceed $19,250,000
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided further that_ the Cap shall not apply (A) to
Damages relating to (1) the breach of a Specified Representation in _Article
III_ or _Article V_ or (2) to the matters referred to in Section
_9.01(a)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , or _(vii)_ or (B) in the event of
fraud or willful misconduct.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the terms of this _Article
IX_, the Seller, their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, partners, members, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") shall each be
indemnified, held harmless, compensated and reimbursed to the extent set forth
in this _Article IX,_ by Buyer and the Company (jointly and severally) in
respect of any and all Damages directly incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnitee as a result of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement
or as of the Closing as if such representation or warranty had been made on
and as of the Closing, or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement
made by Buyer or, with respect to breaches of covenants to be performed
following the closing, by the Company in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing (x) no Seller Indemnitee shall be indemnified under this _Section
9.01(c)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred or
suffered by any or all of the Seller Indemnitees hereunder exceeds the
Deductible Amount, whereupon the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Damages incurred or suffered by them only in excess of
the Deductible Amount; _provided that_ such limitation shall not apply to
damages relating to the breach of a Specified Representation in _Article IV_
or to Buyers failure to make any of the payments required to be made pursuant
to _Sections 1.04(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ; (y) the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnification that the Seller Indemnitees may recover under _Section
9.01(c)_ shall not exceed the Cap; _provided that_ the Cap shall not apply to
damages relating to the breach of a Specified Representation in _Article IV_
or to Buyers failure to make any of the payments required to be made pursuant
to _Sections 1.04(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ; and (z) no Seller Indemnitee shall
be entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.01(c)_ to the extent the
Damages relate to any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Seller
Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates. Furthermore, no Seller Indemnitee shall
have any right to assert any claims pursuant to this _Article IX_ with
respect to any Damage or other claim to the extent it is (A) primarily a
possible or potential Damage or claim that such Seller Indemnitee believes may
be asserted rather than a Damage or claim that has, in fact, been filed of
record against such Seller Indemnitee or paid or incurred by such Seller
Indemnitee or (B) a Damage or claim with respect to which such Seller
Indemnitee has taken action (or caused action to be taken) to accelerate the
time period in which such matter is asserted or payable.

 



 

(d) This _Article IX_ constitutes the Buyer Indemnitees sole and exclusive
remedy for any and all Damages or other claims (excluding actions for specific
performance or similar injunctive relief or claims of, or causes of action
arising from, actual common law fraud, which may be brought without limitation
under this Agreement against the fraudulent party) relating to or arising from
this Agreement, any of the agreements, documents and instruments executed and
delivered in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated by any of
the foregoing. The Buyer Indemnitees may not avoid such limitation on
liability by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any
other theory of liability. Except as expressly contemplated by _Section
9.01(a)_, no claim (excluding any actions for specific performance or similar
injunctive relief or claims of, or causes of action arising from, actual
common law fraud, which may be brought without limitation under this Agreement
against the fraudulent party)

 



      
 

 



 

shall be brought or maintained by Buyer, its Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or its or their respective
Affiliates, successors or permitted assigns or any other Buyer Indemnitee, and
no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or any other
Person set forth or contained in this Agreement, or any of the agreements,
documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith, the
subject matter of this Agreement, any information, document or material
furnished or made available to Buyer in "data rooms," management presentations
or in any other form in anticipation of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the ownership, operation, management, use,
control of, and other actions or omissions with respect to, the business of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, any of their assets, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any other actions or omissions at or prior to the
Closing. Buyer, its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries), and its and their respective Affiliates, successors and
permitted assigns and any other Buyer Indemnitee hereby irrevocably waive all
such claims of any type or description and hereby agree to indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Seller Indemnitees from and against and in respect of any
and all Damages and other losses incurred by any Seller Indemnitee as a result
of any such claim brought or maintained by any such party against any Seller
Indemnitee in contravention of this _Section 9.01(d)_. EACH BUYER INDEMNITEE
(EACH, A " _RELEASING PARTY_ ") EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY
STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS.
EACH RELEASING PARTY UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN
CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS.
EACH RELEASING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL
AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

(e) For the sole purpose of appropriately apportioning any Taxes relating to
any Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that is attributable to the Tax
period that ends on and includes the date hereof shall be (i) in the case of a
Tax that is not transaction-based, the total amount of such Tax for the full
Tax period that includes the date hereof multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from the beginning of such Tax period
to and including the date hereof and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such full Tax period, and (ii) in the case of a transaction-
based Tax, including a Tax based on net income, the Tax that would be due with
respect to such partial period, if such partial period that includes the date
hereof were a full Tax period, apportioning income, gain, expenses, loss,
depreciation, deductions and credits equitably based on an interim closing of
the books.

 



 

9.02 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 9.02(b)_, all representations and warranties of any
Person contained herein and all claims of any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee in respect of any breach of or indemnity claim under any such
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and shall expire on the date that is eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "). The covenants in this Agreement
(i) that are to be performed prior to the Closing shall terminate at the
Closing (it being understood that claims for breach of such covenants may be
made until the Expiration Date) and (ii) that are to

 



      
 

 



 

be performed at or after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms. Subject to _Section 9.02(b)_, any claims for
indemnification under _Sections 9.01(a)_ or _9.01(c)_ must be made on or
before the Expiration Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
the Specified Representations and the right to make any claim for breach or
inaccuracy thereof pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ or _9.01(c)_
and (ii) the right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)(iv)_ shall
survive the Expiration Date until the date that is sixty (60) days after the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions
thereof) applicable to a third party claim, or to a Governmental Entity
bringing a Proceeding, that, if successful, would constitute an inaccuracy in
or breach of such Specified Representation as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing or give rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.01(a)(iv)_; _provided_ , _however_ , any claims for
indemnification for breach or inaccuracy of the Specified Representations
pursuant to _Sections 9.01(a)_ or _9.01(c)_ must be made on or before the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation referred to in this
sentence.

 



 

(c) To the extent notice of the breach of or indemnity claim under any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is properly given prior to
time specified herein (if any), and for which indemnity is sought under this
_Article IX_, the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall
survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this
_Section 9.02_ solely with respect to the matter (and only to the extent
reasonably within the scope of the matter) in such notice.

 



 

(d) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of parties
hereto, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnitees,
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of
the Indemnitees or any of their representatives.

 



 

9.03 _Claims for Indemnification_. If any Indemnitee shall believe that it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ (including pursuant
to any Third Party Claim), in respect of any Damages, such Indemnitee shall
promptly give the appropriate Indemnifying Party notice of such claim (a "
_Notice of Claim_ "), which must be delivered before the expiration of the
time period specified in _Section 9.02_. Any such Notice of Claim shall set
forth in reasonable detail and to the extent then known the basis for such
claim for indemnification and the amount of the claim, to the extent specified
or otherwise known. Thereafter, with respect to a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business
Days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to such
Third Party Claim. As long as the Notice of Claim is delivered within the time
period specified in _Section 9.02_, the failure of such Indemnitee to give
the Notice of Claim for indemnification promptly shall not adversely affect
such Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder, except to the extent that the
defense of any claim is prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

9.04 _Defense of Claims_. In connection with any claim that may give rise to
indemnity under this _Article IX_ resulting from or arising out of any
action, suit, proceeding or arbitration against an Indemnitee by a Person that
is not a party hereto (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall have
the right to defend against and direct the defense of such Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim but shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of any material changes
with respect to the Third Party Claim and shall, in good faith, satisfy any
reasonable requests made by the Indemnifying Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the Third Party
Claim (i) exclusively relates to business conducted by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, (ii) does not have any material impact on
the future business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (iii) would not
reasonably be expected to seek Damages in excess of $4,812,500 in the
aggregate with all other related Third Party Claims, then the Sellers shall
have the right to direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, whether they
are the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnitee elects to
defend against and direct the defense of any Third Party Claim, it shall
within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) (the " _Dispute Period_ ") notify the Indemnifying Party of its
intent to do so. If the Indemnitee does not elect within the Dispute Period to
defend against and direct the defense of any Third Party Claim or fails to
notify the Indemnifying Party of its election during the Dispute Period, the
Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitee assumes such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnitee shall control
such defense. If the Indemnitee chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all the Indemnifying Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnitees request) the provision to the
Indemnitee of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnitee assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

9.05 _Certain Additional Matters_.

 



 

(a) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to recover or make a
claim for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Damages" be deemed
to include, any Taxes (i) of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to
any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
attributable to a breach of any of the representations set forth in _Section
3.10_ (other than the representations set forth (A) in _Section 3.10(a)_ to
the extent such breach (1) results in an inclusion of an item of income (or an
acceleration of an item of income) attributable to a change from an
impermissible accounting method used in a Pre-Signing Tax Period or (2) is in
respect of the fourth sentence of _Section 3.10(a)_ (related to jurisdictions
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been required to file Tax
Returns) or (B) in _Section 3.10(e)_) or (ii) that are due to the
unavailability in any Tax period (or portion hereof) beginning after the date
of this Agreement of any net operating losses, Tax credits or Tax basis from a
Pre-Signing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) Each Indemnitee agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation under this _Article IX_, such Indemnitee shall
take and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party if so requested by the Indemnifying Party, in order to
take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the related
breach and any Damages for which such Person may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder (including

 



      
 

 



 

taking steps to prevent any contingent liability from becoming an actual
liability and including seeking (but without any obligation to pursue
litigation with respect to) any recoveries of the type described in clause
(ii) of the definition of Damages). If the amount to be netted (in accordance
with clause (ii) of the definition of Damages) from any payment required under
this _Article IX_ is determined, recovered, received or realized after
payment by the Indemnifying Party of an amount otherwise required to be paid
to an Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_, the Indemnitee shall repay to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the
Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Article IX_,
had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

 



 

(c) Any indemnity payments made under of this _Article IX_, shall be treated
for tax purposes as an adjustment of the Sale Consideration paid under this
Agreement to the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under
relevant Tax authorities.

10.01 _Additional Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided by _Article IX_, no claim shall be brought or
maintained (and all claims, rights or causes of action, including those that
any of them may now or in the future have under any Environmental Requirements
(including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Clean Air Act, any analogous state law, and any common law providing
for any remedy or right of recovery with respect to environmental matters),

10.02 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date (" _Buyer Prepared
Returns_ "). To the extent that a Buyer Prepared Return relates to a Pre-
Signing Tax Period or Straddle Period, except as otherwise required by
applicable law, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date immediately preceding the date
hereof.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary that is
not described in _Section 10.02(a)(i)_, the Sellers shall cause the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all such Tax Returns
and promptly pay any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns to the
applicable Taxing Authorities. Except as otherwise required by applicable law,
all such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in effect as of the date immediately preceding the date hereof.
The Sellers will submit any such Tax Return to Buyer for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following the date
hereof, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof). The Sellers
shall make any change to any such Tax Return that is reasonably requested by
Buyer and are not inconsistent with the standard set forth in the second
sentence of this _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ within the earlier of twenty (20)
days after Buyer has received such Tax Return or three (3) days prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the due date for filing such Tax Return. The Seller shall not file any such
Tax Return without Buyers written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

 



 

(iii) Unless required by (A) law or (B) a Taxing Authority pursuant to a final
"determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
comparable provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law), Buyer shall not,
and shall not allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend any Tax
Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Signing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, make any Tax election that has retroactive effect
to any such Tax period with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or otherwise initiate any other Holder Approved Tax Matter without the prior
written consent of the Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may file a claim
for a Tax refund with respect to any Pre-Signing Tax Period or Straddle Period
without the consent of the Sellers and the Sellers shall not be entitled to
the amount of any such Tax refund.

 



 

(b) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund in respect of estimated federal income taxes
deposited by the Company or any its Subsidiaries with the Internal Revenue
Service for the taxable year or period beginning on April 1, 2014 (including
any interest in respect thereof), to the extent that such Tax refund directly
results from the payment of any Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date,
not to exceed an aggregate of $600,000, reduced by any amount paid to the
Sellers at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.02(e)_, which is received by any of
Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing but prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, shall be for the account of the
Sellers, and Buyer shall pay to the Sellers any such refund within fifteen
(15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall request that any
overpayment of such estimated federal income taxes by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that directly results from the payment of any Transaction
Expenses as of the Closing Date be refunded to Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries instead of being credited against future federal income tax
obligations of one of such entities. If any such Tax refund is not requested
by the Sellers or the Company prior to the Closing, Buyer shall request a
refund (but not a credit) on its first federal income Tax return following the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Sellers shall each notify the other
in writing within ten (10) days of the commencement of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding affecting the Taxes or Tax attributes (a
" _Tax Claim_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall have the obligation to notify the Sellers only if
the Tax Claim would, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, or after the
lapse of time, be grounds for indemnification under _Article IX_. Such notice
shall contain factual information describing any asserted Tax liability and
shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Taxing
Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Tax Claim relating solely to a Pre-Signing Tax Period,
the Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to control the conduct of
such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Sellers shall have no
right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim unless the Sellers shall have
first notified Buyer in writing of their intention to do so and of the
identity of counsel, if any, chosen by the Sellers in connection therewith;
(B) the Sellers exercise of rights pursuant to this sentence shall constitute
the Sellers acknowledgement that, as between the Sellers and Buyer, the
Sellers, and not Buyer, shall be liable for any and all Damages directly
resulting from such Tax Claim; (C) the Sellers will keep Buyer informed
concerning the progress of, and developments and events attributable or
relating to such Tax Claim; (D) the Sellers will provide to Buyer copies of
all correspondence and other documents relevant to such Tax Claim; and (E) the
Sellers will not settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Buyer will have the right to participate in the defense of any such
Tax Claim (which will include participation in meetings with Taxing
Authorities and the right to review and comment on written submissions to
taxing authorities) and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Sellers.

 



 

(iii) In the case of any Tax Claim not described in _Section 10.02(c)(ii)_,
Buyer shall have the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such
audit or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if such audit or
proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in a material increase in
Tax liability of any of the Company or any or its Subsidiaries for which the
Sellers would be liable in whole or significant part under _Article IX_, the
Sellers may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding at their
own expense, and Buyer shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without
the consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall provide
the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested (including
access to the personnel and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries) by
the other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any
audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, or any judicial or
administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each shall retain and provide the
requesting party with any records and copies of applicable Tax Returns,
supporting work papers, source documentation or information which may be
relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceeding or determination.

of Buyer, the Sellers and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

condition to Buyer, Company or Sellers, as applicable, consummating the
transactions described herein.

substantial compliance with any such request issued under 15

 



      
 

 



 

U.S.C. §18a(e), (b) to resist in good faith any assertion that the

United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
administering other competition laws, and each of Buyer and the Company shall
have the right to have a representative present at any such meeting. The
parties hereto will not take any action that will have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required approvals or the termination
or expiration of any required waiting periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Buyer and the Company may, as each deems reasonably appropriate,
designate any proprietary or competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 10.06_ as " _Outside Counsel Only Material_ ". Such
material and the information contained therein shall be furnished only to the
outside counsel of the other party, and, subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may mutually enter
into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the other party, or to any other Person, unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the material or its legal
counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.06_,
materials provided to the other party and its outside counsel may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning valuation, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-

DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
ACTION. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH
COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR
INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH ACTION. THE PARTIES FURTHER

agents, attorneys or representatives) in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than

the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
the appellate courts thereof), (ii) submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii)

law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

12.15 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur (for which
monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy) in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Buyer, the Sellers or the Company, as applicable, in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by Buyer, the Sellers or the
Company, as applicable, including if the parties hereto fail to take any
action required of them hereunder to consummate the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that (i) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any of Buyer, the
Sellers or the Company, as applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof against Buyer, the Sellers or the Company, as
applicable, in any court having jurisdiction, without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties
hereto are entitled at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific
performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
12.15_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall this _Section 12.15_, be used, alone or
together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require the Company to
remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company made
herein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
_Section 12.15(a)_, the right of the Sellers and/or the Company to obtain an
injunction or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief with respect to Buyers obligation to effect the Closing shall be
subject to the requirements that (it being understood and agreed that the
Sellers and/or the Companys right to obtain an injunction or other
appropriate form of

 



      
 

 



 

specific performance or equity relief with respect to Buyers other
obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall not be subject to the following
requirements) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing.
