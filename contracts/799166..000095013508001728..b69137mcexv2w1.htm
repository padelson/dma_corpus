 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 10, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ ") is by and among Eastern Bank Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), Eastern Bank, a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (the " _Buyer Bank_ "), Minuteman Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (the " _Merger Sub_ "), MASSBANK Corp., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and MASSBANK, a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the " _Company Bank_ "). 

  

BACKGROUND 

   

 A. The respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Merger Sub, the Company and Company Bank have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic business combination provided for herein, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement: (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "); and (ii) after the Effective Time of the Merger at a date selected by Buyer, Company Bank will merge with and into Buyer Bank, with Buyer Bank as the surviving entity (the " _Bank Merger_ "); 

  

 B. As a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the Company (each a " _Voting Agreement Shareholder_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreement Shareholders_ ") has entered into a Voting Agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each a " _Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Shareholders shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and 

  

 C. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 _NOW, THEREFORE_ , in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth herein, and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation 

   ##### 

  

 

incorporated under the laws of Delaware (the Company, as the surviving
corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 1.2 _Bank Merger_. The Plan of Bank Merger, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto, has been simultaneously entered into between Buyer Bank and Company Bank providing for the Bank Merger, it being intended that the Bank Merger be consummated at a date selected by Buyer in its sole discretion following consummation of the Merger, by, among other things, the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the " _Articles of Merger_ "). 

  

 1.3 _Effective Date and Effective Time; Closing; Effects of the Merger_. 

  

 (a) On the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger related to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger provided for herein shall become effective upon the acceptance for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger or such later date and time as may be set forth in the Certificate of Merger. The date of such filing or such later effective date is herein called the " _Effective Date_." The " _Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be as specified in the Certificate of Merger. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") that will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after all of the conditions to the closing set forth in Article VII (other than conditions to be satisfied at Closing, which are satisfied or waived (subject to applicable law) at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with terms hereof, at the principal offices of Nutter, McClennen and Fish, LLP, in Boston, Massachusetts, or such other place or on such other date as the parties may mutually agree upon in writing (such date, the " _Closing Date_ "), unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. At the Closing, there shall be delivered to Buyer and the Company the certificates and other documents required to be delivered pursuant to Article VII. 

   

 (c) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the appropriate provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers, and franchises, and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, as provided under Section 259 of the DGCL. 

   

 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall contain such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to the exculpation and indemnification provided for in Section 6.8 hereof), shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, 

   ##### 

  

    

except the name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be MASSBANK
Corp., until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with
applicable law. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (which shall contain such provisions as are necessary to
give full effect to the exculpation and indemnification provided for in
Section 6.8 hereof), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable
law. 

  

 1.5 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of whom shall serve in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.6 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

MERGER CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  

  

 2.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock and Dissenting Shares) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive $40.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, in each case without interest and less applicable Tax withholdings, if any, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share of the Company Common Stock and such other documents as Buyer reasonably may require in accordance with Section 2.3. 

   

 2.2 _Rights as Shareholders; Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. 

  

 (a) All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") previously evidencing such shares, 

    ##### 

  

    

and all uncertificated shares, shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive any unpaid dividend
with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made, other than transfers of the Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 2.3 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and on or before the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts payable under Section 2.1(c) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Buyer shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the date thereof, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (each an " _Effective Date Holder_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form for transactions of this nature (which shall specify that for holders of shares issued in certificated form, delivery of such holders Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer or the Paying Agent reasonably may specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and instructions for use by holders of shares issued in uncertificated form. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent shall reasonably require, including where applicable delivery of Certificates, each Effective Date Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock covered by the letter of transmittal, in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. If a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock has occurred but has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check representing the proper amount of Merger Consideration may be issued to the transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents and endorsements required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable 

    ##### 

  

    

stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as provided in this
Section 2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock represented thereby. No
interest will be paid or accrue on any amounts payable upon surrender of any
Certificate. 

   

 (c) Promptly following the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Buyer all cash and any documents in its possession or control relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate may surrender such Certificate to Buyer and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of the Certificate without any interest thereon. 

   

 (d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this Article II;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of an indemnity or bond in customary amount against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate or ownership thereof. 

   

 (e) The Paying Agent shall invest any funds held by it for purposes of this Section 2.3 as directed by Buyer, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer. To the extent that there are losses with respect to any such investments, Buyer shall be responsible to ensure that the Paying Agent has access to funds sufficient to make any required payments under this Article II promptly when due. 

   

 (f) None of Buyer, the Company, Buyer Bank, Company Bank, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three (3) years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any of the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the amount payable in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 2.4 _Options_ _._  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other similar right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each an " _Option_ ") that then remains outstanding and originally was granted under any Employee Program, whether or not then vested or exercisable, automatically shall be terminated at the Effective Time and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive thereupon in full satisfaction of such Option as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such 

    ##### 

  

    

Option and (y) the number (determined without reference to vesting
requirements or other limitations on exercisability) of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and the
Company acknowledge and agree that any Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price greater than the Merger
Consideration shall expire without the right to receive any Company Common
Stock or any payment in lieu thereof. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall mail to each holder of an Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a check in an amount equal to the Option Consideration due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.4(a) in respect of such Option. 

   

 2.5 _Tax Withholding_ _._ Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Options, as the case may be, such amounts as Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law.

reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Company Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect
to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not
such Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Company
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal from Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction, and shall include any public announcement by any Person (including any regulatory application or notice, whether in draft or final form) of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized, independent financial advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the Company Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby, and any requirement to obtain additional financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the Company Shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal. 

   

 (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications) unless (i) such materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure of such materials may reasonably be deemed to contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree. The Company agrees that it shall keep Buyer informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including any amendment or modification to such proposal, offer or request). 

   

 (d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company Recommendation, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the 

    ##### 

  

 

Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it
being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the
Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.5(b)) or (B) requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(d), prior to the date of the Company Meeting, the Company Board may approve or recommend to the Company Shareholders a Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation in connection therewith (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the third (3rd) Business Day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.5) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that the Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its Affiliates that the Company proposes to accept) if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized, independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer, the Company and the Company Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a Company Subsequent Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e) and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the Company Recommendation or the making of a Company Subsequent Determination by the Company Board shall not change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with the Companys obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a change in the Company Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure, or (ii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.5.

 6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of each former and present director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the similar governing documents of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof (including, without limitation, the right to the advancement of expenses) with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. During such period, Buyer shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time was an Indemnified Party in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made 

    ##### 

  

 

either prior to the Effective Time or within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue
until disposition of any and all such claims. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage, which, by its terms, shall survive the Merger, for the Companys directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company so long as the aggregate cost is less than $200,000 (the " _Maximum D andO Tail Premium_"); _provided_ that, if the cost of such endorsement exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, the Company shall obtain such an endorsement with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding Maximum DandO Tail Premium. 

   

 (c) In the event Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

   

 6.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) For purposes of this Section 6.9, the term " _Bank_ " shall refer to Company Bank after the Merger and until such time as the Bank Merger in Section 1.2 occurs, after which the term shall refer to Buyer Bank. 

   

 (b) For the 12 month period commencing on the Effective Date, Buyer shall cause, and cause Bank to, maintain the current compensation levels, excluding any stock-based benefits, for the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who remain employed by Bank after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") at the same levels that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those in effect for the Company Employees on the date hereof. With respect to retirement, health, and welfare benefits, Buyer may cause or may cause the Bank to cause, such Company Employees to be enrolled in plans of Buyer or Buyer Bank during such 12 month period (instead of plans of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company), provided that during such 12 month period the retirement, health and welfare benefits offered shall be reasonably comparable to those offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer Bank. For purposes of any such plan, Buyer shall cause, and shall cause Buyer Bank or the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company or any Subsidiary of Company attributable to any 

    ##### 

  

 

period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other
appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum
waiting periods for participation but excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit plan of Buyer. For purposes of determining any matching or
other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan of Buyer Bank, compensation
prior to the Effective Time will not be considered. Without limiting the
foregoing, and subject to the consent of Buyers or Buyer Banks health
insurance carriers, Buyer shall cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any health or similar plan of Buyer to be waived with respect to the
Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent the Company
Employees had satisfied any similar limitations or requirements under the
corresponding plan in which the Company Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and any deductibles paid by the
Company Employees under any of Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans in
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be credited towards
deductibles under the health plans of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer.
Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to attempt and cause the
Surviving Corporation to attempt, to make appropriate arrangements with its
insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result. Except with respect to employees
who have entered into employments agreements with the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and subject to Section 6.9(j) hereof, the Company Employees who
remain employed after the Effective Time shall be considered to be employed
by Buyer "at will" and nothing shall be construed to limit the ability of
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such
Company Employee at any time. 

   

 (c) Following the Effective Date, Bank may choose to maintain any, all, or none of the Employee Programs in its sole discretion. However, for any Employer Program terminated for which there is a comparable Buyer Bank benefit plan of general applicability (meaning that the plan is available to all employees satisfying uniformly applied age and service requirements), all Company Employees shall be entitled to participate prospectively after the Effective Date in such Buyer Bank benefit plan (or a comparable plan offered by Bank) to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in such benefit plans may occur, if at all, at different times with respect to different plans). Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Buyer, Buyer Bank or Bank to amend or terminate any of the Employee Programs or Buyer Bank benefit plans in accordance with their terms at any time. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Employee Program subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such plan to be amended to the extent, in Buyers reasonable judgment, such an amendment is necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code (or to cause such plan, in whole or in part, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code by preserving the terms of such plan, and the law in effect, for benefits earned and vested as of December 31, 2004) prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the deadline imposed by the IRS for such amendment. Such amendments shall be provided to Buyer and its counsel at least ten (10) days prior to their proposed adoption by the Company or Company Bank and shall be subject to the prior approval of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) During the one-year period commencing as of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Buyer (or Bank) shall honor, with respect to Company Employees employed as of the Effective Time, the Severance Pay Plan of Company Bank (the " _Company Bank Severance Pay Plan_ ") (referenced at page 6.49 of the Employee Handbook provided to Buyer, Buyer Bank and Merger Sub as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in connection with the involuntary termination of employment, other than for cause, of any Company Employee (excluding any employee who is party to an employment agreement, change-in-control agreement or any other agreement which provides for severance payments or who separates from service in connection with a business transaction between the Buyer or Bank and another entity that offers employment to the employee immediately following the effective date of the transaction), in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions as set forth in the Company Severance Pay Plan with respect to involuntary employment terminations for reasons other than cause. Neither Buyer nor Bank shall be obligated to pay any amount to any Company Employee who does not execute a general release and waiver of claims, in a form satisfactory to Buyer, of any and all claims, known or unknown, against Buyer, Buyer Bank, the Company, Company Bank, and officers, trustees, directors, employees, attorneys and affiliates of the above. 

   

 (f) Buyer shall honor, in accordance with their terms, all compensation, employment, severance, change-of-control, and deferred compensation obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as set forth on _Schedule 6.9(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (g) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its ESOP to be terminated at the Effective Time. 

   

 (h) The Company shall not terminate prior to the Effective Time any Employee Program that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. After the Effective Time, at its sole election, Buyer will determine whether to terminate any such Employee Program, merge it into a defined benefit pension plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank in a transaction meeting all ERISA and Code requirements including, without limitation, Section 414(l) of the Code, to maintain it separately and to freeze or modify further accruals under such plan, or take other action. Upon Buyers reasonable request, the Company shall cooperate with Buyer Bank to facilitate such action, on or after the Effective Date,  _provided_ that any termination of such Employee Program is effected in a manner that does not adversely affect such Employee Programs qualification under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. Buyer Bank, Bank and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such a termination and the associated distribution of all assets of each such terminated Employee Program. 

   

 (i) Nothing in this Section 6.9, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.9. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 6.9 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this Section 6.9 is intended (i) to amend any Employee Program, (ii) interfere with Buyers or Banks or the Surviving Corporations right from and after the 

    ##### 

  

 

Effective Date to amend or terminate any Employee Program or (iii) interfere
with Buyers or Banks or the Surviving Corporations right from and after
the Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by
any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant. 

   

 (j) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the "employee welfare benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, known as the Company Bank Severance Pay Plan and referenced in Section 6.9(e) to be administered at all times in accordance with the requirements for exemption from Section 409A of the Code available under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). 

   

 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

  

 (a) Each of Buyer and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Buyer Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or (b) notwithstanding the standards set forth in Section 3.1(c) or 4.1(c), as applicable, would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. No such notice by Buyer or the Company shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to Buyers or the Companys obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the contemplated Closing Date, the Company shall supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any material matter which, if existing, occurring or Known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedules or that is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to update the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent such change is as a result of any action taken at the request of Buyer. No supplement or amendment to the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in Article III in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a), or the compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements contained herein. 

   

 6.11 _Confidentiality Agreement_. 

  

 (a) The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect after the date hereof in accordance with its terms.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees to provide Buyer (i) a copy of each report filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing thereof, (ii) a consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations, without related notes, within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month, prepared in accordance with the Companys current financial reporting practices, and (iii) promptly after the end of each quarter, a schedule comparable to _Schedule 3.23_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule current as of the end of the most recent quarter or as recent as practical.

 (b) Each environmental assessment shall include an estimate by the environmental consulting firm preparing such environmental assessment of the costs to investigate, monitor, clean up, or remediate, as the case may be, the "potential environmental condition(s)" or "recognized environmental condition(s)" identified in any Phase I Environmental Assessment.

understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (i) neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of the Company, Company Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the Company shall not be

 (c) No accrual or reserve or change in policy or procedure, or any divestiture of investment securities or loans, made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the request of Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustment shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of the Company or its management with any such adjustments.
