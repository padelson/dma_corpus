clerical error; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall have notified
the Purchaser in writing of each disputed item, specifying the estimated
amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
for such dispute, within 20 Business Days of the Purchasers delivery of the
Closing Statement to the Seller. During such 20 Business Day period, to the
extent reasonably requested by the Seller, the Purchaser will make available
to the Seller and its auditors and advisors all records and work papers used
in preparing the Closing Statement, including the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and provide reasonable access to members of its
accounting and financial staff in connection with the Sellers review thereof.
In the event that the Seller delivers a notice of dispute as set forth above,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt to reconcile their differences,
and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. If the Seller and the Purchaser
are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 20 Business Days
after the receipt by the Purchaser of the Sellers written notice of dispute,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to RSM US LLP (or, if such firm shall decline or is unable to act
or is not, at the time of such submission, independent of the Seller and the
Purchaser, to another independent accounting firm of international reputation

the Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on an independent accounting firm, such
firm shall be selected by mutual agreement of the independent accounting firms
regularly used by the Seller and the Purchaser in the conduct of their
respective business) (either RSM US LLP or such other accounting firm being
referred to herein as the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). In selecting the
Independent Accounting Firm for purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereby
waive any conflict or potential conflict arising from any services performed
by such firm for the Seller or the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates. The Purchaser and the Seller shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to, within 30 days after
such submission, determine what it believes in its professional judgment to be
the most accurate calculation of the remaining disputed items in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and report to the Seller and the Purchaser
upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser. With respect to each disputed
item, such determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall not be
in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by
the Purchaser in the Closing Statement or the Seller in the notice of dispute.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between the Seller and the Purchaser in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party
(as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted.

 



22 (ii) In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Closing Statement shall be deemed final

of the Seller to notify the Purchaser of a dispute within 20 Business Days of
the Purchasers delivery of the Closing Statement to the Seller, (B) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)(i)_, by the Seller
and the Purchaser, and (C) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)(i)_, by the Independent Accounting Firm. Within three
Business Days of the Closing Statement being deemed final, a Purchase Price
adjustment shall be made as follows:

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then (A) the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such Actual Adjustment
Amount, net of applicable withholding Taxes, if any, by wire transfer or
delivery of immediately available funds to the Purchase Price Bank Account and
(B) the Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to the Seller an amount of the Escrow Funds equal to the Escrow
Amount.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Seller
and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) release to
the Purchaser an amount of the Escrow Funds equal to the absolute value of
such Actual Adjustment Amount, (B) if the absolute value of such Actual
Adjustment Amount is less than the Escrow Amount, release to Seller an amount
of the Escrow Funds equal to the Escrow Amount _minus_ the absolute value of
the Actual Adjustment Amount and (C) if the absolute value of such Actual
Adjustment Amount is greater than the Escrow Amount, release to Purchaser an
amount of the Escrow Funds equal to the Escrow Amount and the Seller shall pay
to the Purchaser an amount equal to the excess of the Actual
Adjustment Amount over the Escrow Amount.

(d) _Interest on Payments_. Any payments required to be made by the Seller or
the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_ shall bear interest from the
Closing Date through and including the date of payment at the per annum prime

Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall not be required to
provide any such access or disclose any such information to the Purchaser or
any such other person if such disclosure would, in the Sellers discretion
(after consultation with outside counsel), (i) jeopardize any attorney-client
or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable Laws. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to give to the Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, any rights to control or direct the operations of
the Seller or Subsidiary in respect of the Business prior to the Closing
Date.

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Seller prior to the Closing, for a period of five years after
the Closing, the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and records relating to
the Business relating to periods prior to the Closing and (ii)

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
the Non-Disclosure Agreement remains in full force and effect and (ii) the
Non-Disclosure Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
from and after the Closing. From and after the Closing and until the fifth

to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives to, hold in confidence any and all non-public or otherwise
Confidential Information, whether written or oral, exclusively related to the
Business and the Purchaser. For purposes of this _Section 5.03_, "
_Confidential Information_ " shall mean all non-public information relating to

until publication), product development, customer and supplier lists, pricing
and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of Customer contracts,
operations methods, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition
plans, employees and other service providers, and all other confidential or
proprietary information used exclusively in the Business. In the event that
the Seller or any such agent, representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or
director becomes legally compelled to disclose any such Confidential
Information, the Seller shall provide notice to the Purchaser in writing and
consult with the Purchaser regarding the disclosure of such information and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any appropriate protective order,
at the Purchasers cost, or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information. In the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Purchaser waives compliance with
this  _Section 5.03_, the Seller shall furnish only that portion of such
Confidential Information which, in the opinion of the Sellers counsel (which
may include in-house counsel), is legally required to be provided and exercise
its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information. This _Section 5.03_ shall not apply to any
information that, at the time of disclosure, is available publicly and was not
disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the Seller or any of its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors. In addition,
with respect to Intellectual Property, any combination of features shall not
be deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely because the individual
features are in the public domain unless the combination itself and its
principle of operation are in the public domain or would be reasonably
understood by one skilled in the applicable art.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will reasonably cooperate with
the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals. On May 20, 2016, each Party filed its
Notification and Report Form required under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate

 



42  Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement shall not obligate the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
make any sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of the assets,
properties or businesses of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or of the
assets, properties, businesses to be acquired pursuant hereto or otherwise
take any action that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates or those that the Purchaser is acquiring pursuant
to this Agreement. The Seller, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates
shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or approval of all
third parties necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) any such consents and approvals
to the assignment of any Contracts, including Customer Contracts and any
Contracts set forth on  _Section 3.02 of the Disclosure Schedule_ and (ii)
the amendment of each ATandT Contract to extend the term of each such contract
until August 31, 2020.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall cooperate and use its reasonable efforts to assist the
Seller in obtaining such consents and amendments;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such consent or amendment
or to consent to any change in the terms of any Contract.

 

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, in the event that any consent,
approval or authorization necessary or desirable in order to facilitate the
operation of the Business or to preserve any right or benefit under any
Contract to which the Seller is a party in respect of the Business is not
obtained prior to the Closing, the Seller will, subsequent to the Closing,
cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such consent, approval
or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable; _provided_ , _however_
, that other than in respect of a failure to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement, including this _Section 5.04_, the Seller shall have no
Liability for the failure to obtain any consent, approval or authorization
prior to or after the Closing. If any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability is
not able to be transferred to the Purchaser except with the consent of any
third party and such consent has not been obtained by the Closing Date, (i)
the transfer of such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability shall not be
effective as of the Closing Date, but rather such Purchased Asset or Assumed
Liability shall be transferred to the Purchaser only upon such time as such
consent has been obtained, (ii) each Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts and cooperate with the other Party
to obtain such consent as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and
(iii) except with respect to any Customer Contract (which shall be governed
exclusively by _Section 5.04(e)_), to the extent permitted under any
relevant underlying Contract, the Seller shall deliver or remit to the
Purchaser all economic benefit of such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability
and the Purchaser shall perform the Sellers commercial obligations relating
to such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability until such time as such
Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability may be assigned to Purchaser pursuant to
the foregoing clause (i). For the avoidance of doubt, if any Contract included
in the Purchased Assets cannot be assigned by the Seller to the Purchaser at
the Closing and the Purchaser cannot otherwise obtain the benefits of such
Contract pursuant to this _Section 5.04_, the Purchaser shall not assume, or
have any Liability in respect of, such Contract.

 



43 (e) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that if any consent, approval or
authorization necessary to effect the transfer of a Customer Contract cannot
be obtained with respect to such Customer Contract, the Seller and its
Affiliates shall to the extent permitted, subcontract to the Purchaser the
performance of any such Customer Contract, in which case (A) the Purchaser
shall satisfy all obligations of the Seller and its Affiliates under such
Customer Contract, (B) the Seller and its Affiliates shall promptly pay,
assign and remit to the Purchaser all cash and other consideration received
by the Seller and its Affiliates in respect of such obligations satisfied by
the Purchaser, and (C) from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller and its representatives for any and all Losses incurred
in connection with the Purchasers performance of (or as a result of the
failure of the Purchaser to perform) such obligations. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not limit the closing condition set forth in 
_Section 8.02(f)(i)_.

SECTION 5.05. _Use of the Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, neither the Seller nor its Affiliates shall
use, license or permit any third party to use any of the Transferred

the Closing Date, and subject to the terms of any existing Contracts to which
Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party, Seller hereby grants, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable,
transferable, sublicenseable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license
to Purchaser, its Affiliates and its and their employees, contractors,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Licensees_ ") in, to

its Affiliates in connection with the operation of the Business (other than
the Business Intellectual Property) and owned by Seller or its Affiliates as

 



44  of the Closing Date (the " _Retained Intellectual Property_ "), to use the
Retained Intellectual Property solely in connection with the continued
operation of the Business following the Closing. The foregoing license
includes the right for the Purchaser Licensees to make, and have made on their
behalf, copies, modifications, enhancements, derivative works and improvements

the parties to this Agreement, any and all such Improvements shall be owned by
Purchaser without any duty of disclosure or accounting to Seller or its
Affiliates.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the
Closing or (ii) the termination of this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates, nor any of its or their respective officers, employees,
directors, agents or other representatives will (a) solicit, initiate,
encourage or accept any other inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person

Business or the Purchased Assets, including any acquisition or purchase of the
capital stock of the Seller resulting in a change of control of the Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries of the Seller engaged in the Business, (y) to enter
into any merger, recapitalization, reorganization, joint venture or other

any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with any
other Person regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the date hereof

SECTION 5.09. _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the later of the
fourth anniversary thereof and the date to which the ATandT Contracts are
extended, which extension date shall not go beyond August 31, 2020 (the "

and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or carry on the
Business, (ii) engage in, carry on or provide the Wireline Services to any

or provide the Wireless Services to ATandT in the United States or Canada or

this _Section 5.09(a)_, ownership by the Seller or its Affiliates of

any competitor which are listed on any national securities exchange shall not
be deemed to be in violation of this _Section 5.09(a)_. For purposes of this
_Section 5.09(a)_, the term "engages in" 

 



45  shall encompass and include, without limitation, owning an interest in,
managing, operating, joining, controlling, lending money or rendering
financial or other assistance to or participating in or being connected with
a business, whether as an officer, employee, partner, shareholder, member,
consultant or otherwise, and whether the activity is performed or occurs

and ending on the second anniversary thereof, the Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage
in or carry on the business of providing home and business
installation/maintenance services for multi-system cable operators. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.09(a)_ shall prevent the
Seller, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from engaging in or carrying on the
Excluded Business.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, and as a separate and independent covenant,
during the Restricted Period, the Seller shall not, and shall use its
reasonable efforts to ensure that none of its Affiliates, Solicit Customers of
the Business to modify, reduce or terminate their business or relationship

Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Business. For purposes of
this _Section 5.09_ and _Section 5.10_, " _Solicit_ " means any direct or
indirect communication of any kind whatsoever, regardless of by whom
initiated, inviting, advising, encouraging or requesting any Person, in any
manner, to take or refrain from taking any action.

(c) As a separate and independent covenant, Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, during the Restricted Period, take any preparatory
steps toward engaging in the activities prohibited by the first sentence of
_Section 5.09(a)_ herein. For purposes of this _Section 5.09_, "
_Preparatory Steps_ " means meeting or communicating with any potential
customers regarding entry into the Business.

 

(d) The Restricted Period shall be extended by the length of any period during
which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is in breach of the terms of this
_Section 5.09_. The Seller acknowledges that (i) the covenants of the Seller
set forth in this _Section 5.09_ and _Section 5.10_ are an essential element
of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Seller to comply
with these covenants, the Purchaser would not have entered into this
Agreement, (ii) this _Section 5.09_ and _Section 5.10_ constitute
independent covenants that shall not be affected by performance or
nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by the Purchaser and
(iii) the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.09_ and _Section 5.10_ are
reasonable (with respect to scope, duration and otherwise) and are necessary
to protect and preserve the Business. Moreover, the Seller agrees that if the
scope of any covenant set forth in this _Section 5.09_ or _Section 5.10_
shall be held to be too broad to be enforceable under Delaware law, then such
covenant shall only be enforceable to the extent allowed under Delaware law
and any unenforceable part of such covenant shall be deemed not to be
contained in such covenant.

 

(e) If the Seller sells all or substantially all of its assets in a
transaction or series of related transactions it shall make provision for the
purchaser of such assets to assume all of the Sellers obligations under this
_Section 5.09_; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict any
purchaser of such assets of the Seller from engaging in any line of
business in which such purchaser was engaged prior to the acquisition of such
assets.

 



46 SECTION 5.10. _Employee Non-Solicitation; No Hire_. During the Restricted
Period, the Seller shall not, and shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure
that none of its Affiliates, solicit for employment or hire any individuals

anniversary of the Closing Date) (a) New Employees engaged in the operation
of the Business at the manager level or above or, with respect to tower crews,
at the supervisor or foreman level or above or (b) employees of the Purchaser
engaged in the operation of the Business at the foreman or supervisor level
or above or (ii) who are employees of the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the
Purchaser with whom the Seller first came into contact in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that the foregoing will not
prohibit a general solicitation to the public of general advertising and the
related hiring from such general solicitation and (ii) that the restrictions
in this _Section 5.10_ shall not apply to the hiring of a person who has not
been so employed for the past six month and who was not solicited by the
Seller or any of its Affiliates in violation of this  _Section 5.10_ prior
to termination of his or her employment.

SECTION 5.11. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller
hereby waives compliance by the other party with any applicable bulk sale or
bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the
Purchased Assets to the Purchaser (other than any obligations of a Seller
with respect to the application of the proceeds therefrom). Pursuant to
_Article IX_, the Seller has agreed to indemnify the Purchaser against any
and all Liabilities (including any Liabilities for Taxes of the Seller as a
transferee or otherwise) which may be asserted by third parties against the
Purchaser as a result of any noncompliance by the Purchaser and the Seller
with any such law.

 

SECTION 5.12. _Further Action_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and
deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including taking such actions as are reasonably necessary to
expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.01_, the Seller acknowledges
and agrees that certain assets that constitute Purchased Assets may not have
been transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. If, following
the Closing, the Seller or the Purchaser determines, acting reasonably and in
good faith, that any Purchased Assets were not so transferred, the parties
agree to cooperate to transfer such Purchased Assets to the Purchaser without
payment of any further consideration.

(c) The Seller agrees that it shall forward or remit promptly (and in no
event later than two Business Days after receipt) to the Purchaser any payment
or the amount of any payment, as the case may be, relating to a Purchased
Asset or the Business received by the Seller after the Closing and related to
the Purchased Assets or the Business after the Closing, and shall

 



47  forward any other document pertaining to any such payment received after the
Closing. The Purchaser agrees that it shall forward or remit promptly (and in
no event later than two Business Days after receipt) to the Seller any
payment or the amount of any payment, as the case may be, relating to a
Purchased Asset or the Business received by the Purchaser after the Closing
and related to the Purchased Assets or the Business prior to the Closing, and
shall forward any other document pertaining to any such payment received after
the Closing. Each such remittance shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, pursuant to the applicable Partys payment
instructions (or such other method as the parties shall mutually agree if at
any time the volume of remittances no longer justifies use of wire transfer).

 

SECTION 5.13. _Leased Vehicles_. To the extent the Seller is unable to assign
the Leases related to the Leased Vehicles, the Purchaser shall have the
option, at the Closing, to purchase each Leased Vehicle from the respective
lessor of such Leased Vehicle for the applicable Buy-Out Amount. Upon such
purchase, such lessor shall release the Seller, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, from all obligations with respect to
the Leased Vehicles. _Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth, to
the Sellers Knowledge, the respective lessors estimated Buy-Out Amount for
each Leased Vehicle as of a date on or about the applicable dates set forth
in _Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedule_, subject to adjustments in
connection with, among other things, final vehicle mileage determinations,
applicable taxes and additional lease payments. All costs and expenses in
connection with the actions described in this _Section 5.13_ (including
payment of the applicable Buy-Out Amounts) shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 

SECTION 5.14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

 

SECTION 5.15. _Transition Services_. Between the date hereof and the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a
transition services agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ") to be
effective on the Closing Date pursuant to which Seller will provide to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to the Business the scope of
services specified on _Section 5.15 of the Disclosure Schedule_ and such
other services as reasonably agreed by the parties hereto for the time periods
specified on such schedule. The Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith the payment terms for such scope of services; provided that the payment
terms shall reflect Sellers actual cost to provide such services without any
mark-up or allocation of corporate overhead or other similar costs.

 

SECTION 5.16. _Katy Sublease Agreement_. Between the date hereof and the
Closing, the Seller will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and the
applicable landlord in the negotiation of a subleasing arrangement (the "
_Katy Sublease Agreement_ "), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Purchaser, between the Seller and the Purchaser in respect of the Leased
Real Property located at 22220 Merchants Way, Suite 190, Katy, Texas (the "
_Katy Property_ "). The Purchasers rent under the Katy Sublease Agreement
shall not exceed its pro rata share of the rent under the existing lease in
respect of Katy Property based on the amount of space subleased to the
Purchaser compared to the total space at the Katy Property.

 



48 SECTION 5.17. _Facilities Access_. In order to facilitate the removal of
certain assets that constitute Purchased Assets therefrom, for 30 days

SECTION 5.18. _Noteholder Consent_. In the event Seller commences the Exchange
Offer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise seeks to amend or
restructure the Senior Secured Notes, including any consent solicitation (the
"Notes Restructuring"), then Seller shall condition the consummation of the
Exchange Offer or any Notes Restructuring on obtaining the Noteholder Consent
and shall not waive such condition without the consent of the Purchaser, not
to be unreasonably withheld. If the Seller obtains the Noteholder Consent,
then the Purchaser shall agree to release the Indemnity Escrow Amount as set
forth in _Section 9.07(b)_.

SECTION 5.19. _Employees_. Within 10 Business Days of the date hereof, the

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01.  _Offer of Employment_. No later than 20 Business Days
following the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall make
conditional offers of employment to all Business Employees, subject to the
Purchasers established hiring and onboarding criteria (including, without
limitation, applicable background checks, drug screening and verification of
employment authorization). The Purchaser shall employ each of the Business
Employees, effective as of the Closing, who satisfy the established hiring
and onboarding criteria (each of such Business Employees who, as of the
Closing, satisfies all of Purchasers established hiring and onboarding
criteria and has accepted the Purchasers offer of employment,
hereafter referred to as a " _New Employee_ "). The Seller shall retain
Liability for any and all severance or other termination-related costs, if
any, with respect to Business Employees who do not become

 



49  New Employees. Once employed by the Purchaser, the New Employees will be
eligible to participate in the Purchasers employee benefit plans on terms and
conditions applicable to similarly-situated Purchaser employees. The medical,
dental and health plans of the Purchaser applicable to each New Employee (x)
shall not contain any exclusions for pre-existing conditions (other than
conditions which barred coverage under the Sellers corresponding plans), and
(y) shall immediately, without any waiting period, cover as of Closing each
New Employee who elects and is eligible for coverage under such plans. In
addition, the Purchaser shall grant each New Employee full credit for all
periods of employment with the Seller for eligibility, vesting and accrual
purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Purchaser applicable to such
New Employee (except that this sentence shall not obligate the Purchaser to
grant benefit accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan for any
period of employment occurring prior to the date of the Closing); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit to any such employee or the funding for any such benefit. All New
Employees will be considered at-will employees.

 

SECTION 6.02. _Employee Plans; Contributions for Periods Prior to Closing_. As
of the Closing, the Seller shall take all necessary and appropriate actions
to terminate the participation of the New Employees under the Plans and the
New Employees shall cease to accrue any additional benefits under the Plans.
The Purchaser shall not be deemed a successor to any of the Plans. The Seller
shall retain all assets and Liabilities under the Plans and shall remain
obligated for all claims for benefits and benefit entitlements under the
Plans.

 

SECTION 6.03. _WARN_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligation
with respect to the New Employees under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and
Notification Act of 1988 and any applicable state or local equivalent arising
or accruing after the Closing Date (collectively, " _WARN_ "). The Seller
shall be responsible for any such obligation arising or accruing under WARN
on or before the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good
faith to determine whether any notification may be required under WARN as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.04. _COBRA_. The Seller shall be responsible for the administration
of and shall retain any and all Liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage
with respect to the New Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries for
"qualifying events" occurring prior to and including the date on which the New
Employee becomes a New Employee (for purposes of clarity, to the extent such
New Employees are covered under a Plan providing for such COBRA continuation
benefits), and the Purchaser shall be responsible for all obligations and
Liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage for New Employees and their
dependents and beneficiaries with respect to "qualifying events" occurring
after the date on which the New Employee becomes a New Employee (for purposes
of clarity, to the extent such New Employees are covered under a Plan
providing for COBRA continuation benefits).

SECTION 6.05. _Accrued Paid Time Off_. The Seller shall, upon the Closing,
make a payment to each New Employee in the amount of the value of his or her
accrued but unused vacation days, sick days and other paid time off, if any,
in each case less applicable Taxes.

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01.  _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other in (a) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund relating to the Purchased
Assets or the Business, (b) determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business, (c)
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business, or (d) making
representations to or furnishing information to parties subsequently desiring
to purchase any part of the Purchased Assets or the Business from the
Purchaser. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents in their possession relating to
rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees) available on
a basis mutually convenient to all parties to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided under this _Section 7.01_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 5.01_, the Seller shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters
relevant to the Purchased Assets or the Business for any Straddle Period and
for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by the Purchaser in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods and (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller shall dispose of any such
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the
Purchaser shall be given the opportunity, after 30 days prior written notice,
to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as the Purchaser may
select (at such the Purchasers expense). Any information obtained under this
_Section 7.01_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with  _Section
5.03_, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

 

SECTION 7.02. _Conveyance Taxes_. All Conveyance Taxes incurred as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid equally by Purchaser and
the Seller. The Party required to do so under Tax Law, after review and
consent by the other Party, shall file such applications and documents as
shall permit any such Conveyance Tax to be assessed and paid on or after the
Closing. The parties required to do so under Tax Law shall execute and
deliver all instruments and certificates as are necessary to comply with the
foregoing.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (i)
Property Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets allocable to the Pre-Closing
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days during the Straddle Period that fall within 

 



51  the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes)
relating to the Purchased Assets for the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed
as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the date hereof. If any Taxes
subject to proration are paid by Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on
the other hand, the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or in the event
a refund of any portion of such Taxes previously paid is received, such
refund) shall be paid promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of such
Taxes (or promptly following the receipt of any such refund). Any
payments required to be made to the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
7.03(a)_ shall be made using funds other than the Escrow Funds.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all installments of
special assessments or other charges on or with respect to the Purchased
Assets payable by the Seller for any period in which the Closing shall occur
(including base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all municipal,
utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas charges,
garbage or waste removal, and cost of fuel) shall be apportioned as of the
Closing and each party shall pay its proportionate share promptly upon the
receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such
charges or rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified
period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the
Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed based upon usage of
utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter
readings taken on the Closing Date.

(c) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent,
license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the
extent attributable to the operation of the Business for any period in which
the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Seller shall not be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any period
from and after the Closing Date, and if Purchaser or the Seller, as the case
may be, shall receive any such payments after the Closing Date, it shall
promptly remit to such other party its share of such payments. 

(d) The prorations pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ may be calculated after
the Closing, as each item to be prorated (including any such Tax, obligation,
assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee or revenue)
accrues or comes due; _provided_ that, in any event, except with respect to
Taxes, any such proration shall be calculated not later than thirty (30) days
after the party requesting the proration of any item obtains the information
required to calculate such proration.

judgments and penalties (including reasonable attorneys and consultants
fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (including any Action
brought or otherwise initiated by any of them) (hereinafter a " _Loss_ "),
arising out of or resulting from:

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained

SECTION 9.03. _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

 

(a) The Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a " _Seller Indemnified

against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser

"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein);

 



56 (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in

SECTION 9.04. _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, except with respect to indemnification
claims relating to Taxes:

(a) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for

Fundamental Representations, respectively, or in respect of intentional
misconduct or fraud by the Seller or Purchaser, as applicable) unless and

SECTION 9.05. _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any
matter that an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 60 days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises.

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, demand
or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against it or which may give
rise to a claim for a Loss under this _Article IX_, within 30 days of the
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this  _Article IX_ except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by

 



57  such failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other
obligation or Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise
than under this _Article IX_. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within ten days of the receipt
of notice from the Indemnified Party of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict
of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the
Indemnified Party in its sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel
to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required,
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third
Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly
or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.05(b)_ to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the
claimant (or claimants) and such party provide to such other party an
unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.05_ to the contrary, if the
Seller is the Indemnifying Party, it shall not be entitled to undertake the
defense of a Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim relates to or arises
in connection with (x) any criminal Action or any Action seeking equitable or
remedial relief or (y) any Action that is asserted directly by or on behalf of
a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Purchaser or the Business that
is not also a supplier or customer of the Seller.

SECTION 9.06. _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that, except for the right to specifically enforce the provisions of this
Agreement as provided herein and with respect to fraud, the provisions of this
_Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Seller
Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Loss.

SECTION 9.07. _Distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Funds; Survival_.

(a) In the event that (a) the Seller shall not have objected to the amount
claimed by a Purchaser Indemnified Party for indemnification with respect to
any Loss in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement
or (b) the Seller shall have delivered notice of a disagreement as to the
amount of any indemnification requested by a 

 



58  Purchaser Indemnified Party and either (i) the Seller and such Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice,
mutually agreed that the Seller is obligated to indemnify such Purchaser
Indemnified Party for a specified amount and shall have so jointly notified
the Escrow Agent or (ii) a final nonappealable judgment shall have been
rendered by the court having jurisdiction over the matters relating to such
claim by such Purchaser Indemnified Party for indemnification from the Seller
and the Escrow Agent shall have received, in the case of clause (i) above,
written instructions from the Seller and such Purchaser Indemnified Party or,
in the case of clause (ii) above, a copy of the final nonappealable judgment
of the court, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Purchaser Indemnified
Party from the Escrow Funds any amount determined to be owed to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) Upon the earlier of (i) the receipt, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, of the Noteholder Consent and (ii) the twelve-
month anniversary of the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser an amount of the
Escrow Funds equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount _minus_ any amounts
delivered to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.07(a)_ or
for which an unresolved Claim has been made.

 

SECTION 9.08. _Tax Treatment_. The Seller and the Purchaser agree that all
payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other under this
_Article IX_ , under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any
misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or covenants shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment
shall govern for purposes hereof.

SECTION 9.09. _Certain Other Indemnification Matters_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Losses hereunder shall not include (other
than damages actually paid in respect of a Third Party Claim) punitive,
incidental or consequential damages, except to the extent such Losses are a
reasonably foreseeable consequence of any breach of this Agreement or in the
case of fraud. Any Liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Any amount of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments, or reimbursements
actually received by any Indemnified Party in connection with any Losses or
the circumstances giving rise thereto (net of any increase in premiums or
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting
such proceeds, payments or reimbursements) shall be deducted from the
amount of Losses recoverable under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.10. _Subrogation_. To the extent that the Indemnifying Party makes
or is required to make any indemnification payment to the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated
to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of
contribution, and other rights of recovery) that the Indemnified Party or any
of the Indemnified Partys representatives may have against any other Person
with respect to any Losses or Action to which such indemnification payment is
directly or indirectly related.

Seller shall have breached any of their representations, warranties, covenants

Date after the giving of written notice by the Seller specifying such breach;

 

(c) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred by July 31, 2016 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(c)_
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

(f) by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser.

SECTION 11.04. _Public Announcements_. Each party acknowledges that the other
party will make a public announcement in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or about the date hereof (each such
announcement, a " _Press Release_ "), and each party will provide the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review such partys Press Release prior to
dissemination. Other than its Press Release, the Seller shall not make, or
cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate
with any news media without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, except
as required by Law, in which case the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with
a reasonable opportunity to review such communication prior to
its dissemination.

SECTION 11.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof (including the Letter of Intent).

 

SECTION 11.07. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of
the Seller or the

 



62  Purchaser, as applicable) and any such assignment or attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may assign all or any portion of this Agreement to one or more
Affiliates of the Purchaser without the consent of the Seller, _provided_ that
any such assignment by the Purchaser shall not relieve the Purchaser of any
Liability or obligation hereunder.

 

SECTION 11.08. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each of
the Parties or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 11.09_.

SECTION 11.09. _Waiver_. Any Party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party contained herein or in any document delivered by any other Party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of any
other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

SECTION 11.10. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of
_Article IX_ relating to indemnified parties, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, including any
union or any employee or former employee of the Seller, any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of
employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any Party could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which
any Party may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary
damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
any of the provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or other
undertaking.

SECTION 11.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts

 



63  executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the
state courts of Delaware sitting in New Castle County, Delaware. Consistent
with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state court sitting in New Castle County,
Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts.

SECTION 11.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 11.13_.

SECTION 11.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or portable document format (".pdf")) in
one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 11.15. _Time of Essence_. As to all provisions of this Agreement, TIME
IS OF THE ESSENCE.

 



64 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first written above.
