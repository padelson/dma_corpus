During the 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement by Sellers' Agent,
if reasonably requested by Sellers' Agent, Buyer shall make available to
Sellers' Agent copies of the relevant documentation used in its calculation of
the U.S. Final Closing Purchase Price and the Canadian Final Closing Purchase
Price; provided, however, that, in the event Buyer, the Buyer Acquisition
Entities, or the Acquired Companies (as the case may be) do not provide any
such relevant documentation relating to the calculations underlying the U.S.
Final Closing Purchase Price and the Canadian Final Closing Purchase Price
that are reasonably requested by Sellers' Agent within five days of request
therefor (or such shorter period of time remaining in such 30-day period),
such 30-day period shall be extended by one day for each additional day
required for Buyer, any Buyer Acquisition Entity or the Acquired Companies to

Agent shall, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a
notice (an "Objection Notice") to Buyer setting forth Sellers' objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount, the basis for
Sellers' disagreement therewith and Sellers' Agent's resulting calculation of
the amount of the U.S. Final Closing Purchase Price and/or the Canadian Final
Closing Purchase Price, as applicable. If Sellers' Agent does not deliver the
Objection Notice to Buyer within 30 days after receipt by Sellers' Agent of
the Closing Statement, the U.S. Final Closing Purchase Price and the Canadian
Final Closing Purchase Price as calculated by Buyer will be conclusively
presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will be final and binding
upon the Parties.

 

(c) Sellers' Agent and Buyer will use their respective Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the computation of the U.S. Final
Closing Purchase Price and/or the Canadian Final Closing Purchase Price, but
if they do not obtain a final resolution within 60 days after Buyer's receipt
of the Objection Notice, then all amounts remaining in dispute shall be
submitted to the Neutral Auditor; provided, however, to the extent agreed upon
by Sellers' Agent and Buyer, the 60-day period set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence may be extended. Buyer and Sellers' Agent will direct the
Neutral Auditor to render a determination within 45 days of its retention and
Buyer and Sellers' Agent will cooperate with the Neutral Auditor during its
engagement. The Neutral Auditor will consider only those items and amounts set
forth in the Objection Notice which Buyer and Sellers' Agent are unable to
resolve. Each of Buyer and Sellers' Agent shall be entitled to make a
presentation to the Neutral Auditor regarding the items and amounts that they
are unable to resolve and neither Buyer nor Sellers' Agent will meet
separately with the Neutral Auditor. In making its determination, the Neutral
Auditor shall (i) be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the definition of the U.S. Final Closing Purchase Price and/or the
Canadian Final Closing Purchase Price, as the case may be, and the components
thereof, the definition of Applicable GAAP, the Illustrative Statement, and
the terms of this SECTION 2.3, and

(ii) not assign any value with respect to a disputed amount that is greater
than the highest value for such amount claimed by either Sellers' Agent or
Buyer or that is less than the lowest value for such amount claimed by either
Sellers' Agent or Buyer. The determination of the Neutral Auditor will be
conclusive and binding. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor shall be
paid by Sellers, on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded to Seller or
Buyer, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by
Seller and Buyer.

 

(d) The "U.S. Final Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to the U.S.
Estimated Closing Purchase Price less the finally determined U.S. Final
Closing Purchase Price. The "Canadian Final Adjustment Amount" shall be an
amount equal to the Canadian Estimated Closing Purchase Price less the finally
determined Canadian Final Closing Purchase Price. Within five Business Days
following the final determination of both the U.S. Final Closing Purchase
Price and the Canadian Final Closing Purchase Price:

 

(i) if the U.S. Final Adjustment Amount is positive and less than or equal to
the U.S. Adjustment Holdback, (A) a portion of the U.S. Adjustment Holdback
equal to the U.S. Final Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the Sellers' Agent
(or Sellers shall otherwise cause such amount to be paid) to Buyer (on behalf
of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) and (B) Sellers' Agent shall pay to the
applicable Sellers, in accordance with their respective U.S. Pro Rata Shares,
the remainder, if any, of the U.S. Adjustment Holdback;

 

(ii) if the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount is positive and less than or
equal to the Canadian Adjustment Holdback, (A) a portion of the Canadian
Adjustment Holdback equal to the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount shall be
paid by the Sellers' Agent (or Sellers shall otherwise cause such amount to be
paid) to Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) and (B) Sellers'
Agent shall pay to the applicable Sellers, in accordance with their respective
Canadian Pro Rata Shares, the remainder, if any, of the Canadian Adjustment
Holdback;

 

(iii) if the U.S. Final Adjustment Amount is positive and greater than the
U.S. Adjustment Holdback, (A) the entire U.S. Adjustment Holdback shall be
paid by the Sellers' Agent (or Sellers shall otherwise cause such amount to be
paid) to Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) and (B) the
Sellers (other than Chantco) shall pay Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer
Acquisition Entities) an amount equal to the excess of the U.S. Final
Adjustment Amount over the U.S. Adjustment Holdback;

 

(iv) if the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount is positive and greater than the
Canadian Adjustment Holdback, (A) the entire Canadian Adjustment Holdback
shall be paid by Sellers' Agent (or Sellers shall otherwise cause such amount
to be paid) to Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) and (B) the
Sellers (other than Logistic Resources Group, LLC ("Logistic Resources") shall
pay Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) an amount equal to the
excess of the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount over the Canadian Adjustment
Holdback;

 

(v) if the U.S. Final Adjustment Amount is negative or zero, (A) the entire
U.S. Adjustment Holdback shall be paid by Sellers' Agent to the applicable
Sellers, in accordance with their respective U.S. Pro Rata Shares, and (B)
Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) shall pay or cause to be
paid to the applicable Sellers, in accordance with their respective U.S. Pro
Rata Shares, an amount equal to the absolute value of the U.S. Final
Adjustment Amount; or

 

(vi) if the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount is negative or zero, (A) the
entire Canadian Adjustment Holdback shall be paid by Sellers' Agent to the
applicable Sellers, in accordance with their respective Canadian Pro Rata
Shares, and (B) Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) shall pay
or cause to be paid to the applicable Sellers, in accordance with their
respective Canadian Pro Rata Shares, an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Canadian Final Adjustment Amount.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the Adjustment Holdbacks (i)
the Sellers (other than Chantco) are jointly and severally responsible for the
full and prompt payment of any U.S. Final Adjustment Amount owed to Buyer, if
any, and (ii) the Sellers (other than Logistic Resources) and Chant are
jointly and severally responsible for the full and prompt payment of any
Canadian Final Adjustment Amount to Buyer. Without limiting the rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, no adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to this SECTION 2.3 shall, in and of itself, be considered a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

 

2.4. Holdbacks.

 

(a) Holdback Amounts. To secure the indemnification and other payment
obligations of Sellers under this Agreement, Buyer shall withhold from the
Purchase Price (i) an amount equal to $6.0 million (the "Indemnification
Holdback"), and (ii) an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (A) $500,000 (the
"U.S. Adjustment Holdback") and (B) $150,000 (the "Canadian Adjustment
Holdback", and together with the U.S. Adjustment Holdback, the "Adjustment
Holdbacks"). The Adjustment Holdbacks and the Indemnification Holdback are
collectively referred to herein as the "Holdback Amounts". Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement (including in ARTICLE 8), (i) the
appropriate Adjustment Holdbacks will be the first source of funds used to
fund the obligation, if any, of the Sellers to pay any U.S. Final Adjustment
Amount or Canadian Final Adjustment Amount to Buyer or

 



 

    |

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 6

  
 

   

Canadian Newco, as the case may be, and (ii) the Indemnification Holdback will
be the first source of funds accessed by Buyer for the Sellers'
indemnification and other payment obligations, if any, under this Agreement,
but in each case such Holdback Amounts will not be the sole source of funds
for such obligations, and Buyer will remain entitled to the full amounts owed
to Buyer under this Agreement (if any) should the Holdback Amounts be
insufficient or unavailable to cover any amount so owed.

 

(b) Adjustment Holdback. Sellers' Agent shall hold the Adjustment Amounts
pending the final determination of the U.S. Final Adjustment Amount and the
Canadian Final Adjustment Amount, at which time the Adjustment Holdbacks shall
be paid by Sellers' Agent to the Sellers or Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer
Acquisition Entities) only as expressly provided in SECTION 2.3(d). Prior to
such payment of the Adjustment Holdbacks, Sellers' Agent shall hold the
Adjustment Holdbacks in a segregated account, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, and shall invest the Adjustment Holdback only in the following
permitted investments: (i) direct obligations of the United States of America
or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally
guaranteed by the United States of America, (ii) U.S. dollar denominated money
market deposit accounts or certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank
and trust company, or national banking association, which such deposits are
either (A) insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a similar
governmental agency, or (B) with domestic commercial banks which have a rating
on their short- term certificates of deposit on the date of purchase of "A-1"
or "A-l+" by SandP or "P-1" by Moody's and maturing no more than 90 days after
the date of purchase (ratings on holding companies are not considered as the
rating of the bank); (iii) repurchase agreements having daily liquidity with
any bank, trust company, or national banking association, whose short-term
debt ratings are not less than A-1/P-1 and whose long-term debt ratings are
not less than AA; or (iv) money market funds rated AAA/Aaa that invest
primarily in United States Treasury instruments or instruments issued by
agencies of the United States government. Without limiting the provisions of
SECTION 10.2, (i) all such investments shall be at the risk of the Sellers and
Chant, (ii) in no event shall the Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee be responsible
for the handling of the Adjustment Holdbacks by the Sellers' Agent, and (iii)
the Sellers and Chant acknowledge they shall not be relieved of their
responsibility to pay the full amount of any amounts due to Buyer under
SECTION 2.3 regardless of the performance of Sellers' Agent or the
availability of the Adjustment Holdbacks.

 

(c) Indemnification Holdback. On the Termination Date, Buyer shall distribute
to the Sellers, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount
(if any) equal to the Indemnification Holdback, minus (i) the amount of all
indemnification and other payment claims for which Buyer was entitled to
indemnification or payment under this Agreement as of such date, minus (ii)
any Pending Claim Amounts that have not been resolved prior to such date, plus
(iii) Applicable Interest upon the portion of the Indemnification Holdback
then payable. Each Seller shall be paid his, her or its Pro Rata Share of any
remaining Indemnification Holdback by Buyer promptly, but in no event later
than ten Business Days following the Termination Date. Any portion of the
Indemnification Holdback retained by Buyer with respect to a Pending Claim
Amount (less any portion to which Buyer was entitled to indemnification or
payment under this Agreement), plus Applicable Interest thereon, shall be paid
to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares promptly,
but in no event later than ten Business Days following the final disposition
of such Pending Claim Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer is not
required to segregate any monies from its general funds, to create any trust
or to make any special deposits with respect to the Indemnification Holdback.

denominator of which is 10% of the applicable Performance Objective,
multiplied by (2) $1,666,666.66; or (C) if the Achievement Percentage for such

be made for such Earn-Out Period).

two Annual Earn-Out Periods, the Annual Earn-Out Base Amount for such Annual
Earn-Out Period and (B) with respect to the third Annual Earn-Out Period, the

management incentive plan as in effect from time to time) on the Sales Revenue
for the Three-Year Earn-Out Period and the denominator of which is the amount
of Sales Revenue for the Three-Year Earn-Out Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, the calculation of EBITDA Margin will include Integrated Revenue only

and G2S on the relevant financial statements such that Buyer determines it is
not reasonably possible to segregate the revenue of Liberty Bell and G2S, on
the one hand, from the net revenue of such acquired businesses or entities
("Integrated Revenue"), (B) exclude net revenue attributable to other
businesses of Buyer and its Subsidiaries or any other Person, including other

Percentage for the Three-Year Earn-Out Period exceeds 105% but is less than or
equal to 110%, an amount equal to the product of $1,000,000 multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which Sales Revenue for the
Three-Year Earn-Out Period exceeded 105% of the Performance Objective for the
Three-Year Earn-Out Period and the denominator of which is 5% of the
applicable Performance Objective; or

 

(E) if the EBITDA Margin is less than 6.25%, or if the Achievement Percentage
for the Three-Year Earn-Out Period is less than or equal to 105%, zero (no
Earn-Out Payment shall be made for the Three-Year Earn-Out Period).

 

(xiii) "Three-Year Earn-Out Period" means the three-year period ending
December 31, 2017.

 

(b) Earn-Out Schedules. Within 60 days following the end of each Earn-Out
Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers' Agent a schedule of the
Sales Revenue, Performance Objective, Achievement Percentage and, with respect
to the Three-Year

Earn-Out Period only, the EBITDA Margin, Cumulative Calculation and Catch-Up
Amount, for such Earn-Out Period (an "Earn-Out Schedule"), setting forth such
calculations in reasonable detail and the resulting Earn-Out Payments for such
Earn-Out Period. Within 30 days after delivery of an Earn-Out Schedule to
Sellers' Agent (during which period Buyer shall provide reasonable access to
such working papers and information relating to the preparation of the Earn-
Out Schedule as may be reasonably requested by Sellers' Agent), Sellers' Agent
may dispute all or a portion of the Earn-Out Schedule by giving written notice
(a "Earn-Out Objection Notice") to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for any such dispute; provided, however, with respect to the Three-
Year Earn-Out Period, Sellers' Agent may not dispute any portion of the Earn-
Out Schedule relating to previously completed Earn-Out Periods which is
consistent with the Earn-Out Schedule which has become conclusive, final and
binding for such Earn-Out Period. Buyer and Sellers' Agent shall promptly
commence good faith negotiations with a view to resolving all such disputes.
If Sellers' Agent does not provide an Earn-Out Objection Notice to Buyer
within such 30-day period, the Earn-Out Schedule in the form delivered by
Buyer will be conclusive, final and binding. If Buyer and Sellers' Agent do
not resolve such dispute (as evidenced by a written agreement between them, in
which case the Earn-Out Schedule as so agreed will be conclusive, final and
binding) within 30 days following delivery of the Earn-Out Objection Notice,
the dispute may be resolved in accordance with the provisions of SECTION
2.3(c), mutatis mutandis, and the Earn-Out Schedule as so resolved will be
conclusive, final and binding.

 

(c) Payment. Subject to SECTION 8.9, within five Business Days following the
date the Earn-Out Schedule for an Earn-Out Period becomes conclusive, final
and binding, the Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Acquisition Entities) shall pay
or cause to be paid the Earn-Out Payment, if any, for such Earn-Out Period to
Sellers in accordance with SECTION 2.1(e). Of each Earn-Out Payment, (i)
27.24% shall be allocated to the Canadian Purchase Price (the "Canadian Earn-
Out Payments") and (ii) 72.76% shall be allocated directly to the U.S.
Purchase Price (the "U.S. Earn-Out Payments"). For avoidance of doubt, the
Earn-Out Payments will not exceed $10 million in the aggregate.

 

(d) Operation of Business. Buyer shall not take any action the sole purpose of
which is to frustrate the ability of the Sellers to receive the Earn-Out
Payments as contemplated by this SECTION 2.5. Buyer will have the right to
operate the business of the Acquired Companies as it chooses, in its sole
discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer is not
under any obligation to provide any specific level of investment or financial
assistance to any Acquired Company or to undertake any specific actions (or to
refrain from taking any specific actions) with respect to the operation of any
Acquired Company and may acquire, create, own or operate other businesses
(including similar businesses) and none of such actions or inactions shall be
deemed to be taken for the purpose of frustrating the ability of Sellers to
receive the Earn-Out Payments. Buyer is not representing or warranting that
any specific level of Sales Revenue or EBITDA Margin will be achieved nor will
Sellers' Agent, Sellers or any of their Affiliates have any claims against
Buyer, any Buyer Acquisition Entity, any Acquired Company or any of their
Affiliate arising from the failure to meet for any reason any specific level
of Sales Revenue or EBITDA Margin.

 

(e) Nature of Earn-Out. The right to receive any Earn-Out Payment is an
integral part of the U.S. Purchase Price and the Canadian Purchase Price. The
right to receive any Earn-Out Payment does not represent an equity or
ownership interest in Buyer or any Acquired Company, does not entitle the
holder thereof to any rights (including voting, dividend or other rights)
other than the right to receive any Earn-Out Payment as expressly set forth in
this SECTION 2.5, and is not a "security" within the meaning of the Securities
Act or any other securities laws. The right to receive any Earn-Out Payment
will not be represented by any form of certificate or instrument and is not
assignable or transferable, except by operation of law. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer is not required to segregate any monies from its general funds to
create any trust or to make any special deposits with respect to any Earn-Out
Payment.

thereto). Since the date of the applicable Most Recent Balance Sheet, no
Acquired Company has incurred any Liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in Applicable GAAP,
outside the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past custom and
practice.

Code Section 361.

 

(i) Since the date of the applicable Most Recent Financial Statements, no
Acquired Company has made or changed any election, changed an annual
accounting period, adopted or changed any accounting method, filed any amended
Tax Return, entered into any closing agreement, settled any Tax claim or

(k) Each Acquired Company is duly and properly registered in each country or
territory where required for value added tax, goods and services taxes, Quebec
sales tax and any other equivalent local or regional Taxes for which
registration is required, and each Acquired Company has timely and accurately
complied at all times with the Applicable Laws governing such registrations.
The books and records of each applicable Acquired Company fairly and correctly
set out and disclose, in all material respects, all liabilities and unclaimed
input Tax credits under the ETA for purposes of the goods and services or
harmonized sales tax and any unclaimed credits or refunds under An Act
respecting the Quebec sales tax.

 

(l) No Acquired Company is or has been treated as resident in or having
permanent establishment (including by or through employees, independent
contractors or other service or representative relationship or by or through
any facilities or places of business available to any Acquired Company or any
of its employees or contractors) in any jurisdiction other than the United
States (in the case of each Acquired Company other than G2S) or the Canadian
provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Alberta (in the case of G2S).

during its existence. Each of Liberty Bell, Label and XLC has made valid
elections to be Taxed in a comparable fashion under comparable state,
provincial, municipal, local or foreign Tax law, for the Taxable periods and
in the Taxing jurisdictions listed in Disclosure Schedule 4.12(o). Disclosure
Schedule 4.12(o) also lists any Subsidiary of Liberty Bell, Label or XLC that
is a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of Tax Code
Section 1361(b)(3)(B), and each Subsidiary so listed has been such a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary at all times since the corresponding date listed in
Disclosure Schedule 4.12(o).

 

(p) Neither Liberty Bell, Label nor XLC has incurred or become liable for the
payment of any Tax under Tax Code Section 1374 (including relating to "built-
in gain") and neither Liberty Bell, Label nor XLC will incur or become liable
for such Tax by reason of any Transaction. None of Liberty Bell, Label, XLC or
their qualified subchapter S subsidiaries has (1) acquired assets from any
other corporation in a transaction in which the Tax basis for the acquired
assets was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the Tax basis of
the acquired assets (or any other property) of the transferor or (2) acquired
the stock of any corporation that is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary.

 

(q) No material amount of assets or properties of any Acquired Company is
escheatable to any Governmental Authority under any Applicable Law, including
uncashed checks to vendors, customers, or employees, non-refunded over
payments, credits, unused gift certificates or unused prepaid accounts.

the Sellers, G2S has not acquired property or services from or disposed of
property or provided services to, a person with whom it does not deal at Arm's

or services and has not been deemed to have done so under the ITA.

property and interests in real property leased or occupied by the Acquired
Companies, or which any Acquired Company has the right to occupy, now or in
the future (each such lease or agreement to occupy real property being
hereinafter referred to as a "Lease," and the real properties specified in
such Leases being referred to hereinafter as the "Leased Real Property"). The
Acquired Companies have delivered to Buyer a true and complete copy of each
Lease, and in the case of any oral Lease, a written summary of the material

are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to
perform its obligations hereunder, or to consummate the Transactions.

 

5.3. Non-contravention. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,

accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or require any notice under any
Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of
its assets are subject.

 

5.4. Brokers' Fees. Neither Buyer nor any other Buyer Acquisition Entity has

with respect to the Transactions for which Sellers could become liable or
obligated.

officers, directors or employees in their capacities as such (a) is subject to
any outstanding Legal Restriction or (b) is a party to, or, to Buyer's
knowledge, is threatened to be made a party to, any Legal Action by or before
any Governmental Authority in each case which would reasonably be expected to

Companies and their Subsidiaries and their respective business, assets,
properties and operations and acknowledges that each of Buyer and each other
Buyer Acquisition Entity and their respective directors, officers, managers,
partners, employees, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and
agents (collectively, the "Buyer Representatives") has, to Buyer's knowledge,
been provided access to the assets, properties, books, Material Contracts,
commitments, records (including Tax Returns and records, but excluding any
personnel information or other information protected by Applicable Laws) and
personnel of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries for this purpose to
the extent Buyer and other Buyer Acquisition Entity have deemed necessary or
appropriate. In entering into this Agreement and in making its determination
to proceed with the Transactions, each of Buyer and any Buyer Acquisition
Entity has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement and in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and Buyer and any Buyer
Acquisition Entity are not relying and have not relied on any other
representations and warranties, express or implied. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Buyer and any Buyer Acquisition Entity
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies or their
Subsidiaries, or their respective directors, officers, managers, employees,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives or agents makes or has
made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any of the books, Contracts, commitments, records,
materials or information provided or made available to Buyer, each other Buyer
Acquisition Entity or the Buyer Representatives, including with respect to any
projections, estimates or budgets concerning any future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Acquired Companies or
their Subsidiaries. Buyer and each Buyer Acquisition Entity acknowledge and
agree that no Person has been authorized by the Acquired Companies or their
Subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty regarding or relating to
the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with
the Transactions and, if made, any such representation or warranty may not be
relied upon as having been authorized by Sellers, the Acquired Companies or
their Subsidiaries, except for the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 

5.8. Investment Canada Act. Buyer is a non-Canadian within the meaning of the
Investment Canada Act.

Schedules 3.2, 3.3, or 4.4 and any other consents that Buyer may reasonably
believe necessary for the post-Closing operation of the Business, and Buyer

Equity Purchase Agreement

or requests for approval pursuant to each applicable Non-US Competition Law.
Buyer will pay the filing and submission fees under the HSR Act. Thereafter,
each Party will submit and otherwise provide any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to and in compliance with such
Applicable Laws. Each Party will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the
other any necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
necessary under such Applicable Laws. Each Party will keep the other Parties
reasonably informed, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, of the status

information from, the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority, and will
use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly comply with any such
inquiry or request.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.1(b), to
the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, each Party shall,
in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.1(b) to obtain all
requisite Governmental Approvals, terminations of waiting periods for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Applicable Laws relating to antitrust and competition matters, use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC,
DOJ or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting
or conference with, the FTC, DOJ or any such other Governmental Authority,
(iv) give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such

of any memoranda, white papers, filings, presentations, correspondence, or
other written communications explaining or defending the transactions
contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument,
and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority, in each case using Commercially Reasonable Efforts to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(d) If any Legal Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any Transaction under the HSR Act, Non-US Competition Law or
similar Applicable Law, each of the Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Action and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any related Legal Restriction, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transaction, with the Parties each
bearing their own costs; provided, however, the Sellers, on the one hand, and
the Buyer on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the costs of any
expert that Buyer and Sellers' Agent mutually agree to hire. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this SECTION 6.1(d) or otherwise shall require Buyer
or its Affiliates to propose, negotiate, effect or agree to (i) sell, hold,
divest, discontinue, license, dispose or limit, before or after the Closing
Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) otherwise take any action that limits
the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain any of the
businesses (including the Business), product lines or assets of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), or (iii) any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

6.2. Pre-Closing Conduct of Business. Except as expressly contemplated herein

unreasonably delayed, withheld, or conditioned), from the date hereof through
Closing, Sellers (1) will cause the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries

6.3. Access to Information.

 

(a) Pre-Closing Access for Buyer. From the date hereof through Closing,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Sellers will (i) furnish (or cause
to be furnished) to Buyer and Buyer's representatives (including its legal
counsel and accountants) books and records, additional financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Business as Buyer reasonably
requests, and (ii) permit (or cause the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries to permit) Buyer and Buyer's representatives (including its legal
counsel and accountants) to have reasonable access to all premises,
properties, personnel, books and records, properties, contracts and other
documents relating to the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries, subject
to any requirements of Applicable Laws regarding privacy. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) shall affect, add to or subtract from any
warranties of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
to effect the Transactions. Buyer and Buyer's representatives will conduct
such investigation and be granted such access after reasonable notice in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Pre-Closing Real Property Access for Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing
Section 6.3(a), the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Buyer does not
currently intend to conduct environmental testing or any invasive or intrusive
testing (i.e., activities requiring excavations, borings, drilling, removal or
demolition of any portion of the Leased Real Property or Improvements)
(collectively, "Invasive Testing"). In the event Buyer desires to conduct any
Invasive Testing prior to the Closing, the Parties shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to reach mutual agreement regarding the conditions for such
Invasive Testing (including the provision of indemnification and/or insurance
to adequately protect the Acquired Companies and reasonable limitations on the
conduct of such Invasive Testing).

 

(c) Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer
of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of Sellers contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, or (ii) any material failure of Sellers to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by them under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Buyer or its Affiliates or the
conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing.

 

(d) Post-Closing Access for Sellers.

 

(i) Until the later of (i) the extinguishment of the statute of limitations
for assessment of Taxes related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) the
completion of any Tax audits or Tax contests involving a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, subject to Buyer's reasonable confidentiality precautions, Buyer will,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice from Sellers: (1)
cause Sellers' Agent and his representatives to have reasonable access to the
pre-Closing books and records (including financial and Tax records, Tax
Returns, files, papers and related items) of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries, and to the appropriate personnel responsible for preparing and
maintaining such books and records, in each case to the extent (and only to
the extent) reasonably necessary to (A) defend or pursue any third party Legal
Action, (B) defend Third-Party Claim indemnification matters hereunder, (C)
prepare or audit financial statements, (D) prepare or file Tax Returns, (E)
respond to any investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of any
Governmental Authority, or (F) address other pre-Closing Tax, accounting,
financial or legal matters; and (2) permit Sellers' Agent and his
representatives to make copies of such books and records for the foregoing
purposes.

 

(ii) Any exercise by Sellers' Agent and his representatives of the rights set
forth in this Section 6.3(d) shall be at Sellers' sole cost and expense and at
Sellers' sole risk. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates shall be required to provide any access, assistance or cooperation
to the extent providing such access, assistance or cooperation would unduly
interfere with the business or operations of any of Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or

 



 

    |   
---|--- 
   

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 32

  
 

   

would, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer or its Affiliates, violate or
jeopardize any applicable attorney-client or other privilege or any applicable
contractual confidentiality obligation.

 

6.4. Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
actions are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further actions (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other
Party may reasonably request, all at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Article 8). Sellers acknowledge and agree that from and after
the Closing, Buyer will be entitled to possession of all documents, books,
records (including Tax records), agreements and financial data of any sort
relating to the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries.

 

6.5. Transition. Covenant Sellers will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
refer all customer inquiries relating to the Business to Acquired Companies
from and after the Closing through the Termination Date.

 

6.6. Confidentiality. Covenant Sellers will treat and hold as such all of the
Confidential Information, refrain from using any of the Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to
Buyer or destroy, at the option of Covenant Sellers, all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of the Confidential Information that are in their possession,
except for a securely maintained electronically archived copy the return or
destruction of which is not practicable. In the event that Covenant Sellers
are requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential
Information, Covenant Sellers will (to the extent not prohibited by law)
notify Buyer reasonably promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer
may seek (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.5. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Covenant Sellers
are, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, Covenant
Sellers may disclose only such Confidential Information to the tribunal;
provided, however, that Covenant Sellers will use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost
and expense), an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer will designate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Covenant
Sellers shall be permitted to make disclosures concerning the Confidential
Information (x) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any Tax
Return filed by Covenant Sellers of Affiliates of such Covenant Sellers, (y)
to the extent such information was or becomes available to such Covenant
Seller from a third party who is not known to such Covenant Seller to be bound
by an obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto, and (z) to the
extent reasonably required during the course of pursuing or defending in good
faith indemnification claims (or the matters underlying such indemnification
claims) or in connection with any dispute between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Covenant Sellers or Sellers' Agent, on the other. The foregoing provisions
will not apply to any Confidential Information that is generally available to
the public immediately prior to the time of disclosure unless such
Confidential Information is so available due to the wrongful actions of
Covenant Sellers. Covenant Sellers shall cause Liberty Bell to terminate the
Confidentiality Agreement as of the Closing.

 

6.7. Covenant Not to Compete and Related Covenants. To further ensure that
Buyer and any other Buyer Acquisition Entities receive the expected benefits
of acquiring the Interests, each of the Covenant Sellers hereby agree as
follows:

 

(a) During the Non-Compete Period, the Covenant Sellers will not, whether on
their own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, directly
or indirectly solicit or assist in soliciting, in competition with the
Business within the geographic regions in which any of the Acquired Companies
or their Subsidiaries then engage in such Business (the "Restricted Area"),
any Person:

 

(i) with whom the applicable Covenant Seller had personal contact or dealings
on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries during the
two-year period immediately preceding the Closing Date;

 

(ii) with whom employees directly reporting to the applicable Covenant Seller
have had personal contact or dealings with on behalf of any of the Acquired
Companies or their Subsidiaries during the two-year period immediately
preceding the Closing Date; or

 

(iii) for whom the applicable Covenant Seller had direct or indirect
supervisory responsibility during the two-year period immediately preceding
the Closing Date.

 

(b) During the Non-Compete Period (and, except with respect to the business of
the Acquired Companies, during the period between the date hereof and the
Closing), the Covenant Sellers will not, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) Engage in the business of merchandising, marketing, warehousing, selling
or distributing PBE or tools and equipment to the automotive aftermarket in
the United States or Canada or any other business that is competitive to the
Business (each, a "Competitive Business");

 



 

    |   
---|--- 
   

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 33

  
 

   

(ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to, any Competitive Business;

 

(iii) acquire a financial interest in, or otherwise become actively involved
with, any Competitive Business, directly or indirectly, as an individual,
partner, shareholder, officer, director, principal, agent, trustee, or
consultant; or

 

(iv) interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, business relationships
between any of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates or Subsidiaries and
their customers, suppliers, manufacturers, licensors, vendors, lessors or
investors.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Covenant
Sellers may, directly or indirectly, own, solely as a passive investment,
securities of any Person engaged in the Business that are listed on a national
securities exchange or publicly traded on the over-the-counter market if such
Covenant Seller (i) is not an Affiliate of or a member of a group which
controls such Person; and (ii) does not, directly or indirectly, own five
percent or more of any class of securities of such Person.

 

(d) During the Non-Compete Period, the Covenant Sellers will not, whether on
their own behalf or on behalf of any Person, directly or indirectly, solicit
or encourage any employee of any of the Acquired Companies or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective successors or assigns to leave
such employment; provided, however, that this restriction shall not be
prohibitive of any general solicitation that is not specifically targeted at
such persons.

 

(e) During the Non-Compete Period, the Covenant Sellers will not, whether on
their own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, directly
or indirectly, hire any employee who was employed by any of the Acquired
Companies or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates as of the Closing Date or who
left the employment of any of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates within six months prior to the Closing Date, unless an Acquired
Company has terminated the employment of such Person subsequent to the Closing
Date.

 

(f) During the Non-Compete Period, the Covenant Sellers will not, directly or
indirectly, request or encourage any consultant then under contract with any
of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to cease to work
with any of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates;.

 

(g) In the event a Covenant Seller violates any of the provisions contained in
this Section 6.7, the Covenant Sellers understand and agree that the breaching
Covenant Seller will be liable to Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their
Affiliates for any damage caused by such Covenant Seller's violation,
including attorney fees and expenses. In addition to any other relief
available to the Acquired Companies in event of a breach, the Acquired
Companies may obtain equitable relief in the form of temporary and permanent
injunction and, where applicable, damages at law. Such damages may be set-off
against amounts otherwise due to such Covenant Seller from any of Buyer, the
Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective
successor and assigns.

 

(h) It is expressly understood and agreed that although the Covenant Sellers
consider the restrictions contained in this Section 6.7 to be reasonable, if a
final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that
the time or territory of any restriction or provision contained in this
Section 6.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement is unenforceable against any
Covenant Seller, such provisions of this Agreement will not be rendered void
but will be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory
and/or such maximum extent as such court may determine or indicate to be
enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that
any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such
restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding will
not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained
herein.

 

6.8. Tax Matters. The following provisions will govern certain Tax matters as
between Buyer and Sellers:

 

(a) Filing Responsibility. Sellers will, through representatives of their
choosing and at their sole expense, cause the Acquired Companies to timely
prepare all income Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries for Tax Periods that begin before Closing and end on or before
the Closing Date, and any income Tax Return for a Straddle Period, and Buyer
will cause the Acquired Companies to file such Tax Returns as prepared unless
Buyer reasonably objects to a position taken on such Tax Return. If Buyer and
Sellers' Agent cannot agree on the resolution of such objection, either party
may submit such dispute to the Neutral Auditor, who shall resolve such dispute
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.3(c) (mutatis
mutandis), and Buyer shall file the Tax Return as amended to reflect the
Neutral Auditor's decision on the disputed items. Such Tax Returns will be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior income Tax Returns, except that the
income Tax Returns for the period that ends on the Closing Date will reflect
338(h)(10) Elections and deductible expenses attributable to the sale of
Liberty Bell, Label and XLC, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Buyer may not object to the allocation of Purchase Price as provided in
Section 6.8(h). Subject to Section 6.8(c), Buyer will prepare and timely file
(or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all other Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries required to be filed after the
Closing Date (after taking into account extensions therefor). Buyer shall not,
and shall not permit or cause an Acquired Company to file an amended Tax
Return, or file a Tax Return in a

jurisdiction in which the applicable Acquired Company has not filed a Tax
Return, both with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless required by
Applicable Law, without the prior written consent of the Seller's Agent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) Cooperation. Buyer and Sellers will, and each Party will cause its
applicable Affiliates to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect to
Tax matters and provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested by the other Party to respond to Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax
proceedings and to otherwise satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation also
will include promptly forwarding copies (to the extent related thereto) of (1)
relevant Tax notices, forms, filings, schedules, reports or other
communications received from or sent to any Governmental Authority (whether or
not requested), and (2) reasonably requested copies of all relevant Tax
Returns together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents
relating to rulings, audits or other Tax determinations by any Governmental
Authority and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property.
Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party with
all information that the requesting Party may be required to report under Tax
Code Sections 6043 or 6043A or the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(c) Payment of Taxes and Refunds. Buyer will satisfy (or cause to be
satisfied) in full when due all Taxes of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries with respect to any period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
If Buyer is required under Section 6.8(a) to file a Tax Return that involves
Pre-Closing Taxes, then no later than 10 Business Days before the filing of
any such Tax Return, Sellers will pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount
of Taxes shown due on such Tax Return for which Seller is obligated with
respect to such Tax Return. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers will only
be liable for any such Taxes described in this Section 6.8(c) to the extent
that such Taxes exceed the sum of (A) the amount, if any, of estimated Taxes
paid for such Taxes on or before the Closing Date plus (B) the amount, if any,
accrued for such Taxes reflected in the Closing Statement. Any refund of Taxes
(including deposits made with the IRS for the use of a non-calendar Tax year)
received with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and not reflected in the
calculation of Working Capital shall be for the benefit of Sellers and shall
be promptly delivered to Sellers upon receipt.

 

(d) Straddle Periods. In the case of any Straddle Period: (i) any real,
personal and intangible property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Straddle Period shall be equal to the amount of such property
taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the
period prior to Closing and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period of the Straddle Period shall be determined based on an actual
closing of the books used to calculate such Taxes as if such tax period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(e) Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer will bear all Transfer Taxes on a 50-50
basis, and Seller and Buyer will cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of
Applicable Law relating thereto.

 

(f) Tax-Sharing Agreements. Sellers will terminate all Tax-sharing agreements
and similar arrangements with respect to any Acquired Company or any of their
Subsidiaries before or as of the Closing Date to the extent required to cause
no Acquired Company or any of their Subsidiaries to be bound therefor or have
any Liability thereunder after the Closing Date.

 

(g) 338(h)(10) Elections. Sellers and Buyer will make the election pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of Liberty
Bell, Label and XLC, and, if permissible, similar elections under any
applicable state, municipal, local or Income Tax laws, as Buyer may reasonably
specify (collectively, the "338(h)(10) Elections"). Sellers will not, and
Sellers will cause each of Liberty Bell, Label and XLC not to, before Closing,
(1) revoke Liberty Bell's, Label's or XLC's election to be taxed as an S
corporation within the meaning of Tax Code Sections 1361 and 1362 or (2) take
any action that would result in the termination of Liberty Bell's, Label's or
XLC's status as a validly existing S corporation within the meaning of Tax
Code Sections 1361 and 1362. Buyer and all Sellers who own equity interests of
Liberty Bell, Label or XLC each will deliver to the other Party at Closing
duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the 338(h)(10) Elections and will
file such forms in accordance with applicable rules and Law. Sellers will not,
and will cause G2S not to, before Closing, make an election to be treated as
other than a partnership for US tax purposes.

 

(h) Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price, as allocated to each
Acquired Company pursuant to Section 2.1(d) above, will be allocated among the
assets of each such Acquired Company in accordance with the principles set
forth on Schedule 6.8(h). The Parties will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, make consistent use of such allocation for all Tax purposes.
With respect to such allocation, as so adjusted, each Party will (1) be bound
by such allocation, (2) act in accordance with such allocation in the
preparation of all financial statements and the filing of all Tax Returns and
in the course of any Tax audit, Tax review or other Tax Legal Action relating
thereto, (3) take no position and cause its Affiliates to take no position
inconsistent with such allocation for Tax purposes (including in connection
with any Proceeding), unless in each case otherwise required pursuant to a

"determination" within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a), and (4) not later
than 30 days before the filing of its IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 (whether initial
or supplemental) relating to the Transactions, deliver to the other Party a
true, correct and complete copy of such IRS Forms.

 

6.9. Retention of Records. Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries to retain, until all applicable Tax statutes of limitations
(including periods of waiver) have expired, all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries in
existence on the Closing Date that are required to be retained under current
retention policies and to make the same available after the Closing Date
subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6.3(d). Sellers agree that such
records will be kept strictly confidential and used only for tax purposes.

 

6.10. Exclusivity. From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and
such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.6,
Covenant Sellers will not, and will cause each of the Acquired Companies,
their Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, through any representative or otherwise (a) solicit, or entertain
offers from, negotiate with or in any manner initiate, encourage the
submission of, discuss, accept or consider any inquiry, contact, proposal or
offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of any equity interests or
other securities, or any substantial portion of the assets or business, of any
of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries (including any acquisition
structured as a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or otherwise) (a
"Takeover Proposal") or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in,
or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Company will notify Buyer of any such inquiry,
contact, proposal, or offer as soon as possible (but in any event within 24
hours of receipt or awareness thereof). At the request of Buyer, Sellers
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries to,
require any Person who has previously received Confidential Information from
any Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with any of the
foregoing to return or destroy such information.

 

6.11. Related Party Matters.

 

(a) Shareholder Agreements. Each Covenant Seller, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates, as applicable, hereby waives all rights arising
under each of the Shareholder Agreements in connection with the entry by some
or all Covenant Sellers into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
consummation of the Transactions, including all come-along and tag-along
rights, all rights of co-sale and redemption, all rights of first refusal,

Further, Covenant Sellers shall cause each of the contracts with respect to
any Capital Stock of any Acquired Company or any of their Subsidiaries

proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to any such Capital
Stock, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include each of the
Shareholder Agreements) to be terminated prior to the Closing without any
consideration payable by, or further liability or obligation of or to, Buyer,
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
and the form and substance of each agreement or instrument pursuant to which
such termination is affected shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.

 

(b) Related Party Leases. Sellers will cause the amendments to the Related
Party Leases attached as Exhibit A (the "Lease Amendments") to be duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto prior to the Closing,
and will deliver true and correct copies to Buyer.

 

6.12. Employee Benefit Plan Matters. Prior to Closing, Sellers will, and will
cause the Acquired Companies to, terminate all Employee Benefit Plans listed
on Schedule 6.12 as of no later than immediately prior to the Closing
including adopting the relevant resolutions and necessary amendments to
Employee Benefit Plans (including 100% vesting of any Employee Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under the Tax Code Section 401(a)), making
contributions to Employee Benefit Plans for all payroll periods ending prior
to Closing to the extent such contributions are due, fully accruing for all
other contribution obligations as current liabilities, and making all benefit
payments in accordance with, and by the time required under, the terms of the
Employee Benefit Plans and any other contractual obligations of the Acquired
Companies and Applicable Law.

from directly or indirectly asserting or commencing (or causing to be

recovery from any Covenant Seller on behalf of or in the name of any of the
Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries based upon a claim of a breach of
fiduciary duty or corporate waste that has arisen or arises out of or relates
to an action or event occurring or existing prior to the Closing
(collectively, the "Released Claims"). Effective as of the Closing, each of
the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries hereby fully and irrevocably
waives, releases and discharges forever each Covenant Seller from any Released
Claims, and each of the Seller Indemnitors hereby fully and irrevocably waive,
release and discharge forever each other and each of the Acquired Companies
and their Subsidiaries and any other Buyer Indemnitees from any Released
Claims (or derivative claims related thereto). The Seller Indemnitors hereby
represent, warrant and covenant that, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no such
Released Claims exist as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 6.13 shall not apply
to, and the Released Claims shall not include, (x) any claims, rights or other
actions arising out of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other
Contract or (y) any right or claims that may arise as a result of an action or
event occurring after the Closing.

afforded to such Seller Indemnitee pursuant to the bylaws or other governing
or constituting documents of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or
any similar indemnification or contribution right with respect to any amounts
paid by any Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Section 2.3 or ARTICLE 8.

 

6.14. Payment of Employee Bonuses. Buyer shall cause Liberty Bell to pay all
employee bonuses as described on DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 6.14 in the Ordinary
Course of Business; provided, that, the Acquired Companies shall fully accrue
for the pro rata portion (based on the portion of the applicable bonus period
elapsed through the Closing Date) of such employee bonuses as current
liabilities on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

 

6.15. Nevadaco Consideration Amount. The Sellers shall cause the Nevadaco
Consideration Amount to be retained by Nevadaco in cash, free and clear of
Encumbrances, through the Closing.

to contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation set

Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall not, and

provision in the Charter Documents of the Company or their Subsidiaries
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any present or former
manager, director and officer (and similar functionary) of the Acquired
Companies (each a "Covered Person") or their Subsidiaries in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
the Closing (unless required by Applicable Laws), it being the intent of the
parties that the Covered Persons shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification in accordance with their terms to the full
extent of all Applicable Laws. The provisions of this SECTION 6.16 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered
Person.

 

6.17. Real Estate Repairs.

 

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will conduct a joint inspection of each of
the Leased Real Properties (other than the Leased Real Properties subject to
the Related Party Leases) to identify all improvement, restoration, repair or
replacement obligations that, based on the current condition of such Leased
Real Properties, will be required to be performed at or by the end of the term
of the applicable Lease (collectively, the "Punchlist Items"); provided, that,
the Punchlist Items shall not include the removal of warehouse shelving or
sprinkler systems. The Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the applicable landlord for
each Leased Real Property to participate in such joint inspection and to agree
to be bound by the determination of the Punchlist Items.

 

(b) Sellers shall promptly obtain written quotes for the completion of the
Punchlist Items from qualified third party contractors that are reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and, based upon such written quotes (or, if Sellers have
been unable to obtain such quotes, based on such Parties' reasonable estimate
of the costs of such Punchlist Items), the Sellers' Agent and the Buyer shall
reasonably agree on an estimated cost for each of the Punchlist Items to be
completed. Sellers may cause the Acquired Companies to complete any or all of
the Punchlist Items prior to Closing.

(c) Sellers may cause the Punchlist Items to be completed prior to the Closing
by qualified third party contractors that are reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
provided the full cost of such work is paid in full prior to Closing. The
estimated cost, as determined pursuant to Section 6.17(b), of all Punchlist
Items that have not been completed to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction as of
the Closing shall be deducted from the Purchase Price as Closing Date
Transaction Expenses and retained by the Buyer Acquisition Entities, and,

8.3. Certain Terms and Limitations. Notwithstanding any other term herein, the

(a) Deductible. Seller Indemnitors will not have any obligation under SECTION
8.1(a), (f) and (h) (to the extent incident to SECTION 8.1(a) or (f)), in each
case other than regarding any breach of any Special Representation or
regarding any Wrongdoer Payments (as to which no deductible will apply),
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnification for which Seller
Indemnitors are obligated thereunder exceeds $2.0 million (the "Deductible"),
and then only with respect to such amount in excess of the Deductible. Buyer
will not have any obligation under SECTION 8.2(a) and (d) (to the extent
incident to SECTION 8.2(a)) other than regarding any breach of any Special
Representation (as to which no deductible will apply), unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnification for which Buyer is obligated thereunder
exceeds the Deductible, and then only with respect to such amount in excess of
the Deductible.

 

(b) Cap. The obligations of Seller Indemnitors under SECTION 8.1(a), (f) and
(h) (to the extent incident to SECTION 8.1(a) or (f)), in each case other than
regarding any breach of any Special Representation or regarding any Wrongdoer
Payments (as to which no limitation or cap will apply), in the aggregate, will
not exceed an amount equal to $11.0 million (the "Cap"). The obligations of
Buyer under SECTION 8.2(a) and (d) (to the extent incident to SECTION 8.1(a)),
in each case other than regarding any breach of any Special Representation (as
to which no limitation or cap will apply), in the aggregate, will not exceed
an amount equal to the Cap. In addition, in no event shall any Seller be
responsible for any indemnification obligation or payment obligation in excess
of the portion of the Purchase Price received by him, her or it.

 

(c) Special Provisions for Article 3. Notwithstanding SECTION 8.1 herein, if
any Seller breaches a representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE 3, that
breaching Seller and its related Seller Indemnitors shall be solely and
exclusively liable for said breach and the other Seller Indemnitors shall not
be liable to Buyer in any manner. For the purposes of this SECTION 8.3(c) and
SECTION 8.9, (i) Chant is a related Seller Indemnitor of Chantco, (ii) Alison
R. (Bell) Keim and The Bell Family Trust for Alison (Bell) Keim are each
related Seller Indemnitors of the other, (iii) Lauren R. Bell and The Bell
Family Trust for Lauren Bell are each related Seller Indemnitors of the other,
and (iv) each of Sellers other than Chantco are related Seller Indemnitors of
Logistic Resources Group.

 

(d) Special Provisions for Chant, Chantco and Logistic Resources.
Notwithstanding SECTION 8.1 herein, Chant and Chantco shall not be liable
under SECTION 8.1 for any Losses which do not in any way relate to either G2S
or any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements particular
to Chant and Chantco under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding SECTION 8.1 herein, Logistic Resources shall not be liable
under SECTION 8.1 for any Losses which in any way relate to either G2S or any
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements particular to G2S
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

(e) Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
each Party and any Person's rights to indemnification with respect thereto
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such Person (including by any of his, her or its advisors,
consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that such Person or
any of such advisors, consultants or representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate. The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based
on such representations,

 



 

    |   
---|--- 
   

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 42

  
 

   

warranties, covenants, and obligations. All representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements herein will be deemed material and relied upon by
each Party, and none will be waived by any failure to pursue any action or by
consummation of the Transactions.

 

(f) Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of this ARTICLE 8, the
representations and warranties of each Party in this Agreement (other than
SECTION 4.8(b), SECTION 4.9, SECTION 4.12(a), SECTION 4.12(q), SECTION
4.14(e), and SECTION 4.15(a)) and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto
shall be deemed not to include any Materiality Qualifiers.

 

(g) Mitigation; Insurance Proceeds. The Party seeking indemnification under
this ARTICLE 8 shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts as required by
Applicable Law to mitigate any Losses which form the basis of an
indemnification claim hereunder. The amount of any Losses incurred or suffered
by an indemnified Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated after giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually received by
such indemnified Person with respect to such Losses, minus any costs of
collection, any deductibles, the effect of any increased premiums and any
other costs resulting from making claims or recovery thereunder; provided,
however, the indemnified Person shall have no obligation to pursue such
insurance proceeds.

 

(h) No Double Recovery. No Party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any
other Person with respect to any Losses with respect to any matter if the
Losses relating to such matter were included in the calculation of the
adjustment to Purchase Price pursuant to SECTION 2.3 (to the extent, but only
the extent, so included).

 

(i) Sellers' Agent. For purposes of this ARTICLE 8, any references to the
Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to Sellers' Agent when Seller Indemnitors
are the Indemnifying Parties. Sellers' Agent shall have full power and
authority on behalf of each Seller Indemnitor to take any and all actions on
behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive
any and all rights of, Seller Indemnitors under this ARTICLE 8.

 

8.4. Certain Survival Periods.

 

(a) Representations and Warranties. Each representation and warranty contained
herein (and in any related schedule) and the obligation of the Seller
Indemnitors under SECTION 8.1(f) will survive the Closing and will remain in
full force and effect for a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, except
as follows:

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 8.4(a)(ii), each Special Representation
(and related schedule) will survive the Closing and will remain in full force
and effect indefinitely after the Closing Date. "Special Representation" means
any representation or warranty in ARTICLE 3 or in SECTION 4.1 (entitled
"Organization, Qualification, and Corporate Power"), SECTION 4.2 (entitled
"Capitalization"), SECTION 4.12 (entitled "Tax Matters"), SECTION 4.3(a), (b)
and (d) (entitled "Subsidiaries"), SECTION 4.5 (entitled "Brokers' Fees"),
SECTION 4.28 (entitled "Investment Company Act"), SECTION 4.31 (entitled
"Operations of XLC") or SECTION 5.4 (entitled "Brokers' Fees");

 

(ii) The representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.12 (entitled
"Tax Matters") shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations, including any extension thereof; and

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) any representation or
warranty fraudulently made or otherwise made with the intent to deceive or
otherwise mislead (and, in each case, any related schedule) will survive
indefinitely until all Liabilities hereunder relating thereto are barred by
all applicable statutes of limitations and (ii) any claims for Wrongdoer
Payments will survive indefinitely until all Liabilities hereunder relating
thereto are barred by all applicable statutes of limitations.

 

(b) Survival Until Final Determination. For each claim for indemnification
under this Agreement regarding a breach of a representation or warranty (or
related schedule) that is made prior to expiration of the survival period for
such representation or warranty (as set forth in SECTION 8.4(a)), such claim
and associated right to indemnification will not terminate before final
determination and satisfaction of such claim.

 

(c) Survival of Other Terms. Except as provided in the preceding terms of this
SECTION 8.4 regarding representations and warranties, each covenant or
agreement contained herein, and all associated rights under this ARTICLE 8,
will survive Closing and will continue in full force thereafter, subject to
any limitation stated by their respective terms.

 

8.5. Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) Notice. A Party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Claiming
Party") will give the Party obligated to provide such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of any claim of a third party (a "Third-
Party Claim") as to

 



 

    |   
---|--- 
   

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 43

  
 

   

which the Claiming Party has the right to demand indemnification hereunder
(the "Initial Claim Notice"). The failure to promptly give such Initial Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby,
and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

 

(b) Commencement of Defense and Participation. Promptly after receiving such
Initial Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may, in its discretion, assume
the Defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own expense and may settle such
Third-Party Claim, but will not, without the written consent of the Claiming
Party, agree to (i) any injunctive relief affecting the Claiming Party or any
of its Affiliates or (ii) any settlement that would adversely affect the
business or operations of the Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates,
including the settlement of a Third-Party Claim involving a Governmental
Authority that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided, however, that
Sellers shall have the sole right to control, defend and settle any claim
(including an audit) of any income Tax that is attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period unless such Third-Party Claim could have the impact of increased
income or decreased deductions for, or otherwise increase the Tax Liability
of, any of the Acquired Entities, Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates after Closing.

 

(c) Participation by Claiming Party. The Claiming Party will have the right to
engage its own legal counsel (and other professional advisers) in connection
with such Defense and Third-Party Claim, at the Claiming Party's expense (or
at the Indemnifying Party's expense if the Claiming Party is advised by
counsel that a conflict exists between the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying
Party in connection with such Defense and Third-Party Claim). The Indemnifying
Party will keep the Claiming Party fully informed of all matters material to
such Defense and Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof, whether or not the
Claiming Party is represented by separate legal counsel; provided, that with
respect to Third-Party Claims with respect to which Sellers have the sole
right to control pursuant to SECTION 8.5(b), Sellers will keep Buyer
reasonably informed as to the Defense and progress on any settlements.

 

(d) Failure to Commence Defense. If the Indemnifying Party does not commence a
Defense within 30 days following receipt of such Initial Claim Notice (or such
shorter period, if any, during which a Defense must be commenced for the
preservation of rights), the Claiming Party may, at its option, settle or
defend such Third-Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(e) Resolution of Third-Party Claim. Subject to the other terms of this
ARTICLE 8, if (i) a final judgment or order in favor of such third party is
rendered against the Claiming Party that is not subject to appeal or with
respect to which the time to appeal has expired without an appeal having been
made or (ii) such Third-Party Claim is settled in accordance with this ARTICLE
8 resulting in Losses on the part of the Claiming Party, then the amount of
such Losses incurred by the Claiming Party will be paid by the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(f) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
promptly make available to the other Party (and its legal counsel and other
professional advisers with a reasonable need to know) all books and records of
such Party relating to such Defense and Third-Party Claim, subject to
reasonable confidentiality requirements (including withholding any materials
subject to attorney-client or other legal privilege). Each Party will render
to the other Party such assistance as such other Party may reasonably request
to ensure the proper and adequate Defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(g) Protecting Goodwill. In conducting any Defense or dealing with any Third-
Party Claim hereunder, each Party will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
protect and preserve the reputation and goodwill associated with each other
Party.

 

8.6. Additional Notices. In addition to and not in limitation of Section 8.5,
a Claiming Party will give prompt notice to an Indemnifying Party of each
claim for indemnification hereunder for which such Claiming Party proposes to
demand indemnification (whether or not involving a third party), specifying
the amount and nature of such claim (to the extent known). The failure to
promptly give such notice to the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party
was materially prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent of such
prejudice.

 

8.7. Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that each other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any term of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached,
so that a Party will be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled, at law or
in equity. In particular, each Party recognizes and affirms that in the event
any Seller Indemnitor breaches this Agreement, money damages may be inadequate
and Buyer would have no adequate remedy at law, so that Buyer will have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
seek enforcement of its rights and each other Party's obligations hereunder
not only by action for damages but also by action for specific performance,
injunctive or other equitable relief.

8.8. Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to (a) fraud and (b) claims for
injunctive or other equitable relief, the terms in this Article 8 set forth
the sole and exclusive remedies for the matters in this Agreement, including
for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement.

 

8.9. Source of Recovery. Any amount owed by any Seller Indemnitor hereunder,
including pursuant to SECTION 2.3, SECTION 6.7, or this ARTICLE 8, shall first
be paid or set off from the applicable Holdback Amounts in accordance with
SECTION 2.4; provided, that if the amount of any Loss exceeds the amount then
remaining in the applicable Holdback Amounts, then Seller Indemnitors, subject
to the limitations contained in this ARTICLE 8, shall pay Buyer or any Buyer
Indemnitee an amount equal to such excess as soon as practicable (but in any
event within ten Business Days) after such determination. Furthermore, Buyer
may set-off and retain any amount owed by any Seller Indemnitor hereunder
against any amount payable by Buyer or its Affiliates to such Seller
Indemnitor, including the Earn-Out Payments. The exercise of or failure to
exercise such right of set off will not constitute an election of remedies or
limit in any manner the enforcement of any other remedy that may be available
to any Buyer Indemnitee.

Any Party may change the address to which such notices and communications are
to be delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner stated above.

 

9.8. Governing Law. This Agreement, and all matters, will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of law.

 

9.9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party hereby
irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in Cook County, Illinois in any proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and to the respective
court to which an appeal of the decisions of any such court may be taken. Each
Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance therein of such a
proceeding. Each Party hereby expressly waives any right it may have to a jury
trial in any such proceeding.

 

9.10. Service of Process. Any Party may make service on any other Party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.7.
Nothing in this Section 9.10, however, will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each
Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought will
be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law or at equity.

 

9.11. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
will be valid unless the same will be in writing and signed by Buyer and
Sellers' Agent. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or
any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, will be valid unless the same will be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver (or, in the case of a waiver by
Sellers, by Sellers' Agent) nor will such waiver be deemed to extend to any
prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant.

 

9.12. Severability; Blue Pencil. Any term of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If any term of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
(including any term of Section 6.7), then it is the Parties' intent that all
other terms of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and
effect, and such term automatically will be amended so that it is valid, legal
and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, but as
close to the Parties' original intent as is permissible.

 

9.13. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Parties will each bear their own costs and expenses (including legal and other
professional fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions; provided that Sellers will also bear the costs and expenses
of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries (including its legal and
other professional fees and expenses) accrued or incurred up to and including
the Closing in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

9.14. Incorporation of Exhibits, Disclosure Schedules and Schedules. The
Exhibits, Disclosure Schedules and Schedules identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

 

9.15. Nature of Disclosure Schedules; Disclosure Schedule Updates. Nothing in
the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made in this Agreement unless the Disclosure
Schedule identifies the item as an exception to such representation or
warranty; however, any information disclosed in any section number shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other section number under
this Agreement to the extent (but only the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure alone that such information is
responsive to the representations to which such other section relates. A
disclosure made by Sellers in any section of this Agreement or any Disclosure
Schedule will expressly not be deemed to

 



 

    |   
---|--- 
   

Equity Purchase Agreement

 |  

Page 47

  
 

   

constitute an admission by Sellers, or otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this
Agreement. Sellers' Agent may at any time prior to the Closing update or
supplement any Section of the Disclosure Schedules or provide a new Section
qualifying any representation or warranty of Sellers contained herein that is
not subject to the Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to any fact or condition that arises only after the date hereof and
which would have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure
Schedule (each, a "Schedule Supplement"). If such Schedule Supplement is not
