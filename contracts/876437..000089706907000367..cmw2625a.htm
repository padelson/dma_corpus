     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 6, 2007 (this "Agreement"), by and between Radian Group Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Radian"), and MGIC Investment Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation ("MGIC"). 

   

W I T N E S S E T H:

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Radian and MGIC have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which Radian will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into MGIC (the "Merger"), so that MGIC is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger; and 

   

 WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I

   

THE MERGER

   

 1.1 The Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Radian shall merge with and into MGIC. MGIC shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Radian shall terminate. 

    

 (b) The parties may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of  Radian and MGIC (including by providing for the merger of a wholly owned  subsidiary of MGIC with and into Radian, the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Radian with and into MGIC or the merger of MGIC with and into Radian) if and to the extent that Radian and MGIC deem such change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change  the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of Radian as provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger  Consideration"), except for appropriate adjustments in the event of a  merger described in the preceding parenthetical (which shall in no event result  in a change in the relative interests in the Surviving Corporation of the  parties respective holders of capital stock from the relative interests  contemplated by this Agreement as currently structured) (ii) adversely affect  the tax treatment of Radians stockholders as a result of receiving the  Merger Consideration or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

      1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger and the certificate of merger (collectively, the "Articles of Merger") to be filed with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the "Wisconsin Department") and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"), respectively, on the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 

    

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and Section 180.1106 of the WBCL. 

    

 1.4 _Conversion of Radian Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of MGIC, Radian or the holder of any of the following securities: 

    

 (a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Radian issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Radian Common Stock"), except for shares of Radian Common Stock  owned by Radian as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by Radian or MGIC or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, shall be converted into the right to receive 0.9658 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of MGIC (together with the number of common share purchase rights (the "MGIC Stockholder Rights") attached thereto pursuant to that certain Rights Agreement, dated as of July 22, 1999, as amended and as may be further amended, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time, between MGIC and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "MGIC Rights Agreement"), (the "MGIC Common Stock"). 

    

 (b) All of the shares of Radian Common Stock converted into the right to receive MGIC Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and  shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective  Time, and each certificate (each a "Certificate") previously  representing any such shares of Radian Common Stock shall thereafter represent  only the right to receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole  shares of MGIC Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into  which the shares of Radian Common Stock represented by such Certificate have  been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e). Certificates  previously representing shares of Radian Common Stock shall be exchanged for  certificates representing whole shares of MGIC Common Stock and cash in lieu of  fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such  Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If,  prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of MGIC Common Stock or  Radian Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or  exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of  a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock  split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there  shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and  proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio. 

     (c) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Radian Common Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Radian or MGIC or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of MGIC or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

    

1.5 _MGIC Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
MGIC Common Stock and each share of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of MGIC ("MGIC Preferred Stock," and together with the MGIC Common
Stock, the "MGIC Capital Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

   

1.6 _Options; Performance Shares; Restricted Stock; Phantom Stock_. (a)
At the Effective Time, each option granted by Radian to purchase shares of
Radian Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Radian Common
Stock and shall (x) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, vest and
(y) be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of MGIC
Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided
below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Radian Group Inc. Equity
Compensation Plan and the other equity and equity-based compensation plans
listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Radian Disclosure Schedule (the "Radian
Stock Plans"), and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder (taking into
account any accelerated vesting of such options in accordance with the terms
thereof)):

       | (i) The number of shares of MGIC Common Stock to
be subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of Radian Common Stock subject to the original option and the Exchange
Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of MGIC Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share;
and    
---|--- 
   
       | (ii) The exercise price per share of MGIC Common
Stock under the new option shall be  equal to the exercise price per share of
Radian Common Stock under the original  option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
_provided_ that such exercise price  shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.    
---|--- 
   
   

 (b) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) the  performance goals applicable to each performance share granted by Radian based  on shares of Radian Common Stock which is outstanding immediately prior thereto  (a "Performance Share") shall be deemed to have been satisfied as of  the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target level, and (ii)  the Performance Shares shall be converted automatically into Performance Shares  with respect to a number of shares of MGIC Common Stock (and otherwise subject  to the terms of the Radian Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing grants  thereunder (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Performance  Shares in accordance with the terms thereof)) equal to the product of (A) the  number of shares of Radian Common Stock subject to the original Performance  Shares and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, that would be  issuable as a result of the target level performance goals being met and (B) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of MGIC Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Upon such conversion, the award agreements covering Performance Shares shall terminate. 

     (c) At the Effective Time, each restricted share of Radian Common Stock which is  outstanding immediately prior thereto shall (i) except as otherwise provided in  this Agreement, vest in full and no longer be subject to restriction and (ii) be treated in the manner contemplated by Section 1.4. 

    

 (d) At the Effective Time, each phantom share or deferred stock unit granted by Radian based on shares of Radian Common Stock which is outstanding immediately prior thereto (a "Phantom Share") shall (i) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, vest and (ii) be converted automatically into Phantom Shares with respect to a number of shares of MGIC Common Stock (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Radian Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Phantom Shares in accordance with the terms thereof)) equal to the product of the number of shares of Radian Common Stock subject to the original Phantom Shares and the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of MGIC Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

    

 (e) Radian shall take any and all actions with respect to Radians Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Radian ESPP") as are necessary to provide that (i) the Radian ESPP shall terminate, effective as of immediately before the  Effective Time; (ii) if the purchase period in effect as of the date of this  Agreement terminates prior to the Effective Time, the Radian ESPP shall be  suspended and no new purchase period will be commenced under the Radian ESPP  prior to the termination of this Agreement; (iii) if the purchase period in  effect as of the date of this Agreement will not terminate prior to the  Effective Time, then the end of the purchase period will be accelerated to a  date occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) no new purchase periods  will begin after the date of this Agreement. 

    

 (f) MGIC shall take all action reasonably necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of MGIC Common Stock for  delivery upon conversion, settlement and/or exercise of the foregoing awards  ("Radian Equity Awards"). Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event more than two business days thereafter), MGIC shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form)  registering a number of shares of MGIC Common Stock necessary to fulfill  MGICs obligations under this Section 1.6. 

    

 1.7 _Articles of Incorporation of MGIC_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of MGIC ("MGIC Articles"), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except that the MGIC Articles shall be amended, effective as of the Effective Time, to change the name of the Surviving Corporation as contemplated by Section 1.10(ii)(A) below. 

     1.8 _Bylaws of MGIC_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of MGIC, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that MGIC shall cause the Bylaws of MGIC to be amended as provided in Schedule A (the "Bylaw Amendment") effective as of the Effective Time. 

    

 1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

    

 1.10 _Headquarters of Surviving Corporation; Name_. From and after the Effective Time, (i) the location of the headquarters and principal executive offices of (A) the Surviving Corporation shall be Milwaukee, Wisconsin, (B) the mortgage insurance line of business shall be Milwaukee, Wisconsin and (C) the financial guaranty line of business shall be New York, New York, _provided_ that various functions of the Surviving Corporation may be based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the parties may mutually agree from time to time, and (ii) the name (A) of the Surviving Corporation shall be "MGIC Radian Financial Group Inc.," (B) used in the operation of the mortgage insurance line of business shall be "Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation" and (C) used in the operation of the financial guaranty line of business shall be "Radian Asset Assurance." No change to the foregoing clauses (i)(A), (i)(B), or (ii)(A) shall be effected absent the affirmative vote, taken following the Effective Time, of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the entire Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation. 

    

ARTICLE II

   

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

   

 2.1 _MGIC to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time, MGIC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to each of Radian and MGIC (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of MGIC Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of MGIC Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Radian Common Stock. 

    

 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of MGIC Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Radian Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of MGIC Common Stock to which such holder of Radian Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. 

     (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to MGIC Common Stock  shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder  thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.  After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the  record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other  distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become  payable with respect to shares of MGIC Common Stock represented by such  Certificate. 

    

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of MGIC Common Stock is to be issued in a  name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in  exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance  thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly  endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of MGIC Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

    

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Radian of the shares of Radian Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the  Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates  representing shares of MGIC Common Stock as provided in this Article II. 

    

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of MGIC Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with  respect to MGIC Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any  fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the  owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of MGIC. In lieu  of the issuance of any such fractional share, MGIC shall pay to each former  stockholder of Radian who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of MGIC Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of MGIC Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

      (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of  Radian for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be paid to MGIC. Any former  stockholders of Radian who have not theretofore complied with this Article II  shall thereafter look only to MGIC for payment of the shares of MGIC Common  Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and  distributions on the MGIC Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former  share of Radian Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to  this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, none of MGIC, Radian, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Radian Common Stock for any amount  delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned  property, escheat or similar laws. 

    

 (g) MGIC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this  Agreement to any holder of Radian Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by MGIC or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to holder of Radian Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by the MGIC or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

    

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to  be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by MGIC, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as MGIC may determine is reasonably  necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such  lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of MGIC Common Stock and any  cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to  this Agreement.

Radian has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Radian. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to MGIC, Radian or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided, however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include effects resulting from (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting mortgage insurance companies generally, except to the extent that any such changes have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on such party, or (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly permitted or required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Radian (the "Radian Certificate") and the Bylaws of Radian, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Radian to MGIC. 

      (b) Each Radian Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and,  where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all  jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or  leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so  qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Radian and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. 

    

 3.2 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of Radian consists of (i) 200,000,000 shares of Radian Common Stock, of which, as of February 5, 2007, 79,507,270 shares were issued and outstanding and 18,123,474 shares were held in treasury, and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Radian Preferred Stock" and together with the Radian Common Stock, the "Radian Capital Stock"), of which no shares are issued or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Radian Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except pursuant to the terms of options, Phantom Shares and Performance Shares issued (or to be issued in accordance with Section 5.2(b)) pursuant to the Radian Stock Plans, Radian does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Radian Capital Stock or any other equity securities of Radian or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Radian Capital Stock (collectively, the "Radian Rights"). As of February 5, 2007, no shares of Radian Capital Stock were reserved for issuance, except for 278,944 shares of Radian Common Stock reserved for issuance in connection with the Radian ESPP and 6,330,807 shares of Radian Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the Radian Stock Plans and the settlement of Performance Shares and Phantom Shares. Since February 5, 2007, Radian has not issued any shares of Radian Capital Stock or any Radian Rights, other than as permitted by Section 5.2(b) in the case of grants made following the date of this Agreement and pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options granted prior to such date. Radian has previously provided MGIC with a list of the aggregate number of options outstanding under the Radian Stock Plans as of February 5, 2007 and the weighted average exercise price for such options.

No Radian Subsidiary has or is bound by any  outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements  of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital  stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities  representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital  stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section 3.2(b) of the  Radian Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the material investments of  Radian in corporations, joint ventures, partnerships, limited liability  companies and other entities other than its Subsidiaries (each a  "Non-Subsidiary Affiliate").

Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of the business of Radian and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Radian, investigation into the business or operations of Radian or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2002, except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Radian. There (i) is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Radian or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business, operations policies or procedures of Radian since January 1, 2005, which, in the reasonable judgment of Radian, would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Radian. 

      3.6 _Financial Statements_. (a) The financial statements of Radian and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Radian Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Radian and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of Radian and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Radian and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Deloitte and Touche LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Radian as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Radian on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 

    

 (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Radian, neither Radian nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,  accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for  those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated  balance sheet of Radian included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the  fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 (including any notes thereto) and for  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past  practice since September 30, 2006 that are reflected in the financial statements included in Radians Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 24, 2007, or incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2006 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

    

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Radian and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Radian or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Radian. Radian (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) to ensure that material information relating to Radian, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Radian by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Radians outside auditors and the audit committee of Radians Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Radians ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who  have a significant role in Radians internal controls over financial  reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Radians  auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to  MGIC. There is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief  executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the  certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations  adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), without qualification, when next due. 

      (d) Since December 31, 2005, (i) neither Radian nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Radian or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Radian or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Radian or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Radian or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Radian or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Radian or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Radian.

 4.6 _Financial Statements_.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of MGIC as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with MGIC on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 

     (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MGIC, neither MGIC nor any of its  Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,  accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for  those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated  balance sheet of MGIC included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the  fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 (including any notes thereto) and for  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past  practice since September 30, 2006 that are reflected in the financial statements included in MGICs Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 18, 2007, or incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2006 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

MGIC (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to MGIC, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of MGIC by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to MGICs outside auditors and the audit committee of MGICs Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect MGICs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in MGICs internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to MGICs auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Radian.

      (d) Since December 31, 2005, (i) neither MGIC nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by MGIC or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of MGIC or any committee thereof or to any director or  officer of MGIC.

None of MGIC nor its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) that has not been satisfied in full. 

     (d) There are no pending or, to MGICs knowledge, threatened material labor  grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against MGIC or  any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries.

 4.12 _SEC Reports_. MGIC has previously made available to Radian an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January 1, 2002 by MGIC with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "MGIC Reports") and prior to the date hereof and (b) communication mailed by MGIC to its stockholders since January 1, 2002 and prior to the date hereof, and no such MGIC Report or communication, as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

MGIC and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in default under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries, except where neither the cost of such noncompliance or default nor the cost of compliance or cure of default would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MGIC.

To the knowledge of MGIC, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MGIC. MGIC is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MGIC.

in the event that the employment of a holder of such equity compensation

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

   

 6.1 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) MGIC and Radian shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and MGIC shall promptly (and in any case within 20 business days of the date of this Agreement) prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of MGIC and Radian shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and MGIC and Radian shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders. MGIC shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Radian shall furnish all information concerning Radian and the holders of Radian Capital Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

    

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best  efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all  applications, notices, petitions and filings (including the filing under the HSR Act), to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are  necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and to comply with the  terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. MGIC and Radian shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Radian or MGIC, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. 

      (c) MGIC and Radian shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information  concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders  and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of MGIC, Radian or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    

 (d) MGIC and Radian shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes  such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite  Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such  approval will be materially delayed. 

    

 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to the matters set forth in Schedule 6.2, each of MGIC and Radian, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, each of MGIC and Radian shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or state insurance laws (other than reports or documents which MGIC or Radian, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither MGIC nor Radian nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of MGICs or Radians, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

    

 (b) Each of MGIC and Radian shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or representatives  pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in  accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated January  12, 2007, between MGIC and Radian (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

    

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives  shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. 

    

6.3 _Stockholders  Approvals_. Each of MGIC and Radian shall call a
meeting of its stockholders (the "MGIC Meeting" and the "Radian Meeting,"
respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
voting upon the requisite stockholder approvals required in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger (including approval of the MGIC Articles by the
stockholders of MGIC to reflect the name change contemplated by Section 1.10)
and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual meeting of shareholders, and each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of
each of MGIC and Radian shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
the stockholders of MGIC and Radian, as the case may be, the vote in favor of
the approval of this Agreement (which shall include the amendment to the MGIC
Articles) required by the WBCL, in the case of MGIC, and the vote in favor of
the approval of this Agreement required by the DGCL, in the case of Radian,
in each case to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, MGIC or
Radian shall adjourn or postpone the MGIC Meeting or the Radian Meeting, as
the case may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to their
respective stockholders, in advance of a vote on the matters described above,
or, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of MGIC or Radian Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting, or if in the reasonable good faith
determination of either MGIC or Radian additional time is needed to solicit
an affirmative stockholder vote by the MGIC or Radian stockholders in order
to obtain the requisite vote for the foregoing matters; _provided_ that
the party so acting shall, at least three business days prior to any such
adjournment or postponement, notify the other party of the potential
adjournment or postponement and shall consult with the other party regarding
the necessity of such adjournment or postponement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of MGIC and Radian at the
MGIC Meeting and the Radian Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting
on the approval of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either MGIC or Radian
of such obligation.

     6.4   _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of MGIC and Radian shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Radian or MGIC or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    

 6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. MGIC shall cause the shares of MGIC Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

    

 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined, the Radian Benefit Plans and MGIC Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement (other than the Radian ESPP and such other benefit plans as may be mutually agreed) shall remain in effect with respect to employees of Radian and MGIC (and their respective Subsidiaries), respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to applicable law, the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such plans, modify any existing plans or adopt new benefit plans with respect to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "New Benefit Plans"). Prior to the Closing Date, Radian and MGIC shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the MGIC Benefit Plans and Radian Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans for the employees covered thereby. It is the intention of Radian and MGIC, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, to develop New Benefit Plans (including amending existing plans), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which, among other things, (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) do not discriminate between employees who were covered by MGIC Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by Radian Benefit Plans on the other, at the Effective Time. 

     (b) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any employees of MGIC or Radian (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Surviving Corporation shall: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such  employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous MGIC Benefit Plan or Radian Benefit Plan, as the case may be; (B) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a MGIC Benefit Plan or Radian Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (C) recognize all service of such employees with Radian and MGIC, and their respective affiliates, for all purposes (including, purposes of  eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New Plans; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits. 

    

 (c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all  benefits vested as of the date hereof under the MGIC Benefit Plans or the Radian Benefit Plans or under other contracts, arrangements, commitments, or  understandings described in the MGIC Disclosure Schedule and the Radian  Disclosure Schedule. 

    

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving  Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any MGIC Benefit Plans,  Radian Benefit Plans, or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or  understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law. Without  limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.10, nothing in this  Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other  person including without limitation any employee of MGIC or Radian, any right,  benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement  and no provision of this Section 6.6 shall constitute an amendment of any  benefit plan of MGIC or Radian. 

     6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of Radian or any of its Subsidiaries, including any entity specified in the Radian Disclosure Schedule (the "Radian Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Radian or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate, and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto, except that prior to the Effective Time, the foregoing obligation of MGIC with respect to the directors, officers or employees of Radian shall be only to cooperate. In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries, including any entity specified in the MGIC Disclosure Schedule (the "MGIC Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate, and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto, except that prior to the Effective Time, the foregoing obligation of Radian with respect to the directors, officers or employees of MGIC shall be only to cooperate. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Radian Indemnified Party and MGIC Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (to the extent, in the case of settlements, that the settlement was approved in writing by MGIC, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. It is understood that after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation may assume and control the defense of any claim for which the Surviving Corporation is obligated to provide indemnification under this Section 6.7(a),  _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any claim for which counsel has been retained with the approval of the applicable liability insurer (if such approval is required under the applicable insurance policy, if any, to obtain coverage) and commenced the defense prior to the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporations Audit Committee otherwise determines following the Effective Time. 

     (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Radian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  convert its directors and officers liability insurance policy in  effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Existing Policy")  to a policy that covers the insureds thereunder only for acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "Runoff Policy"). The  Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the  Runoff Policy, if any, or, if no such policy has been obtained, to maintain the  Existing Policy, for the benefit of such insureds, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) ( _provided_ that if despite such efforts neither of such policies can be maintained, the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies (i) having at least the same aggregate limits and with terms of coverage that in the Surviving Corporations best judgment are as favorable to the insureds as may be obtained from the market for directors and  officers liability insurance at the time taking into account the necessity to maintain coverage on an uninterrupted basis, or (ii) if such limits cannot be maintained, having the highest limits that may be obtained from such market taking into account such necessity). Effective at the Effective Time, coverage under the policies of directors and officers liability insurance that are maintained by the Surviving Corporation from time to time in its discretion shall not discriminate between MGIC Directors and Radian Directors (as such terms are hereinafter defined) or between persons who formerly were MGIC Directors or were Radian Directors. 

    

 (c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are  intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

    

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of MGIC, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Radian, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, MGIC. 

    

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. MGIC and Radian shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied or give rise to such termination right. 

    

 6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of MGIC and Radian shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of MGIC Common Stock and Radian Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Radian Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Radian Common Stock and any shares of MGIC Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

      6.11 _Executive Officers; Succession_. (a) In accordance with, and as provided in, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (as amended by the Bylaw Amendment), (i) effective as of the Effective Time, Curt Culver shall continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation and Sanford A. Ibrahim shall become President and Chief Operating Officer of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) (x) Mr. Ibrahim shall be the successor to Mr. Culver as Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, with such succession to become effective on (x) the date of the Surviving Corporations 2009 annual stockholders meeting (to be held on May 7, 2009) ( _provided_ that if the Effective Time occurs after July 1, 2007, the applicable date pursuant to this clause (x) shall be September 1, 2009) or (y) any such earlier date as of which Mr. Culver ceases for any reason to serve in the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, and (y) Mr. Ibrahim shall be the successor to Mr. Culver as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, with such succession to become effective on the date of the Surviving Corporations 2010 annual stockholders meeting (to be held in May 2010) (the "2010 Annual Meeting") or any such earlier date as of which Mr. Culver ceases for any reason to serve in the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation (the "Chairman Succession Date"). Until the Chairman Succession Date, the office of Chairman of the Board shall be deemed to be a relationship of employee and employer as between the Chairman, on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation, on the other. For the avoidance of doubt, occupany of the offices set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 6.11(a) shall not occur unless immediately prior thereto the occupant contemplated above is an employee of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates, it being understood and agreed that neither Mr. Culver nor Mr. Ibrahim may be terminated except as provided in Section 3.01(d) of the amended Bylaws as specified in Exhibit A. 

    

 (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the MGIC Board of Directors shall take such  actions as are necessary to cause the persons listed on Schedule 6.11(b) to be  elected or appointed as officers of the Surviving Corporation or one of its  Affiliates in the capacities listed opposite their respective names on such  Schedule as of the Effective Time, assuming that such persons are willing to  serve in such capacities. 

    

 6.12 _Post-Merger Board of Directors and Committees_. (a) Except as provided below in Section 6.12(b), from and after the Effective Time until the 2010 Annual Meeting, the total number of persons serving on the Board of Directors of MGIC shall be twelve (12), six (6) of whom shall be MGIC Directors and six (6) of whom shall be Radian Directors (as such terms are defined in subsection (c) below). The six (6) persons to serve initially on the Board of Directors of MGIC as of the Effective Time who are MGIC Directors shall be selected by the Board of Directors of MGIC prior to the Effective Time; and the six (6) persons to serve on the Board of Directors of MGIC as of the Effective Time who are Radian Directors shall be selected by the Board of Directors of Radian prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that (i) the MGIC Directors selected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall include Kenneth Jastrow and Mr. Culver and four (4) non-employee members of the current MGIC Board, and (ii) the Radian Directors selected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall include Herbert Wender, Mr. Ibrahim and, except as provided in Section 6.12(b), four (4) non-employee members of the current Radian Board. Two MGIC Directors and two Radian Directors shall be assigned to each of the three classes of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time as specified in Exhibit A. Mr. Wender shall be designated and shall serve as the lead director of the Surviving Corporation Board of Directors (with the scope of the responsibilities of such lead director being as defined by such Board) until the date of the Surviving Corporations 2009 annual stockholders meeting, and shall be nominated by the Surviving Corporation Board of Directors to stand for election at such meeting to serve as a director of the Surviving Corporation Board of Directors for the class of directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting in 2012 (for the avoidance of doubt, no MGIC or Board age- or tenure-related retirement policies or provisions shall be deemed to prevent such continued Board service by Mr. Wender through the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time). In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, any person so selected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time is unable or unwilling to serve in such position, the Board of Directors that selected such person shall designate another of its members to serve in such persons stead in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. Prior to the Effective Time, MGIC shall cause its Board of Directors to approve and adopt resolutions effecting the Board composition contemplated by this Section 6.12. 

      (b) As of the Effective Time, there shall be only five (5) Radian Directors on the  Board of Directors of MGIC until an additional director selected by the Radian  Directors is elected by MGICs stockholders. As promptly as practicable  following the Closing Date (and in any event within ten business days of the  Closing Date), the Corporation shall file with the SEC and furnish to its  stockholders a proxy statement, and call and hold a special meeting of its  stockholders with a record date that is the first business day following the  Effective Time, for the sole purpose of voting upon and electing a sixth  (6th) Radian Director as contemplated by Section 6.12(b), and shall  use its reasonable efforts in connection therewith. In the event that the sixth  Radian Director is not elected at that meeting or any postponement of such  meeting, the right to select such director shall continue and the Board of  Directors shall take such action as it may reasonably determine acting in good  faith to effect the Board of Directors composition contemplated by clause  6.12(a) above, and among other things the Radian Directors shall have the right  to nominate an additional Radian director at MGICs 2008 annual meeting.  The date when the sixth Radian Director is elected, whether occuring at the  special meeting or at a later time, shall be the "Equalization Date." 

    

 (c) From and after the Effective Time until the 2010 Annual Meeting, each of the  committees of the Board of Directors of MGIC shall be comprised of an equal  number of MGIC Directors and Radian Directors and the chairpersons of such  committees shall be drawn as nearly equally as possible from the MGIC Directors  and the Radian Directors. From and after the Effective Time until the  Equalization Date, the Board shall have an Executive Committee consisting of  Messrs. Culver, Ibrahim, Jastrow and Wender (with any vacancy created by the  loss of Messrs. Culver or Jastrow filled by the affirmative majority vote of the MGIC Directors and any vacancy created by the loss of Messrs. Ibrahim or Wender filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Radian Directors), which Executive Committee shall be formed and shall have a charter providing, together with such other matters as the parties may mutually agree, that such Committee shall approve (by majority vote of the entire such Committee) all non-ordinary course business to be brought before the full Board of Directors (other than such business as may be proposed by the Corporations committees responsible for discharging the duties imposed by the rules of the NYSE on audit, compensation and corporate governance/nominating committees). Except as provided herein, the identity of the members of such committees and the chairmen of such committees shall otherwise be as mutually determined by the parties. 

     (d) The term "MGIC Director" means (i) any person serving as a Director of  MGIC on the date of this Agreement who continues as a Director of MGIC at the  Effective Time and (ii) any person who becomes a Director of MGIC and who is  designated as such by the MGIC Directors as defined in clause (i) (or their  successors pursuant to this clause (ii)) prior to his or her election or  appointment to the Board of Directors by a majority of such directors; and the  term "Radian Director" means (A) any person serving as a Director of  Radian on the date of this Agreement who becomes a Director of MGIC at the  Effective Time and (B) any person who becomes a Director of MGIC and who is  designated as such by the Radian Directors as defined in clause (A) (or their  successors pursuant to this clause (B)) prior to his or her election or  appointment to the Board of Directors by a majority of such directors. For the  avoidance of doubt, the Board of the Surviving Corporation shall take such  action as is necessary to elect or appoint to the Board of the Surviving  Corporation any person who, in accordance with the immediately preceding  sentence, is designated a MGIC Director or a Radian Director. 

    

 6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, each Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its controlled Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (B) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, (C) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to or (D) have, or engage or participate in, any discussions with any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provisions of, or otherwise fail to exercise its rights under, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which such Party is a party or under which such Party has any rights with respect to the sale or transfer of the voting securities or any material portion of the assets of such Party, (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to the other Party the recommendation by such Partys Board of Directors of this Agreement to its stockholders or take any action or make any statement in connection with such Partys meeting of stockholders inconsistent with such recommendation, including any action to approve, recommend or endorse, or to propose to approve, recommend or endorse, any Acquisition Proposal (collectively, a "Change in Recommendation"), or (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other instrument contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or requiring such Party to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. 

    (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.13(a), prior to approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at its meeting of stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a Party (the "Acting Party") may, and may permit its Affiliates and its and their appropriate officers, directors agents and representatives to furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with, any Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to the Acting Party after the date of this Agreement and prior to the approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at its meeting of stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and may withdraw, modify or qualify the recommendation by such Partys Board of Directors of this Agreement to its stockholders in connection therewith, if and so long as (A) none of the Acting Party, any of its controlled Affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors, agents or representatives has violated any of the provisions of this Section 6.13, (B) the Board of Directors of the Acting Party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (C) at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to furnishing or causing to be furnished nonpublic information or data to, and participating in such negotiations or discussions with, such Person, the Acting Party provides the other Party with written notice of the identity of such Person and of the Acting Partys intention to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or to furnish or disclose nonpublic  information to, such Person, (D) prior to providing any nonpublic information to such Person, the Acting Party shall have entered into a confidentiality and  standstill agreement with such Person (a copy of which it shall have provided to the other Party) on terms no less restrictive upon such Person, in any respect, than the terms applicable to the other Party under the Confidentiality  Agreement, which confidentiality and standstill agreement shall not provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Acting Party or have the effect of preventing the Acting Party from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement, (E) at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to furnishing or causing to be furnished nonpublic information or data to such Person, the Acting Party furnishes such information to the other Party (to the extent such information has not been previously delivered or made available by the Acting Party to the other Party), and (F) prior to so withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the recommendation by its Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Acting Party gives the other Party five business days prior written notice of its intention to do so (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than five business days prior to the Acting Partys stockholders meeting, in which case the Acting Party shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable), and during such time, the Acting Party, if requested by the other Party, shall have engaged in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement (including by making its officers and its financial and legal advisors reasonably available to negotiate) such that the Board of Directors of the Acting Party may continue to recommend the approval of this Agreement. 

      

 (c) Each Party shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and its and their  appropriate officers, directors, agents and representatives to, immediately  cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations  conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Radian  or MGIC, as the case dictates, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each  Party will promptly (within one day) request each Person who has heretofore  executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of  acquiring such Party or any portion thereof (including any of its Subsidiaries)  to return all nonpublic information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of such Party and shall advise the other Party of the particulars of such request. Each Party will (i) promptly (within 24 hours) advise the other Party following receipt of any request for information, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry), (ii) promptly (within 24 hours) provide the other Party with all written materials received by such Party in connection with the foregoing, and (iii) keep the other Party apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis. Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. 

     (d) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any indication of interest in, an  Alternative Transaction received by a Party from any Person other than the other Party, in each case, whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to stockholders of such Party generally. As used in this Agreement, an "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction (or  series of related transactions) pursuant to which any Person (or group of  Persons), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of a Partys common stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger or that would be entitled to more than 15% of the fair market value of the outstanding equity interests of such Party, whether from such Party or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, business combination, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving a Party or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC), (iii) any transaction (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of such Party and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of its Subsidiaries) of such Party, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 15% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of such Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction (or series of related transactions), or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction (or series of related transactions) involving a Party or any of its Subsidiaries. 

    

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the 1934 Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

    

 (f) Any violation of this Section 6.13 by a Partys Affiliates or a Partys or any of its controlled Affiliates appropriate officers, directors, agents and representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by such Party. 

    

 6.14 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Assuming that Radian delivers to MGIC the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of MGIC, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Radian Insiders of MGIC Common Stock in exchange for shares of Radian Common Stock and the settlement or conversion of Radian Equity Awards (including the receipt of options on MGIC Common Stock upon conversion of options on Radian Common Stock), in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects regarding the Radian Insiders, the number of shares of Radian Common Stock held by each such Radian Insider and expected to be exchanged for MGIC Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of the options on Radian Common Stock held by each such Radian Insider and expected to be converted into options on MGIC Common Stock in connection with the Merger. "Radian Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Radian who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

     6.15 _Agreement of Affiliates_. Radian has disclosed in Section 6.15 of the Radian Disclosure Schedule each person whom it reasonably believes may be deemed an "affiliate" of Radian for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933 Act. Radian shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to MGIC, not later than the date of mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, a written agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit B.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by a single party under this Section 8.2 shall be $185 million. 

    

 (f) Each of MGIC and Radian acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if MGIC or Radian, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the fee set forth in this Section 8.2, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if MGIC or Radian, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable in this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made.

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

     8.4 _Extension; Waiver_.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

    

 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

shall control.

Composition._

has resolved that, effective as of the  Effective Time (as defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 6, 2007, by and between
Radian Group Inc. and the Corporation (the "Merger Agreement")), Curt Culver
shall continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation and Sanford A. Ibrahim shall become

be the successor to Mr. Culver as Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, with such succession to become effective on [the date of the
Corporations 2009 annual shareholders meeting (to be held on May 7,

reason to serve in the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation
(the "CEO Succession Date"), and (ii) Mr. Ibrahim shall be the successor to
Mr. Culver as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the  Corporation, with
such succession to become effective on the date of the  Corporations 2010
annual shareholders meeting (to be held in May 2010) or any such earlier date
as of which Mr. Culver ceases for any reason to serve in the position of
Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Chairman
Succession Date"), at which time Mr. Culver shall resign from the Board of
Directors.    (1)   Bracketed language to be changed to "September 1, 2009" if the 
Effective Time occurs after July 1, 2007. (c)(ii), effective as of the Effective Time,  the Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall be comprised of six (6)  Continuing Radian Directors,
including Mr. Ibrahim and Herbert Wender, and six (6) Continuing MGIC
Directors, including Mr. Culver and Kenneth Jastrow, divided into three equal
classes and designated as Class I (with a term expiring at the 2010 annual

serving in Class I, and (z) the remaining Continuing Radian Directors and
Continuing MGIC Directors evenly distributed among such classes. From and
after the Effective Time through the date of the Corporations 2010 annual
shareholders meeting: (i) except as provided in clause (c)(ii) below, the
number of directors that comprises the full Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall be twelve (12), including six (6) Continuing Radian
Directors and six (6) Continuing MGIC Directors; (ii) except as provided in

or provisions shall be deemed to prevent such continued Board service by
Mr. Wender through the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Time)). At

on the date of the Merger Agreement who continues as a Director of MGIC at
the Effective Time and (B) any person who becomes a Director of MGIC and who

directors; and the term "Continuing Radian Director" means (1) any person
serving as a Director of Radian on the date of the Merger Agreement who

connection therewith. In the event that the sixth Continuing Radian Director
is not elected at that meeting or any postponement of such meeting, the right
to select such director shall continue and the Board of Directors shall
take such action as it may reasonably determine acting in good faith to
effect  the Board of Directors composition contemplated by clause (c)(i)
above, and among other things the Continuing Radian Directors shall have
the right to nominate an additional Continuing Radian director at

appoint, Mr. Ibrahim Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation on the CEO
Succession Date and/or Chairman of the Board of Directors on the Chairman
Succession Date, (iii) the removal of Mr. Culver from, or the failure to
appoint or re-elect Mr. Culver to, the position of Chief Executive Officer of

this Section 3.01, shall each require the affirmative vote of at least eight
of the ten (or, prior to the Board Equalization Date, nine) non-

non-employee members of the Board of Directors designated as the Continuing
Radian Directors and Continuing MGIC Directors (including at least three non-
employee Continuing Radian Directors and three non-employee Continuing
MGIC Directors). In the event of any inconsistency between any provision
of this Section 3.01 or of Section 3.12(c) and any other provision of
these Bylaws or the Corporations other constituent documents,
the provisions of this Section 3.01 or of Section 3.12(c), as the case may

such business as may be proposed by the Corporations committees 
responsible for discharging the duties imposed by the rules of the NYSE on 
audit, compensation and corporate governance/nominating committees).

 _Exhibit B_

   

Form of Affiliate Letter

   

MGIC Investment Corporation 
MGIC Plaza 
250 East Kilbourn Avenue 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202

   

Ladies and Gentlemen:

   

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Radian Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Radian_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 6, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between Radian, and MGIC Investment Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation ("MGIC"), Radian shall be merged with and into MGIC (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 I represent, warrant and covenant to MGIC that in the event I receive any MGIC Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

   

 (a) The MGIC Common Stock to be received by me as a result of the Merger will be taken for my own account, and not for others, directly or indirectly, in whole or part, and I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of MGIC  Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

    

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer  or otherwise dispose of MGIC Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary  with my counsel or counsel for Radian. 

    

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of MGIC Common Stock to me pursuant to the  Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration  Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Radian I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Radian and the distribution by me of MGIC Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of MGIC Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to MGIC, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

    

 (d) I understand that MGIC is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or  other disposition of MGIC Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

        

* * *

    

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to MGICs  transfer agents with respect to MGIC Common Stock and that there will be placed  on the certificates for MGIC Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions  therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

        |  "The securities represented by this certificate have been
issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration
statement under said act or an exemption from such registration."   
---|--- 
   
   

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my MGIC Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, MGIC reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

        |  "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person
who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the
holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not
be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with
an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933."   
---|--- 
   
   

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to MGICs transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to MGIC (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MGIC, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to MGIC, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) evidence or representations reasonably satisfactory to MGIC that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. 

   

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. 

       

* * *

    

 By its acceptance hereof, MGIC agrees, for a period of two years after the Effective Time that it, as the Surviving Corporation, will use commercially reasonable efforts to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rules 145(d)(1) and (2) under the Securities Act are therefore available to the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any MGIC Common Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger. 

   

 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of Radian as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. 

        | Very truly yours,
