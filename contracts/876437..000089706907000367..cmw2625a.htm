Organization</U>. (a) Radian is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Radian has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Radian. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;Material Adverse
Effect&#148; means, with respect to MGIC, Radian or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (<U>provided,
however</U>, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be
deemed to include effects resulting from (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof
by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of
terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting mortgage insurance companies
generally, except to the extent that any such changes have a materially disproportionate
adverse effect on such party, or (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated
hereby or actions expressly permitted or required by this Agreement or that are taken
with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word &#147;Subsidiary&#148; when
used with respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies
of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Radian (the &#147;Radian
Certificate&#148;) and the Bylaws of Radian, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Radian to MGIC.  </FONT></P>

shares are issued or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Radian
Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,

otherwise receive any shares of Radian Capital Stock (collectively, the &#147;Radian

connection with the Radian ESPP and 6,330,807 shares of Radian Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the Radian Stock Plans and the
settlement of Performance Shares and Phantom Shares. Since February 5, 2007, Radian has
not issued any shares of Radian Capital Stock or any Radian Rights, other than as
permitted by Section 5.2(b) in the case of grants made following the date of this
Agreement and pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options granted prior to such

any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Radian or any of its Subsidiaries)
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Radian nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or otherwise as part of a

of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a &#147;distributing corporation&#148; or
a &#147;controlled corporation&#148; (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. Neither Radian nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a

Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of
MGIC, investigation into the business or operations of MGIC or any of its Subsidiaries

qualifying the           recommendation by its Board of Directors of this Agreement, the
Acting Party           gives the other Party five business days&#146; prior written

Party&#146;s           stockholders meeting, in which case the Acting Party shall provide
as much           notice as is reasonably practicable), and during such time, the Acting
Party, if           requested by the other Party, shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations to           amend this Agreement (including by making its officers and its
financial and           legal advisors reasonably available to negotiate) such that the
Board of           Directors of the Acting Party may continue to recommend the approval
