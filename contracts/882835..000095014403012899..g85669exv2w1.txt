Agreement, upon closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
Option will be cancelled and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive, on
a per share basis, with respect to the entire exercisable but unexercised

complete copy of the Patent Assignment Agreement (the "Patent Agreement"), dated
as of September 26, 2003, among Schlumberger S.A. ("Assignor"), Schlumberger

practices as so defined; (d) there is no strike, labor dispute, work slow down

of or under any collective bargaining agreement which is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Neptune Company; (f) no Neptune
Company has experienced any material work stoppage; and (g) no Neptune Company

         Section 3.14. Employee Benefit Plans. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Employee Plan" means any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, deferred
compensation, stock purchase, stock option, bonus or incentive plan, any
medical, vision, dental or other health plan, any life insurance plan, vacation,
severance, disability or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, or
arrangement, whether written or unwritten, including, without limitation, any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), which any of the Neptune
Companies maintains or contributes to or for which any of the Neptune Companies
has any actual, contingent, primary or secondary liability. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.14, no Neptune Company, or any entity which is considered to be
one company with any of such Companies pursuant to Section 1001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (an
"ERISA Affiliate") has sponsored, maintained or had any obligation with respect
to any Employee Plan which is a defined benefit plan as defined in Section 3(35)
of ERISA, or contributed to, participated in or had any obligation with respect
to, any multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Each
Employee Plan that purports to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
any trust under any such Employee Plan that purports to be exempt from income
tax under Section 501(a) of the Code has received one or more favorable
determination letters from the U.S. internal revenue service to such effect or
there is currently pending a request for such determination letter, or the
deadline for filing a request for such determination letter has not yet expired.
To the knowledge of the Company, each Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401 of the Code has been administered in all material respects
according to its terms, and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred which would be reasonably likely to adversely affect its qualified
status or the qualified status of any related trust. The Employee Plans are in
compliance in all material respects with all other Laws (including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code) applicable to Employee Plans. All material
reports and material disclosures relating to the Employee Plans required to be
filed with or furnished to any Governmental Entity have been filed or furnished
in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable Laws. With respect to any
Employee Plan, no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code) exists which could subject any of the
Neptune Companies or any "disqualified person" to any excise tax or penalty
pursuant to Section 502(1) of ERISA or under Section 4975 of the Code, except in
each case as have not resulted or would not result in damages to the Neptune
Companies in excess of $1,000,000. Each of the Neptune Companies has made full
and timely payment of all amounts which are required to be paid as contributions
to each Employee Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA). Each of the Neptune Companies has complied in all
material respects with the continuation coverage requirements of Part 6 of Title
I of ERISA, as amended. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
with any person which provides for any payment to any employee by any of the
Neptune Companies, which payment would not be deductible under Code Sections
162(m)(i) or 404 or would fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the
Code.

such shares. Purchaser further acknowledges that it has had access to the books
and records of the Company, is generally familiar with the business being
conducted by the Company and has had an opportunity to ask questions concerning
the Company and the Company's securities.

         Section 5.7. Financial Capability; Solvency.

                  (a)      Purchaser has entered into the Commitment Letter for
the purpose of ensuring that it has, immediately prior to the Closing, funds
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are not
contingent upon its ability to obtain any third party financing.

                  (b)      Immediately following the Closing, the Company will
be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to
the Company, means that, immediately following the Closing Date, (i) the amount
of the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such date, exceed
all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of such date, (ii) the
Company will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the Company
will be able to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature, taking into
account the timing of and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of
and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its indebtedness. The term
"Solvency" shall have its correlative meaning. For purposes of the definition of
"Solvent," (A) "Debt" means liability on a "Claim;" and (B) "Claim" means (i)
any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (ii) the right to an
equitable remedy for breach on performance if such breach gives rise to a right
to payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. "Present Fair Salable Value"
means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Company
(including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an
arms length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises.

         Section 5.8. No Outside Reliance. Purchaser has not relied on nor is it
relying on any statement, representation or warranty concerning the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or the Sellers or the Convertible Preferred Stockholders
other than those expressly made in this Agreement.

Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transactions contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) provided to such party relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that no party (and no employee,

thereunder) of the transactions contemplated herein (including the identity of
the parties, any information that could lead another to determine the identity
of the parties, any pricing or financial information (except to the extent such
pricing or financial information is related to the transaction's tax treatment
or tax structure), any other term or detail not relevant to the transaction's
tax treatment or the tax structure, or any other information to the extent that
such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or state securities
law). The foregoing is not intended to waive the attorney-client privilege or
other privileges, including the tax advisor privilege under Section 7525 of the
Code.

         Section 6.3. Certain Efforts. Each of the parties hereto shall use his,
her or its reasonable best efforts to perform such party's obligations hereunder

necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Law to obtain all regulatory
approvals and to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be completed in
accordance with the terms hereof and shall cooperate fully with each other party
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel,
accountants, and other designees in connection with any steps required to be
taken as a part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, including
without limitation:

                  (a)      Promptly upon execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers will use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as promptly as possible, or cause to
be prepared and filed, with the appropriate Governmental Entity, a notification
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
HSR Act, supply all information requested by such Governmental Entity in
connection with the HSR Act notification and cooperate with each other in
responding to any such request. Each of the parties shall cooperate with each
other in promptly filing any other necessary applications, reports or other
documents with any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in seeking necessary
consultation with and prompt favorable action by such Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall
not be required under the terms of this Agreement to dispose of or hold separate
all or any portion of the businesses or assets of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any of the Neptune Companies in order to remedy or otherwise
address the concerns (whether or not formally expressed) of any Governmental
Entity under the HSR Act or any other antitrust statute or regulation.

                  (b)      In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation,
or other proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced
which questions the validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby
or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties agree to cooperate and use
all reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation, or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is
issued in any such action, suit, or other proceeding, to use all reasonable
efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

                  (c)      Each party shall give prompt written notice to the
others of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence
or failure would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereby to
be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date hereof until the Closing or
that will or may result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
specified in Articles VII and VIII and (ii) any failure of any party hereto to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder. No such notification shall limit or otherwise
affect the terms of this Agreement or the Schedules delivered by the parties
pursuant to this Agreement on the date hereof.

                  (d)      The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing Date, shareholder approval meeting the requirements
of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 (as
if such Treasury Regulations were effective prior to January 1, 2004) with
respect to the acceleration of the vesting of the Options (as contemplated by
this Agreement). Within a reasonable period of time prior to seeking such
shareholder approval, the Company will deliver to Purchaser and its counsel a
copy of (i) the consent form on which such approval will be obtained and (ii)
the disclosure statement that will accompany such form.

         Section 6.4. No Public Announcement. Prior to the Closing Date, neither
Purchaser, the Company nor any Seller shall, without the approval of Purchaser
and the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any press
release or other public announcement to the


                                       34
<PAGE>

financial community, government agencies or the general public concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
any such party shall be so obligated by Law or applicable rules of the New York
Stock Exchange, in which case Purchaser and the Company shall be advised, and
Purchaser and the Company shall use their reasonable efforts to give the other
party the advance opportunity to review and comment on such release or
announcement.

         Section 6.5. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

                  (a)      Purchaser agrees that (i) the certificate of
incorporation or the bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
after the Closing shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liability that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries
of such provisions as those provisions that are set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries, respectively, on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years following the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Persons who at or prior to
the Closing were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification is required by law and (ii) all
rights to indemnification as provided in any indemnification agreements with any
current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing.

                  (b)      The parties agree that the Company (or a third party
at the direction of the Company) will pay an amount sufficient to enable the
Company to purchase "tail" coverage for a period of three years following the
Closing Date (or such longer period, up to a maximum of six years after the
Closing Date as shall be requested in writing by the Company to Purchaser at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) under the directors and
officers liability insurance policy of the Company, as in effect on the Closing
Date.

                  (c)      In the event Purchaser or the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Purchaser or the Company (as applicable) assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.5.

                  (d)      This Section 6.5, which shall survive the Closing and
shall continue for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit any
Person or entity referenced in this Section 6.5 or indemnified hereunder, each
of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.5 (whether or not parties
to this Agreement).

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or
the insurance policies contemplated by this Section 6.5, no provision or
indemnification right in such insurance policies shall limit in any way the
right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party or the obligation of any Seller
pursuant to Article X of this Agreement.

filed and those in preparation) of the Neptune Companies, and shall furnish to
Purchaser or its authorized representatives such additional information
concerning the Neptune Companies and their respective properties, assets,
businesses and operations as shall be reasonably requested. Nothing in this
Section shall be interpreted so as to grant Purchaser the right to perform
invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or locations of any of
the Neptune Companies.

         Section 6.7. No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals. The Company and
each of the Sellers agree that from the date hereof through the Closing Date or

after filing.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing Date, the Neptune Companies
shall make all required contributions and pay all premiums required under each

Law for periods on or before the Closing Date; (ii) to provide pro rata matching

which the Closing occurs, to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out of pocket
maximum or similar requirements under Purchaser's plans to the extent of amounts
previously credited for such purposes under the applicable Neptune Company plan,
but, if the Closing occurs after January 1, 2004, Purchaser will credit such
employees with payments toward the deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximum of Purchaser's plan provided that such employee provides Purchaser with
documentation that is reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; (iv) not apply to
such employees any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in Purchaser's plans
under the definitions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof, in each case in writing. The failure of any
party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the
validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of
this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.
